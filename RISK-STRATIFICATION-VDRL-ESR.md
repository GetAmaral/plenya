## VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory)

### Overview (VDRL)

**Test Type:** Qualitative/Semi-quantitative nontreponemal test
**Purpose:** Screening and monitoring for syphilis (Treponema pallidum infection)
**Antigen:** Cardiolipin-lecithin-cholesterol (lipoidal antigen)
**Method:** Flocculation test
**Result Format:** Non-reactive OR Reactive with titer (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128)

**IMPORTANT:** VDRL is NOT a continuous quantitative measure suitable for CSV risk stratification tables. It is a qualitative test reported as reactive vs. non-reactive with endpoint titers when positive.

### Test Interpretation

**Result Categories:**
- **Non-reactive:** No antibodies detected - suggests no current syphilis infection (if not previously treated)
- **Reactive:** Antibodies detected - positive screening requiring confirmation
- **Endpoint Titer:** The highest dilution yielding a reactive result (e.g., reactive at 1:16)

**Titer Reporting Standard (CDC 2024):**
> "Endpoint titers (the highest dilution yielding a reactive result) should be determined and clearly reported when testing serum with nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) assays that detect antibodies to lipoidal antigens (i.e., RPR and VDRL)."

### Titer Significance

**Titer Ranges and Clinical Meaning:**

| Titer Range | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Non-reactive** | Negative screening; no antibodies detected |
| **1:1 to 1:8** | Low titer - May indicate: <br>• Early primary syphilis<br>• Late latent/treated syphilis<br>• Biological false positive<br>• Serofast state |
| **1:16 to 1:32** | Moderate titer - Suggests: <br>• Active primary/secondary syphilis<br>• Untreated infection<br>• Increased neurosyphilis risk (≥1:32) |
| **1:64 to 1:256** | High titer - Indicates: <br>• Active secondary syphilis<br>• High disease activity<br>• High neurosyphilis risk |
| **>1:256** | Very high titer - Suggests: <br>• Acute secondary syphilis<br>• Very high disease burden |

**Key Clinical Principles:**

1. **Four-fold Change = Clinical Significance**
   - A change of 2 dilutions (e.g., 1:16 → 1:4 or 1:8 → 1:32) represents a clinically significant difference
   - Used to assess treatment response or reinfection

2. **Neurosyphilis Risk**
   - RPR/VDRL titers ≥1:32 indicate greater neurosyphilis risk
   - Requires neurological assessment and possible lumbar puncture

3. **Biological False Positives**
   - Generally present with low titers (≤1:8)
   - Common in autoimmune diseases (SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome)
   - Pregnancy, viral infections, recent vaccinations

### Clinical Stages of Syphilis

**Primary Syphilis (10-90 days post-exposure):**
- Painless chancre at exposure site
- VDRL: Often negative initially, becomes positive 1-4 weeks after chancre
- Titer: Usually 1:2 to 1:32
- Chancre heals spontaneously in 3-6 weeks

**Secondary Syphilis (4-10 weeks after chancre):**
- Systemic dissemination: rash (palms/soles), mucous patches, condyloma lata
- VDRL: Almost always positive (>99%)
- Titer: Typically high (1:32 to 1:256+)
- Most infectious stage
- Symptoms resolve spontaneously, enters latent stage

**Latent Syphilis:**
- **Early Latent:** <1 year duration, asymptomatic
- **Late Latent:** >1 year duration, asymptomatic
- VDRL: Positive with variable titers
- Titer: Usually low to moderate (1:4 to 1:32)
- Infectious risk low after early latent period

**Tertiary Syphilis (years to decades):**
- Cardiovascular syphilis (aortitis)
- Gummatous syphilis (granulomatous lesions)
- Neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis, general paresis)
- VDRL: May be negative (up to 30% non-reactive)
- Titer: Usually low if positive
- Not infectious but can cause severe organ damage

**Neurosyphilis (any stage):**
- Can occur at any stage, more common in secondary/tertiary
- Symptoms: meningitis, stroke, dementia, ataxia, Argyll Robertson pupils
- CSF VDRL: Highly specific (>99%) but only 30-70% sensitive
- Serum titer ≥1:32 increases risk

### False Positives

**Biological False Positive (BFP) Definition:**
- Positive VDRL/RPR with negative treponemal test (FTA-ABS, TP-PA, EIA/CIA)
- No current or past syphilis infection

**Common Causes of BFP:**

| Category | Specific Conditions |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Autoimmune** | Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)<br>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome<br>Rheumatoid arthritis<br>Sjögren syndrome |
| **Pregnancy** | More common in 3rd trimester<br>Resolves postpartum |
| **Infections** | Mycoplasma pneumoniae<br>Infectious mononucleosis (EBV)<br>Viral hepatitis<br>HIV infection<br>Malaria<br>Tuberculosis |
| **Other** | Recent vaccinations<br>Advanced malignancy<br>IV drug use<br>Older age (>80 years) |

**Characteristics of BFP:**
- **Titer:** Usually low (≤1:8, rarely >1:8)
- **Duration:** Transient (<6 months) or chronic (>6 months)
- **Confirmatory Test:** Negative treponemal test distinguishes from true syphilis

### Confirmatory Testing

**Testing Algorithm (CDC 2024):**

**Traditional Algorithm (Screening with nontreponemal):**
1. Screen with VDRL or RPR
2. If positive/equivocal → Confirm with treponemal test

**Reverse Sequence Algorithm (Screening with treponemal):**
1. Screen with treponemal EIA/CIA (high throughput)
2. If positive → Reflexively perform RPR/VDRL
3. If discordant → Perform second treponemal test (TP-PA or FTA-ABS)

**Confirmatory Treponemal Tests:**

| Test | Characteristics | 2024 CDC Recommendation |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| **TP-PA** (Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination) | • Sensitivity: 95-100%<br>• Specificity: 99%<br>• Remains positive for life<br>• Manual or automated | **PREFERRED** - Superior performance in head-to-head studies |
| **FTA-ABS** (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) | • Sensitivity: 84-100%<br>• Specificity: 96-98%<br>• Remains positive for life<br>• Labor-intensive, subjective | Less preferred vs. TP-PA |
| **EIA/CIA** (Enzyme/Chemiluminescence Immunoassay) | • Sensitivity: 95-100%<br>• Specificity: 98-99%<br>• Automated, objective<br>• Good for screening | Excellent for initial screening |

**Important Notes on FTA-ABS:**
- **False positives in lupus:** FTA-ABS specificity falls to 67.7% in autoimmune diseases
- **Pregnancy:** Can cause false-positive FTA-ABS
- **Limitations:** Subjective interpretation, requires fluorescence microscope
- **2024 Update:** TP-PA now preferred over FTA-ABS due to superior performance

**Discordant Results Interpretation:**

| VDRL/RPR | Treponemal EIA | TP-PA/FTA-ABS | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Positive | Positive | Positive | Active or past syphilis |
| Positive | Negative | Negative | Biological false positive |
| Negative | Positive | Positive | Treated syphilis, late latent, or very early infection |
| Negative | Positive | Negative | False positive EIA, no syphilis |

### Treatment Monitoring

**Expected Titer Response by Stage:**

| Stage | Treatment Response Timeline | Expected Outcome |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Syphilis** | 3-6 months post-treatment | ≥4-fold decline (e.g., 1:16 → 1:4)<br>Many serorevert to non-reactive by 12 months |
| **Secondary Syphilis** | 6-12 months post-treatment | ≥4-fold decline by 6-12 months<br>Seroreversion by 24 months in most |
| **Latent Syphilis** | 12-24 months post-treatment | ≥4-fold decline by 12-24 months<br>Seroreversion less common |

**Treatment Success Criteria:**
- **Primary/Secondary:** 4-fold titer decrease within 6 months
- **Latent:** 4-fold titer decrease within 12-24 months

**Treatment Failure Indicators:**
- Failure to achieve 4-fold decline in expected timeframe
- 4-fold increase in titer (suggests reinfection or treatment failure)
- Persistent or worsening symptoms

**Serofast State:**
- Definition: Titers remain persistently reactive after appropriate treatment
- Common in: Persons treated >1 year after infection, multiple syphilis episodes
- Typical titers: ≤1:8 (but higher titers possible)
- Management: Continue monitoring; no retreatment needed if stable and asymptomatic
- Frequency: More common in late latent syphilis

**Monitoring Schedule:**
- **Primary/Secondary:** Retest at 6, 12, 24 months post-treatment
- **Latent:** Retest at 6, 12, 24 months post-treatment
- **HIV-positive patients:** More frequent monitoring (3, 6, 9, 12, 24 months)

### Neurosyphilis and CSF VDRL

**Indications for Lumbar Puncture:**
- Neurological or ophthalmologic symptoms
- Tertiary syphilis (cardiovascular, gummatous)
- Treatment failure
- Serum RPR/VDRL ≥1:32
- HIV infection with late latent syphilis or unknown duration

**CSF VDRL Characteristics:**
- **Specificity:** >99% (highly specific - positive = neurosyphilis)
- **Sensitivity:** 30-70% (many false negatives)
- **Interpretation:**
  - Positive CSF VDRL = Definitive neurosyphilis diagnosis
  - Negative CSF VDRL does NOT exclude neurosyphilis

**CSF Findings in Neurosyphilis:**
- VDRL: Positive (but only 30-70% sensitive)
- WBC: >5-20 cells/µL (pleocytosis)
- Protein: >45 mg/dL (elevated)
- FTA-ABS: Highly sensitive (negative = excludes neurosyphilis)

**Neurosyphilis Treatment:**
- Requires IV penicillin G for 10-14 days
- Benzathine penicillin (IM) does NOT adequately penetrate CSF

**Post-Treatment Monitoring:**
- Repeat CSF exam at 6 months
- If CSF WBC not normalized → repeat treatment
- Continue monitoring every 6 months until WBC normal

## VHS/ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)

### Overview (ESR)

**Test Name:**
- ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) - English
- VHS (Velocidade de Hemossedimentação) - Portuguese
- VSG (Vitesse de Sédimentation Globulaire) - French
- Sed Rate - Common abbreviation

**Test Type:** Quantitative inflammatory marker
**Method:** Westergren (gold standard, ICSH-endorsed)
**Units:** mm/hour (mm/hr)
**Specimen:** Venous blood (EDTA tube)
**Principle:** Measures rate at which red blood cells settle in vertical tube over 1 hour

**Clinical Utility:**
- Non-specific marker of systemic inflammation
- Monitors chronic inflammatory conditions
- Screens for occult disease (infections, autoimmune, malignancy)
- Differentiates inflammatory vs. non-inflammatory conditions

**Limitations:**
- **Non-specific:** Does not identify cause or location of inflammation
- **Slow response:** Takes 24-48 hours to rise, weeks-months to normalize
- **Multiple confounders:** Age, gender, anemia, proteins, pregnancy
- **Not suitable for acute inflammation:** Use CRP for rapid changes

### Reference Ranges

**Conventional Laboratory Ranges (Westergren Method):**

**By Gender (Adults <50 years):**
- **Men:** 0-15 mm/hr (some labs use 0-14 mm/hr)
- **Women:** 0-20 mm/hr (some labs use 0-22 mm/hr)

**Age-Adjusted Formulas (Miller Formula):**
- **Men:** Upper limit = Age ÷ 2
  - Example: 60-year-old man → 60 ÷ 2 = 30 mm/hr upper limit
- **Women:** Upper limit = (Age + 10) ÷ 2
  - Example: 60-year-old woman → (60 + 10) ÷ 2 = 35 mm/hr upper limit

**2024-2025 Research Validation (Westergren Method):**

| Age Group | Gender | Westergren Range (mm/hr) |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------|
| 18-49 years | Male | 1-14 |
| 18-49 years | Female | 1-22 |
| 50-69 years | Male | 1-14 |
| 50-69 years | Female | 1-22 |
| ≥70 years | Male | 1-22 |
| ≥70 years | Female | 1-22 to 1-29 |

**Key Principle:** Women have ESR values approximately 5 mm/hr higher than men of the same age (Miller formula).

### Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges

**Functional/Integrative Medicine Perspective:**

Functional medicine focuses on optimal health and disease prevention rather than disease absence. Tighter ranges identify subclinical inflammation before conventional disease manifests.

**Optimal Ranges (Functional Medicine):**

| ESR Range (mm/hr) | Functional Medicine Interpretation |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| **<8** | **OPTIMAL** - Ideal for longevity, minimal inflammation |
| **8-10** | **OPTIMAL** - Acceptable optimal range |
| **10-15** | **ACCEPTABLE** - Slightly elevated, monitor for trends |
| **15-20** | **BORDERLINE** - Suboptimal, investigate sources |
| **20-30** | **MILD ELEVATION** - Significant inflammation, requires evaluation |
| **30-50** | **MODERATE ELEVATION** - Active inflammatory process |
| **50-100** | **HIGH ELEVATION** - Serious inflammation, urgent investigation |
| **>100** | **EXTREMELY HIGH** - 90% probability of serious underlying disease |

**Functional Medicine Rationale:**
- Values <10 mm/hr associated with optimal longevity and minimal age-related disease risk
- Range 10-20 mm/hr indicates subclinical inflammation increasing long-term health risks
- Early intervention at lower thresholds prevents progression to disease states

**Comparison: Functional vs. Conventional:**

| Approach | Men | Women | Philosophy |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Functional Medicine** | <8-10 | <8-10 | Optimize health, prevent disease |
| **Conventional Medicine** | <15 (age <50) | <20 (age <50) | Detect disease presence |

### Risk Stratification Table

**ESR Risk Stratification for Adults (Gender-Averaged, Functional Medicine Approach):**

This stratification uses functional medicine principles with tighter optimal ranges, averaged across genders for clinical simplicity. For precise interpretation, apply age and gender-specific adjustments.

| Level | ESR Range (mm/hr) | Risk Category | Clinical Significance |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Level 0** | <8 | Optimal | Ideal inflammatory status, minimal disease risk |
| **Level 1** | 8-10 | Optimal-Acceptable | Optimal health range, excellent longevity marker |
| **Level 2** | 10-15 | Low-Normal | Conventional normal, slight subclinical inflammation |
| **Level 3** | 15-20 | Borderline | Upper normal by convention, warrants investigation in functional approach |
| **Level 4** | 20-30 | Mild Elevation | Significant inflammation, evaluate for underlying causes |
| **Level 5** | 30-50 | Moderate Elevation | Active inflammatory process, requires diagnosis |
| **Level 6** | 50-100 | High Elevation | Serious inflammation (infection, autoimmune, malignancy) |
| **Level 7** | >100 | Extremely High | Critical - 90% probability of major disease (myeloma, GCA, vasculitis) |

**Interpretation Notes:**
- **Levels 0-1:** Optimal for preventive/longevity medicine
- **Levels 2-3:** Acceptable by conventional standards, but investigate trends and sources in functional approach
- **Levels 4-7:** Require medical evaluation and diagnosis

**Gender-Specific Adjustments:**
- **Women:** Add +5 mm/hr to thresholds for equivalent risk (e.g., 15 mm/hr in women ≈ 10 mm/hr in men)
- **Men:** Use table as listed

**Age-Specific Adjustments:**
- **Age <50:** Use table as listed
- **Age 50-70:** Add +5 mm/hr to Levels 2-3 thresholds
- **Age >70:** Add +10 mm/hr to Levels 2-3 thresholds
- **Levels 4-7:** Remain significant regardless of age (pathologic, not physiologic)

### Clinical Implications

**Conditions Associated with ESR Elevation:**

**Extremely High ESR (>100 mm/hr):**
- **Infections:** Severe bacterial infections, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis
- **Hematologic:** Multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, lymphoma
- **Rheumatologic:** Giant cell arteritis (GCA), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), systemic vasculitis
- **Other:** Metastatic cancer, severe tissue necrosis

**High ESR (50-100 mm/hr):**
- **Infections:** Pneumonia, pyelonephritis, systemic infections
- **Autoimmune:** Active SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease
- **Malignancy:** Various cancers with high inflammatory burden
- **Renal:** Nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease

**Moderate ESR (30-50 mm/hr):**
- **Infections:** Subacute bacterial infections, viral infections
- **Rheumatologic:** Rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies
- **Other:** Anemia (especially severe), pregnancy (2nd-3rd trimester), hyperlipidemia

**Mild ESR Elevation (20-30 mm/hr):**
- **Chronic inflammation:** Mild autoimmune activity, chronic infections
- **Metabolic:** Obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome
- **Lifestyle:** Poor diet, stress, inadequate sleep
- **Physiologic:** Aging, pregnancy

**Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) - Critical Diagnosis:**
- **ESR:** Typically >50 mm/hr (often >80 mm/hr)
- **Symptoms:** New headache, jaw claudication, vision changes, age >50
- **Urgency:** Requires immediate corticosteroids to prevent blindness
- **Note:** ~10% of GCA cases have normal ESR (use CRP as well)

**ESR vs. CRP (Complementary Use):**

| Characteristic | ESR | CRP |
|---------------|-----|-----|
| **Response Time** | Slow (24-48 hours) | Fast (6-8 hours) |
| **Normalization** | Slow (weeks-months) | Fast (days) |
| **Best Use** | Chronic inflammation, GCA/PMR, monitoring trends | Acute inflammation, bacterial infection, cardiovascular risk |
| **Affected By** | Age, gender, anemia, proteins | Less affected by confounders |

**Recommendations:** Use ESR and CRP together for comprehensive inflammation assessment.

**Low/Normal ESR Does NOT Exclude:**
- Localized infections
- Early inflammatory processes
- Conditions with normal acute phase response
- Approximately 10% of GCA cases

**Factors That Lower ESR:**
- Polycythemia
- Sickle cell disease
- Hypofibrinogenemia
- Heart failure
- Extreme leukocytosis

**Monitoring Frequency:**
- **Chronic disease monitoring:** Every 3-6 months
- **Acute inflammation:** Weekly until normalized
- **GCA/PMR treatment:** Every 2-4 weeks during taper
- **Preventive health:** Annually as part of comprehensive panel

### VDRL - NOT Suitable for CSV Stratification

**VDRL is qualitative/semi-quantitative and should NOT be included in continuous risk stratification CSVs.**

Instead, VDRL should be:
1. **Stored as categorical data:** Non-reactive, Reactive (with titer as string: "1:2", "1:8", "1:32", etc.)
2. **Interpreted clinically:** Based on titer level, clinical stage, and confirmatory testing
3. **Displayed in UI:** As qualitative result with interpretation guidelines

**Example Database Schema for VDRL:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE lab_results_vdrl (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id UUID NOT NULL,
    test_date DATE NOT NULL,
    result_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (result_status IN ('non_reactive', 'reactive', 'equivocal')),
    titer VARCHAR(10), -- e.g., '1:2', '1:8', '1:32', NULL if non-reactive
    titer_numeric INTEGER, -- e.g., 2, 8, 32 for trend analysis
    confirmatory_test_performed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    confirmatory_test_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'TP-PA', 'FTA-ABS', 'EIA'
    confirmatory_result VARCHAR(20), -- 'positive', 'negative', 'equivocal'
    clinical_interpretation TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
