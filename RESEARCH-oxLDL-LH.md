# Research Report: Risk Stratification for Oxidized LDL and LH
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Focus:** Functional Integrative Medicine (2023-2026 Literature)

---

## 1. OXIDIZED LDL (oxLDL) - LDL Oxidada

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR**

The literature from 2023-2026 strongly supports a **linear relationship** where higher oxLDL levels are progressively worse. There is no evidence of a U-shaped curve - low oxLDL is always better.

### Key Findings

#### Pathophysiology
- Oxidized LDL drives atherosclerosis by impairing endothelial function, promoting foam cell formation, and triggering vascular inflammation
- OxLDL accumulates in blood vessel walls and triggers immune response involving macrophages
- Macrophages engulf oxidized lipoprotein and become foam cells (early sign of atherosclerosis)
- Creates a "vicious cycle" of atherosclerosis and inflammation

#### Clinical Significance
- Circulating oxLDL associates with every stage of atherosclerosis
- Predicts myocardial infarction even after adjusting for age, gender, race, smoking, and metabolic syndrome
- More causally associated with CVD outcomes than LDL-C alone
- Useful biomarker for risk stratification in chronically inflamed patients

### Units of Measurement

OxLDL is measured in different units depending on the assay:
- **U/L (Units per Liter)** - Most common in research
- **ng/mL (Nanograms per Milliliter)** - Used by some commercial labs
- **mU/L (Milliunit per Liter)** - Less common

**Note:** Different assays use different methods, making universal ranges difficult. No assays are currently FDA-approved for routine clinical practice.

### Reference Ranges and Risk Levels

#### Using U/L Units (Most Common)

**Healthy Reference Values:**
- Mean in healthy young subjects: **63.23 ± 16.23 U/L**
- Males: 68.06 ± 17.69 U/L
- Females: 58.39 ± 13.6 U/L

**Risk Stratification for Metabolic Syndrome:**
- **<38 U/L**: Optimal (no metabolic risk factors)
- **<60 U/L**: Low risk
- **60-69 U/L**: Moderate risk (2.8-fold increased risk)
- **≥70 U/L**: High risk (3.5-fold increased risk)

**Cardiovascular Disease Populations:**
- Control subjects: 112.4 ± 3.3 U/dL (note: U/dL not U/L)
- Coronary heart disease: 201.3 ± 11.2 U/dL
- Highest risk: >97.4 U/L (top quintile in population studies)

#### Using ng/mL Units (Commercial Labs)

**Reference Ranges:**
- **LabCorp range**: 0-170 ng/mL (optimal: 10-170 ng/mL)
- **Healthy controls**: 108.36 ng/mL
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: 195.87 ng/mL
- **Metabolic Syndrome**: 200.24 ng/mL
- **T2DM + Hypertension**: 213.36 ng/mL

**Risk Thresholds:**
- **<124.2 ng/mL**: Lower risk
- **>124.2 ng/mL**: Increased metabolic syndrome risk (cutoff)
- **>7358.82 ng/mL**: Very high risk (4.6-fold increased likelihood of second ischemic event in CAD patients)
- **CAD patients average**: 6500 ng/mL (IQR: 5560-8320)

### Proposed Risk Stratification (U/L - Most Standardized)

```
Oxidized LDL (oxLDL)
| Nível 0 | Nível 1 | Nível 2 | Nível 3 | Nível 4 |
| ≥100 U/L | 70-99 U/L | 60-69 U/L | 48-59 U/L | <48 U/L |
U/L | Varies by assay - ng/mL conversion not standardized
```

**Rationale:**
- Nível 0 (≥100 U/L): Very high risk - associated with CVD in multiple studies
- Nível 1 (70-99 U/L): High risk - 3.5x increased metabolic syndrome risk
- Nível 2 (60-69 U/L): Moderate risk - 2.8x increased risk
- Nível 3 (48-59 U/L): Low risk - above optimal but below risk thresholds
- Nível 4 (<48 U/L): Optimal - associated with absence of metabolic risk factors

### Functional Medicine Interventions

**Dietary:**
- Increased consumption of high-antioxidant plant-based foods (berries, nuts)
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Green tea (inhibits LDL oxidation)
- Curcumin (prevents LDL oxidation)
- Sustained linoleic acid reduction (lowers oxLDL by ~15%)

**Lifestyle:**
- Smoking cessation
- Blood pressure control
- Blood sugar management
- Inflammation management
- CoQ10 supplementation

### Literature Support (2023-2026)

1. **2025 Study** - CAD patients with ≥2 ischemic events showed significantly higher oxLDL (8293.35 ng/mL) vs single event patients
2. **2023 Systematic Review** - OxLDL associates with CVD through vicious cycle of atherosclerosis and inflammation
3. **2023 Meta-analysis** - Elevated circulating oxLDL associated with adverse CVD outcomes across multiple stages
4. **2024 Integrative Medicine** - OxLDL measurement crucial for cardiometabolic risk assessment beyond standard lipid panels

## 2. LH (LUTEINIZING HORMONE) - Hormônio Luteinizante

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (Context-Dependent)**

LH demonstrates U-shaped risk curves in most contexts - both very low and very high values indicate pathology. Optimal ranges vary dramatically by sex, menstrual cycle phase, and menopausal status.

### Key Findings

#### Pathophysiology

**In Women:**
- Produced by anterior pituitary in response to GnRH
- Triggers ovulation approximately 24-36 hours after LH surge (mid-cycle)
- Works with FSH to regulate menstrual cycle and ovarian function
- Dramatically elevated in menopause (ovarian failure)

**In Men:**
- Stimulates Leydig cells in testes to produce testosterone
- Operates through negative feedback loop with testosterone
- Low = secondary hypogonadism (pituitary/hypothalamic dysfunction)
- High = primary hypogonadism (testicular failure)

#### Clinical Significance

**Very Low LH:**
- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
- Pituitary dysfunction
- Hypothalamic dysfunction
- Secondary infertility

**Very High LH:**
- Primary gonadal failure
- PCOS in women (with elevated LH/FSH ratio)
- Testicular failure in men
- Menopause in women

### Units of Measurement

- **IU/L** (International Units per Liter)
- **mIU/mL** (milliInternational Units per milliliter)

**Note:** 1 IU/L = 1 mIU/mL (equivalent units)

---

### CONTEXT 1: Women - Follicular Phase (Day 1-14)

**Risk Curve:** U-shaped

#### Reference Ranges from Literature:
- 1.1 to 11.6 mIU/mL
- 1.68-15 IU/L
- 1.9-14.6 mIU/mL
- 2.4-12.6 mIU/mL

**Consensus Range:** 1.1-15 IU/L

#### Clinical Interpretation:
- **Very Low (<1.1)**: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, pituitary dysfunction
- **Low-Normal (1.1-2.4)**: May indicate pituitary reserve issues
- **Optimal (2.4-12.6)**: Normal follicular phase
- **High-Normal (12.6-15)**: Upper limit of normal
- **Elevated (>15)**: May indicate PCOS, approaching ovulation, or perimenopausal changes

#### Proposed Risk Stratification:

```
LH - Follicular Phase (Women, Day 1-14)
| Nível 0 | Nível 1 | Nível 2 | Nível 3 | Nível 4 |
| <1.0 mIU/mL | >20 mIU/mL | 1.0-2.0 ou 15-20 mIU/mL | 2.0-2.5 ou 12-15 mIU/mL | 2.5-12 mIU/mL |
mIU/mL | 1 mIU/mL = 1 IU/L
```

---

### CONTEXT 2: Women - Ovulation (Mid-Cycle)

**Risk Curve:** Not U-shaped (linear - need surge)

#### Reference Ranges from Literature:
- 17 to 77 mIU/mL
- 12.2-118.0 mIU/mL
- 14.0-95.6 mIU/mL
- 21.9-56.6 IU/L

**Consensus Range:** 14-100 mIU/mL (surge levels)
**Average Surge:** 44.6 mIU/mL
**Minimum to trigger ovulation:** 6.5 mIU/mL
**Maximum observed:** 101-118 mIU/mL

#### Clinical Interpretation:
- **No Surge (<12)**: Anovulation, infertility risk
- **Minimal Surge (12-20)**: May be sufficient but suboptimal
- **Normal Surge (20-80)**: Adequate for ovulation
- **High Surge (>80)**: Upper range but normal variation

#### Proposed Risk Stratification:

```
LH - Ovulation Surge (Women, Mid-Cycle)
| Nível 0 | Nível 1 | Nível 2 | Nível 3 |
| <12 mIU/mL | 12-20 mIU/mL | 20-50 mIU/mL | 50-100 mIU/mL |
mIU/mL | 1 mIU/mL = 1 IU/L
```

**Note:** This is less of a "risk" stratification and more of an "adequacy" stratification since the surge is a desired event.

---

### CONTEXT 3: Women - Luteal Phase (Day 14-28)

**Risk Curve:** U-shaped

#### Reference Ranges from Literature:
- 1 to 14.7 mIU/mL
- 0.61-16.3 IU/L
- 0.7-12.9 mIU/mL
- 1.0-11.4 mIU/mL

**Consensus Range:** 0.7-16 IU/L

#### Clinical Interpretation:
- **Very Low (<0.7)**: Luteal phase defect, inadequate corpus luteum
- **Low-Normal (0.7-1.5)**: May indicate inadequate progesterone support
- **Optimal (1.5-12)**: Normal luteal phase
- **High-Normal (12-16)**: Upper limit of normal
- **Elevated (>16)**: May indicate early menopause, PCOS, or cycle irregularity

#### Proposed Risk Stratification:

```
LH - Luteal Phase (Women, Day 14-28)
| Nível 0 | Nível 1 | Nível 2 | Nível 3 | Nível 4 |
| <0.5 mIU/mL | >20 mIU/mL | 0.5-1.0 ou 15-20 mIU/mL | 1.0-2.0 ou 12-15 mIU/mL | 2.0-12 mIU/mL |
mIU/mL | 1 mIU/mL = 1 IU/L
```

---

### CONTEXT 4: Women - Post-Menopause

**Risk Curve:** Modified (elevated is expected)

#### Reference Ranges from Literature:
- 14.2-52.3 IU/L
- 19.3-100.6 IU/L
- Generally >30 IU/L common

**Consensus Range:** 15-100 IU/L (elevated is normal)

#### Clinical Interpretation:
- **Too Low (<15)**: Unexpected in menopause - may indicate hormonal therapy effect or pituitary dysfunction
- **Normal Postmenopausal (15-100)**: Expected physiological response to ovarian failure
- **Very High (>100)**: May indicate primary ovarian failure, though still within pathological range

**Important:** In postmenopause, FSH is typically higher than LH. The ratio changes.

#### Proposed Risk Stratification:

```
LH - Post-Menopause (Women)
| Nível 0 | Nível 1 | Nível 2 | Nível 3 |
| <10 mIU/mL | >120 mIU/mL | 10-20 mIU/mL | 20-100 mIU/mL |
mIU/mL | 1 mIU/mL = 1 IU/L
```

**Note:** In postmenopause, elevated LH is physiologically normal. "Optimal" means appropriate for menopausal status.

### CONTEXT 5: Men

**Risk Curve:** U-shaped

#### Reference Ranges from Literature:
- 1.5 to 9.3 IU/L
- 1.8 to 8.6 IU/L
- 1 to 9 mIU/mL

**Consensus Range:** 1.5-9 IU/L

#### Clinical Interpretation:

**Very Low (<1.5):**
- Secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism
- Pituitary dysfunction
- Hypothalamic dysfunction
- Kallmann syndrome
- Often associated with low testosterone

**Normal (1.5-9):**
- Normal testicular and pituitary function
- In homeostasis, LH levels typically low-normal

**Elevated (>9):**
- Primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism
- Testicular failure
- Klinefelter syndrome
- Orchitis, trauma, or testicular damage
- Body trying to stimulate testes but they're not responding
- Often associated with low testosterone despite high LH

#### Proposed Risk Stratification:

```
LH - Men (Adult)
| Nível 0 | Nível 1 | Nível 2 | Nível 3 | Nível 4 |
| <1.0 mIU/mL | >15 mIU/mL | 1.0-1.5 ou 10-15 mIU/mL | 1.5-2.0 ou 9-10 mIU/mL | 2.0-9.0 mIU/mL |
mIU/mL | 1 mIU/mL = 1 IU/L
```

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: LH/FSH Ratio in PCOS

#### 2024 JSOG Guidelines (Adolescents):
**Platform-specific cutoffs:**

**Architect® platform:**
- LH ≥ 7.1 mIU/mL
- LH/FSH ratio ≥ 1.21

**Elecsys® platform:**
- LH ≥ 9.9 mIU/mL
- LH/FSH ratio ≥ 1.51

#### Body Type Considerations:
- **Non-obese patients:** Both elevated LH AND high LH/FSH ratio required
- **Obese patients (BMI ≥25):** High LH/FSH ratio alone suffices
- **Note:** BMI has strong negative correlation with LH in PCOS

#### General PCOS Patterns:
- Normal LH:FSH ratio: 1:1 to 2:1
- PCOS LH:FSH ratio: Often 2:1 to 3:1 or higher
- Found in ~50% of PCOS patients (not all)

#### Clinical Notes:
- LH/FSH ratio no longer sole diagnostic criterion (ESHRE/ASRM 2023)
- Must combine with menstrual abnormalities and hyperandrogenism
- AMH introduced as alternative to ultrasound (2023 guidelines)

## Implementation Notes for Plenya System

### Database Considerations:

1. **oxLDL:**
   - Single table with 5 risk levels (linear)
   - Unit: U/L (primary), with note about assay variation
   - No context dependencies

2. **LH:**
   - Requires context field: `follicular`, `ovulation`, `luteal`, `postmenopausal`, `male`
   - Each context has different risk stratification table
   - Must collect additional data:
     - Sex
     - If female: menstrual cycle day or menopausal status
     - If PCOS suspected: FSH for ratio calculation

### Clinical Decision Support:

1. **oxLDL Alerts:**
   - ≥70 U/L: High cardiovascular risk - recommend lifestyle intervention
   - ≥100 U/L: Very high risk - urgent cardiology referral

2. **LH Alerts:**
   - Context-dependent
   - Consider FSH ratio for PCOS screening
   - Flag discordant results (e.g., low LH with high testosterone = investigate)

### Functional Medicine Approach:

Both markers emphasize:
- Root cause investigation
- Lifestyle interventions first
- Advanced biomarker tracking
- Personalized optimal ranges (not just "normal")
- Prevention over treatment
