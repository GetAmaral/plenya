## Scientific Articles Added

### 1. Dehydroepiandrosterone and Bone Health: Mechanisms and Insights (2024)
- **Authors:** Mohamad NV, Che Razali NS, Mohd Shamsuddin NA
- **Journal:** Biomedicines
- **Date:** December 2024
- **DOI:** 10.3390/biomedicines12122780
- **Type:** Review
- **Key Findings:** DHEA supplementation (50-75 mg/day) significantly increased bone mineral density, particularly in the femoral neck in men with age-related hormone decline. Effects mediated by IGF-1, MAPK, PI3K, and BMP2 signaling cascades.

### 2. DHEA-S on Lifespan in Men Using Mendelian Randomization (2025)
- **Authors:** Various Authors
- **Journal:** Mechanisms of Ageing and Development
- **Date:** January 2025
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.mad.2025.111998
- **Type:** Research Article
- **Key Findings:** Elevated DHEA-S associated with reduced lifespan in men (-1.15 years per log μmol/L). DHEA-S positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in men, raising concerns about unregulated supplementation.

### 3. DHEA-S Predicts 5-Year CHD Risk in Elderly Men (2014)
- **Authors:** Tivesten A, Vandenput L, Carlzon D, et al.
- **Journal:** Journal of the American College of Cardiology
- **Date:** August 2014
- **DOI:** 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.05.076
- **Type:** Research Article
- **Key Findings:** Prospective study of 2,416 men (69-81 years) showed low DHEA and DHEA-S levels inversely associated with coronary heart disease events (HR 0.82-0.86 per SD increase). Particularly predictive in younger men within cohort.

### 4. DHEA-S Predicts Cardiovascular Mortality in Swedish Men (2010)
- **Authors:** Ohlsson C, Labrie F, Barrett-Connor E, et al.
- **Journal:** Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism
- **Date:** September 2010
- **DOI:** 10.1210/jc.2010-0760
- **Type:** Research Article
- **Key Findings:** Study of 2,644 Swedish men (69-81 years) demonstrated low DHEA-S predicts all-cause mortality (HR 1.54), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.61), and ischemic heart disease mortality (HR 1.67). More pronounced in younger men (CVD mortality HR 2.64 vs 1.30).

## Clinical Content Summary

### Clinical Relevance (1,651 chars)
Establishes DHEA-S measurement in men 50-59 as a critical endocrine marker for:
- Adrenal aging assessment (adrenopause)
- Cardiometabolic risk stratification
- Bone health evaluation
- Cognitive function monitoring
- Metabolic syndrome prediction

**Key Clinical Points:**
- DHEA-S levels typically 40-50% below peak by this age
- Low DHEA-S (< 80 µg/dL) predicts:
  - 5-year CHD events (HR 0.86 per SD)
  - CV mortality (HR 1.61)
  - All-cause mortality (HR 1.54)
- Accelerated bone density loss (1%/year)
- Increased metabolic syndrome risk in non-obese men
- Recent data shows very high levels may increase blood pressure

### Patient Explanation (1,587 chars)
Patient-friendly Portuguese explanation covering:
- What DHEA-S is (adrenal hormone, precursor)
- Normal age-related decline (adrenopause)
- Why testing matters at 50-59 years
- Health systems affected:
  - Bone health (stimulates bone formation)
  - Cardiovascular protection
  - Glucose and fat metabolism
  - Muscle strength and energy
  - Cognitive function
- Significance of low vs. high values
- How doctors use this marker for prevention

### Conduct (3,820 chars)
Comprehensive clinical protocol including:

**1. Interpretation by Ranges**
- < 80 µg/dL: Significant decline, CV risk
- 80-150 µg/dL: Borderline, monitor
- 150-350 µg/dL: Adequate for age
- > 400 µg/dL: Uncommon, assess BP
- > 600 µg/dL: Rule out adrenal tumor

**2. Complementary Evaluation**
- Hormonal panel (testosterone, SHBG, cortisol, TSH)
- Metabolic markers (glucose, lipids, hsCRP)
- Bone density (DXA) if DHEA-S < 100
- Andropause symptom assessment
- Rule out secondary causes

**3. Cardiovascular Risk Stratification**
- Calculate Framingham score
- ECG, echocardiogram, stress test
- Optimize modifiable risk factors
- Cardiac biomarkers if high risk

**4. Non-Pharmacological Interventions**
- Resistance exercise 3-4x/week
- Aerobic exercise 150min/week
- Sleep optimization (7-9h/night)
- Stress management
- Mediterranean/anti-inflammatory diet
- Weight maintenance (BMI 20-25)
- Vitamin D supplementation if deficient

**5. DHEA Supplementation**
- **Current evidence (2024-2025):** Does NOT support routine supplementation
- Systematic reviews show inconsistent benefits
- Recent Mendelian data suggests risks (reduced lifespan, increased BP)
- If considered: 25-50 mg/day
- Monitor: DHEA-S, testosterone, estradiol, PSA, hematocrit, BP q3mo
- Discontinue if: PSA increase > 1.4 ng/mL/year, Hct > 54%, adverse effects

**6. Longitudinal Monitoring**
- Annual DHEA-S measurement in borderline/low cases
- Track decline trajectory (steep decline = higher mortality)
- Document symptoms, body composition, bone density, CV function

**7. Referral Criteria**
- Endocrinologist: DHEA-S < 50, adrenal insufficiency suspected, adrenal tumor, primary hypogonadism
- Cardiologist: High CV risk or established disease

## Clinical Impact

This enrichment provides clinicians with:

1. **Evidence-based risk stratification** for men 50-59 using DHEA-S
2. **Actionable clinical protocols** for interpretation and intervention
3. **Current 2024-2025 evidence** on DHEA supplementation (not recommended routinely)
4. **Cardiovascular risk prediction** tools based on prospective studies
5. **Comprehensive lifestyle interventions** as first-line approach
6. **Clear referral criteria** for specialist care

---

## Key Clinical Takeaways

1. **DHEA-S < 80 µg/dL** in men 50-59 is a red flag for increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality
2. **Fifth decade is critical** - DHEA-S decline more predictive in younger vs. older men
3. **Supplementation NOT routinely recommended** - 2025 Mendelian data shows potential harm
4. **Lifestyle first** - exercise, sleep, stress management more evidence-based
5. **Monitor trajectory** - steep decline more important than absolute level
6. **Integrate with other markers** - testosterone, metabolic, inflammatory markers
