## Clinical Content Summary

### Clinical Relevance Highlights:
- **Reference Range:** 10-55 ng/dL (0.35-1.9 nmol/L) for premenopausal women
- **PCOS Prevalence:** 10-13% of reproductive-age women
- **Diagnostic Threshold:** >70 ng/dL indicates significant hyperandrogenism
- **Rotterdam Criteria:** 2 of 3 features required (ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic morphology, hyperandrogenism)
- **Test Sensitivity:** Free testosterone 70% vs. total testosterone 33% detection rate
- **Metabolic Risk:** Elevated testosterone (>3.0 nmol/L) linked to MASLD, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome
- **Timing:** Morning collection in early follicular phase; recent studies show minimal menstrual cycle variation

### Patient Explanation Highlights:
- **Normal Range:** 10-55 ng/dL clearly explained
- **Symptoms of Elevation:** Irregular menses, hirsutism, acne, hair loss, infertility, abdominal weight gain
- **PCOS Context:** Affects 1 in 8 women; can present with normal testosterone levels
- **Health Risks:** Insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease
- **Early Detection Value:** Treatment prevents long-term complications
- **Collection Timing:** Morning preferred, early cycle ideal but less critical than previously thought

### Conduct Highlights:

**Assessment Protocol:**
- Confirm with morning total testosterone in follicular phase
- Order free testosterone if total is normal but clinical suspicion high
- Objective hirsutism scoring (modified Ferriman-Gallwey ≥6)
- Apply Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis
- Rule out differentials: CAH, tumors (testosterone >150 ng/dL), Cushing's, hyperprolactinemia
- Comprehensive metabolic panel: glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, lipids, liver function

**Treatment Strategy:**
- **First-line:** Combined oral contraceptives (estrogen-progestin)
- **Second-line:** Add antiandrogen after 6 months (spironolactone 50-200 mg/day, cyproterone acetate, finasteride)
- **Avoid:** Flutamide (hepatotoxicity)
- **Insulin Resistance:** Metformin 1500-2000 mg/day if HOMA-IR >2.5
- **Lifestyle:** 5-10% weight loss, low glycemic index diet, 150 min/week aerobic + resistance training
- **Cosmetic:** Laser/electrolysis hair removal, topical eflornithine

**Monitoring:**
- Reassess testosterone, metabolic panel, liver function every 3-6 months
- Annual diabetes screening (fasting glucose or HbA1c)
- Cardiovascular risk assessment (BP, lipids, waist circumference)
- Screen for sleep apnea if symptomatic
- Psychological support for quality of life impact

**Reproductive Planning:**
- Stop contraceptives if pregnancy desired
- Ovulation induction: clomiphene citrate or letrozole
- Refer to assisted reproduction after 6 failed induction cycles
