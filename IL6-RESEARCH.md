# IL-6 (Interleukin-6) Risk Stratification - Functional Integrative Medicine

**Research Date:** January 2026
**Literature Period:** 2023-2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Risk Curve Type:** LINEAR (lower is always better for longevity)
**Primary Unit:** pg/mL
**Conversion:** 1 pg/mL = 1 ng/L = ~41.7 pmol/L (MW ~24 kDa)

### Key Findings

1. **IL-6 shows a LINEAR dose-response relationship** - Lower levels are consistently associated with better cardiovascular outcomes, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality
2. **No U-shaped curve detected** - Evidence does not support adverse effects of very low IL-6 in healthy individuals
3. **Strong predictor** - IL-6 outperforms hs-CRP for mortality prediction across multiple studies
4. **Inflammaging marker** - Central biomarker for chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging

## Literature Evidence

### 1. Risk Curve Type: LINEAR

**Evidence for Linear Relationship:**

- **Mendelian Randomization (2024):** Genetically mediated reduction in IL-6 signaling associates with lower risk of atrial fibrillation, stroke, coronary artery disease, and increased longevity (parental age at death). No lower threshold identified.

- **MESA Study (2024):** Clear dose-response across terciles with no evidence of harm at lowest levels:
  - Tercile 1 (median 0.65 pg/mL): Reference
  - Tercile 2 (median 1.21 pg/mL): HR 1.40 all-cause mortality
  - Tercile 3 (median 2.32 pg/mL): HR 1.98 all-cause mortality

- **Meta-analysis:** Linear increases in risk of future coronary heart disease and MI according to increasing quintiles of IL-6, with no inflection point at low levels.

**No U-Shaped Evidence:**

- Healthy individuals with undetectable IL-6 (<3 pg/mL) show no immune impairment
- IL-6 receptor deficiency (genetic) causes problems, but low baseline IL-6 in healthy individuals does not
- Population studies show consistently better outcomes at lowest measurable levels

---

### 3. Cardiovascular Disease Risk Stratification

**MESA Cohort (2024) - Healthy Adults:**
- 6,622 participants, multi-ethnic cohort
- Median follow-up: 17.7 years

| Tercile | Median IL-6 | All-Cause Mortality HR | CV Mortality HR |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| T1 (lowest) | 0.65 pg/mL | 1.00 (reference) | 1.00 (reference) |
| T2 (middle) | 1.21 pg/mL | 1.40 (1.18-1.65) | 1.28 (0.87-1.88) |
| T3 (highest) | 2.32 pg/mL | 1.98 (1.67-2.36) | 1.55 (1.05-2.30) |

**Heart Failure Populations:**

---

### 4. Mortality Risk - Dose-Response

**Elderly Populations:**

PolSenior Study (80+ years):
- Median IL-6: 2.08 pg/mL
- Highest quartile (≥3.19 pg/mL): 1.9x mortality risk vs lowest (<2.08 pg/mL)
- Hazard ratio: 1.163 per each 1 pg/mL increase

Frail Elderly (mean age 76.3 years):
- Lowest quartile: 7-fold DECREASE in 5-year mortality vs highest quartile
- IL-6 tertiles: ≤1.78 pg/mL, 1.79-3.10 pg/mL, >3.10 pg/mL

**General Risk Estimates:**
- Per log unit increase in IL-6:
  - All-cause mortality: HR 1.35 (1.15-1.59)
  - Cardiovascular death: HR 1.40-1.55
  - MACE: HR 1.14-2.18

---

### 5. IL-6 and Age-Related Conditions

**Sarcopenia (Meta-analysis 2024):**
- Significantly elevated IL-6 in sarcopenic vs non-sarcopenic older adults (SMD = 0.31)
- Inverse correlation with muscle mass (r = -0.18)
- No significant correlation with strength or gait speed

**Frailty:**
- Notable relationship between IL-6 levels and frailty status
- IL-6 component of frailty-associated biomarker panel (with TNF-α, CRP)

**Inflammaging:**
- Chronic low-grade inflammation with aging
- IL-6 central mediator of SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype)
- Not universal across populations (less pronounced in non-industrialized populations)

**Cancer:**
- IL-6 family (including IL-11) implicated in cancer cachexia
- Elevated in multiple cancer types
- IL-11 inhibition extends lifespan 22.5-25% in mice

---

### 6. Can IL-6 Be Too Low?

**Short Answer: NO evidence of harm from low baseline IL-6 in healthy individuals**

**Evidence:**

1. **Healthy Individuals:**
   - IL-6 undetectable (<3 pg/mL) in many healthy volunteers
   - Lowest tercile (median 0.65 pg/mL) shows BEST outcomes
   - No reported immune dysfunction at very low baseline levels

2. **Genetic Evidence:**
   - Carriers of lower IL-6 producing alleles show longevity benefit
   - Mendelian randomization supports causal relationship: lower IL-6 → better outcomes

3. **IL-6 Receptor Deficiency (Different Scenario):**
   - Two patients with IL-6R mutations had recurrent infections BUT:
   - Their baseline IL-6 was ELEVATED (205-830 pg/mL)
   - Problem was inability to RESPOND to IL-6, not low levels
   - This is a receptor deficiency, not low IL-6 production

4. **Physiological Context:**
   - IL-6 surges when needed (infection, tissue damage)
   - Low baseline reflects absence of chronic inflammation (GOOD)
   - Acute response capacity remains intact

**Conclusion:** Very low IL-6 (<1 pg/mL) indicates optimal health, not immune deficiency.

### 7. Clinical Thresholds for Acute Illness (OptimalDX)

**Severe Illness Stratification:**
| Condition | IL-6 Level |
|-----------|-----------|
| Healthy controls | 0-10 pg/mL |
| Severe COVID-19 | 24.3 pg/mL |
| Community pneumonia (no sepsis) | 36.5 pg/mL |
| Community pneumonia with sepsis | 51.4 pg/mL |
| SIRS | 52.6 pg/mL |
| SIRS with sepsis | 75 pg/mL |
| COVID-19 respiratory failure | >80 pg/mL |
| COVID-19 mortality risk | >100 pg/mL |
| SIRS with septic shock | 145 pg/mL |

Note: >35 pg/mL in COVID-19 indicates risk for mechanical ventilation.

## Functional Medicine Interpretation

### Optimal Range for Longevity: <1-2 pg/mL

**Rationale:**
- MESA tercile 1 (0.51-0.78 pg/mL): Lowest mortality
- Centenarian studies: Lower IL-6 producing genotypes favored
- Elderly with successful aging: Lower IL-6 than peers
- No evidence of harm at lowest measurable levels

### Action Thresholds:

**<1 pg/mL (Optimal):**
- Maintain lifestyle factors
- No intervention needed

**1-3 pg/mL (Monitor):**
- Assess inflammaging risk factors
- Optimize diet, exercise, sleep, stress
- Consider anti-inflammatory interventions

**3-5 pg/mL (Moderate Risk):**
- Aggressive lifestyle modification
- Screen for subclinical disease
- Consider targeted supplements (omega-3, curcumin, etc.)

**>5 pg/mL (High Risk):**
- Comprehensive workup for chronic inflammation sources
- Rule out infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy
- Intensive anti-inflammatory protocol
- Cardiovascular risk assessment

**>10 pg/mL (Investigate Acute Illness):**
- Rule out active infection or acute inflammatory process
- May require medical evaluation

## Comparison with hs-CRP

**IL-6 Superior for:**
- Mortality prediction (HR 1.35 vs 1.00 for hs-CRP)
- Cardiovascular death (better discrimination)
- May replace or supplement hs-CRP in future risk models

**Complementary Use:**
- Both elevated: High risk
- IL-6 elevated, hs-CRP normal: Still elevated risk
- IL-6 may be upstream mediator of CRP production

---

## Lifestyle Interventions to Lower IL-6

Based on functional medicine principles:

1. **Exercise:**
   - Regular moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
   - Resistance training for sarcopenia prevention
   - Avoid overtraining (can temporarily increase IL-6)

2. **Diet:**
   - Mediterranean diet pattern
   - Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA)
   - Polyphenol-rich foods
   - Avoid processed foods, excess sugar

3. **Sleep:**
   - 7-9 hours quality sleep
   - Sleep deprivation increases IL-6

4. **Stress Management:**
   - Chronic stress elevates IL-6
   - Meditation, mindfulness practices

5. **Weight Management:**
   - Adipose tissue produces IL-6
   - Weight loss reduces IL-6 in obesity

6. **Supplements (evidence-based):**
   - Omega-3 fatty acids (2-4g/day EPA+DHA)
   - Curcumin (bioavailable forms)
   - Vitamin D (if deficient)
   - Probiotics (gut health)

7. **Avoid:**
   - Smoking
   - Excessive alcohol
   - Sedentary lifestyle
   - Chronic sleep deprivation

### Patient Communication

**For Optimal Levels (<1 pg/mL):**
"Excellent! Your IL-6 level indicates minimal chronic inflammation. This is associated with healthy aging and reduced cardiovascular risk. Continue your current lifestyle."

**For Elevated Levels (>3 pg/mL):**
"Your IL-6 level suggests chronic inflammation (inflammaging). This is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and accelerated aging. Let's work on lifestyle modifications to reduce this."

### Trend Monitoring

- Track IL-6 over time
- Response to interventions (diet, exercise, supplements)
- Correlation with other inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, ESR)
- Integration with cardiovascular risk scores

6. **Central inflammaging biomarker** - Key marker for chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging

7. **Action threshold >3 pg/mL** - Levels above 3 pg/mL warrant investigation and intervention

8. **Critical threshold >10 pg/mL** - May indicate acute illness or severe chronic inflammation
