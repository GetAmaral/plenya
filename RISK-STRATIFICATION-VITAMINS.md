## Executive Summary

This document provides evidence-based risk stratification tables for Vitamin B12 and Vitamin C, integrating functional medicine perspectives with conventional laboratory standards. The stratification focuses on adult populations and incorporates recent literature (2023-2026) emphasizing optimal ranges for disease prevention and neurological protection.

**Key Differences from Conventional Medicine:**
- **Functional medicine** targets higher optimal ranges to prevent subclinical deficiencies and support optimal physiological function
- **Conventional medicine** focuses on preventing overt deficiency diseases (e.g., pernicious anemia, scurvy)
- Japanese and European guidelines for B12 use neurological criteria (500-550 pg/mL) vs. U.S. hematological criteria (200 pg/mL)

## Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

### Clinical Overview

**Biochemical Function:**
- Essential cofactor for methionine synthase (homocysteine → methionine conversion)
- Required for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (L-methylmalonyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA)
- Critical for DNA synthesis, neurological function, and red blood cell formation

**Absorption:**
- Requires intrinsic factor (IF) from gastric parietal cells
- Absorbed in terminal ileum
- Can be depleted by: PPIs, metformin, H. pylori, gastrectomy, ileal disease

**Clinical Applications:**
- Pernicious anemia (autoimmune IF deficiency)
- Metformin-induced deficiency (prevalence: 4.3-41% of users, higher risk at ≥1,500 mg/day or >4 years use)
- Vegan/vegetarian deficiency (no dietary sources in plant foods)
- Neurological protection (peripheral neuropathy, cognitive decline, dementia prevention)
- Methylation support (elevated homocysteine)

**Biomarker Hierarchy (Sensitivity):**
1. **Holotranscobalamin (holoTC/Active B12):** Earliest marker, reflects bioavailable B12
   - Optimal: >70 pmol/L
   - Investigate if <50 pmol/L
   - Deficiency: <35 pmol/L
2. **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA):** Most specific functional marker
   - Normal: <271 nmol/L (0.271 µmol/L)
   - Elevated: >260-271 nmol/L suggests functional B12 deficiency
   - Note: Elevated in renal insufficiency (eGFR <60)
3. **Total Homocysteine:** Sensitive but non-specific (also affected by folate, B6, renal function)
   - Optimal: <10 µmol/L
   - Elevated: >12-15 µmol/L
4. **Serum B12:** Late marker, poor sensitivity for early deficiency
   - Many patients symptomatic with "normal" levels

**Forms of B12 Supplementation:**
- **Cyanocobalamin:** Most stable, requires conversion to active forms
- **Methylcobalamin:** Active form, supports methylation pathways
- **Adenosylcobalamin:** Active form, supports mitochondrial function
- **Hydroxocobalamin:** Longer-acting, used in cyanide poisoning

**Safety:**
- No known toxicity (water-soluble, excess excreted renally)
- No established Upper Limit (UL)

### Units and Conversion

**Primary Units:**
- **pg/mL** (picograms per milliliter) - Common in U.S. labs
- **pmol/L** (picomoles per liter) - SI units, common in Europe/Japan

**Conversion Factor:**
- 1 pg/mL = 0.738 pmol/L
- 1 pmol/L = 1.355 pg/mL

**Example Conversions:**
- 200 pg/mL = 147.6 pmol/L
- 500 pg/mL = 369 pmol/L
- 1000 pg/mL = 738 pmol/L

### Evidence-Based Ranges

**Conventional Laboratory Ranges:**
- U.S. standard: 200-900 pg/mL (147-664 pmol/L) - Based on **hematological** criteria
- Deficiency: <200 pg/mL (<147 pmol/L)

**Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges:**
- **OptimalDX/IFM:** 500-1200 pg/mL (369-886 pmol/L)
- **Japanese/European Guidelines:** Lower limit 500-550 pg/mL (369-406 pmol/L) - Based on **neurological** criteria
- **Neurological Protection:** >1000 pg/mL (>738 pmol/L) for older adults (brain and nervous system health)

**Critical Thresholds:**
- **Neurological symptoms begin:** CSF B12 drops <550 pg/mL
- **Cognitive decline risk:** Levels <400 pmol/L (~540 pg/mL) associated with slower nerve conduction velocity
- **Homocysteine/MMA elevation:** Often occurs <300 pmol/L (~406 pg/mL)

**Recent Research (2024-2025):**
- UCSF study (2025): Cognitive impairment linked to B12 levels within "normal range," suggesting current thresholds insufficient for neurological protection in older adults
- Japanese dementia prevention protocols: Treat levels <500 pg/mL with B12 injections
- Meta-analysis (2024): Higher B12 levels from mid- to late life associated with slower cognitive decline rates

### Risk Stratification Table

| Risk Level | Serum B12 (pg/mL) | Serum B12 (pmol/L) | Clinical Interpretation | Recommendations |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Level 0: Critical Deficiency** | <150 | <111 | Severe deficiency; high risk of megaloblastic anemia, severe neurological damage, irreversible nerve damage if prolonged | **Urgent:** IM/SC B12 injections (1000 µg daily × 1 week, then weekly × 4 weeks). Check MMA, homocysteine, CBC. Investigate etiology (pernicious anemia, malabsorption). Monitor for hypokalemia during repletion. Neurologist referral if symptoms. |
| **Level 1: Severe Deficiency** | 150-199 | 111-147 | Overt deficiency (below conventional lab cutoff); risk of anemia, peripheral neuropathy, glossitis, paresthesias | **Immediate:** IM B12 1000 µg weekly × 4-8 weeks or oral 1000-2000 µg daily. Check MMA, homocysteine. Evaluate for pernicious anemia (anti-IF antibodies), H. pylori, medication review (PPIs, metformin). Consider lifelong supplementation. |
| **Level 2: Moderate-High Risk** | 200-299 | 147-221 | Low-normal by U.S. standards but high risk for subclinical deficiency; functional deficiency likely (elevated MMA/homocysteine common) | **High Priority:** Supplement 1000 µg daily (oral) or IM if malabsorption. Check MMA, homocysteine to confirm functional status. Address risk factors. Monitor neurological symptoms (paresthesias, ataxia, cognitive changes). |
| **Level 3: Moderate Risk** | 300-399 | 221-295 | Suboptimal; may have functional deficiency despite "normal" serum level; neurological symptoms possible | **Moderate Priority:** Supplement 500-1000 µg daily. Check MMA, homocysteine if symptomatic or high-risk (elderly, vegan, metformin use, PPI use). Monitor for improvement. |
| **Level 4: Mild Risk** | 400-499 | 295-369 | Below functional medicine optimal and Japanese/European neurological cutoff; may be insufficient for cognitive protection in older adults | **Consider:** Supplement 500 µg daily, especially if age >60, vegan/vegetarian, on metformin/PPI, or family history of dementia. Check MMA/homocysteine if concerns. Optimize dietary intake (meat, fish, eggs, dairy). |
| **Level 5: Low-Normal** | 500-699 | 369-516 | Meets Japanese/European neurological criteria; lower end of functional medicine optimal range | **Maintain:** Continue adequate dietary intake or maintenance supplementation (250-500 µg daily if risk factors present). Monitor annually if high-risk population. |
| **Level 6: Optimal** | 700-1200 | 516-886 | Optimal range for most adults; supports methylation, neurological function, cardiovascular health | **Optimal:** No supplementation needed unless specific indication. Maintain through diet or low-dose maintenance. Monitor every 2-3 years. |
| **Level 7: High-Normal** | 1201-2000 | 887-1476 | Very high but generally safe; may indicate recent supplementation or injection | **Monitor:** No toxicity concerns. Reduce supplementation if not clinically indicated. Check compliance. Rule out polycythemia vera if very elevated. |
| **Level 8: Very High** | >2000 | >1476 | Markedly elevated; likely from high-dose supplementation or recent injection; rarely pathological | **Investigate:** Review supplement history. Consider discontinuing unless therapeutic indication (e.g., pernicious anemia maintenance). Rule out myeloproliferative disorders if unexplained. No toxicity expected. |

## Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)

### Clinical Overview

**Biochemical Function:**
- Essential cofactor for collagen synthesis (proline/lysine hydroxylation)
- Potent antioxidant (scavenges reactive oxygen species)
- Cofactor for carnitine synthesis
- Enhances non-heme iron absorption
- Required for neurotransmitter synthesis (dopamine → norepinephrine)
- Supports immune function (neutrophil, lymphocyte activity)

**Absorption and Metabolism:**
- Water-soluble, not stored long-term (body pool ~1500 mg)
- Absorbed in small intestine via sodium-dependent transporters (SVCT1)
- Bioavailability decreases at doses >200 mg (saturation kinetics)
- Half-life: ~10-20 days (requires frequent dosing for repletion)
- Renal excretion (osmotic diarrhea at high oral doses >2000 mg)

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Scurvy prevention:** Collagen synthesis, wound healing
- **Antioxidant defense:** Cardiovascular protection, endothelial function
- **Immune support:** Enhanced neutrophil function, reduced infection duration
- **Iron absorption:** Enhances non-heme iron absorption (take with plant-based iron sources)
- **Cardiovascular health:** Endothelial function preservation, reduced inflammation (CRP)
- **High-dose IV-C in sepsis:** Controversial; recent large RCTs failed to replicate early positive results
- **Cancer adjuvant therapy (IV-C):** Emerging evidence; Phase 2 trials show promise (doubled survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer; +5 months in glioblastoma)
- **Wound healing:** Post-surgical, trauma, chronic wounds

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Oral dosing:** Plasma levels peak at 70-80 µM with ~200 mg/day intake
- **IV dosing:** Can achieve pharmacologic levels 1-10 mM (1000-10,000 µM)
- **Tissue saturation:** Requires ~200 mg/day to maintain plasma >50 µmol/L

**Safety:**
- Generally safe (water-soluble, excess excreted)
- **Adverse effects:** Osmotic diarrhea (>2000 mg oral), GI upset
- **Contraindications:** G6PD deficiency (hemolysis risk with high-dose IV-C), kidney stones (oxalate), hemochromatosis (increased iron absorption)
- **Pro-oxidant risk:** At very high doses in presence of free transition metals (rare)

### Units and Conversion

**Primary Units:**
- **mg/dL** (milligrams per deciliter) - Common in U.S. labs
- **µmol/L** (micromoles per liter) - SI units, common internationally

**Conversion Factor:**
- 1 mg/dL = 56.78 µmol/L
- 1 µmol/L = 0.0176 mg/dL

**Example Conversions:**

- **Functional optimal:** 1.0-2.0 mg/dL (57-114 µmol/L)
- **Tissue saturation:** Achieved with ~200 mg/day intake

**Critical Thresholds:**
- **Scurvy:** <0.2 mg/dL (<11 µmol/L) - Overt collagen synthesis defect
- **Hypovitaminosis C:** 0.2-0.4 mg/dL (11-23 µmol/L) - Subclinical deficiency (fatigue, mood changes, impaired immunity)
- **Insufficiency:** 0.4-0.88 mg/dL (23-50 µmol/L) - May have subtle deficits
- **Adequacy:** ≥0.88 mg/dL (≥50 µmol/L) - Meets metabolic demands
- **Cardiovascular protection:** ~0.93 mg/dL (~53 µmol/L) - Greatest CRP reduction

**Recent Research (2023-2024):**
- 2024 systematic review: 27.7% prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in hospitalized adults in high-income countries (severe illness, poor nutrition)
- 48-62% of deficient patients had scurvy
- 2024 Australian study: Older adults, men, low socioeconomic status at higher risk (29.9% insufficient, 24.5% severe deficiency)
- Clinical outcomes: 4.3× increased frailty risk, 2.93× increased cognitive impairment risk
- 2024 cardiovascular meta-analysis: Vitamin C (500-2000 mg/day) improved endothelial function, especially in high-risk patients
- 2024 cancer trials: High-dose IV-C (1.5 g/kg, 2-3×/week) doubled survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer (8→16 months) when added to chemotherapy
