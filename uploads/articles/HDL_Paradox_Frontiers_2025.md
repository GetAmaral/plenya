                                                    models to prospectively assess hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality with
                                                    95% confidence intervals (CIs) over an 11-year baseline period.
                                                    Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.7 years, there were a total of 3,906 deaths
                                                    from all causes, including 2,258 in men and 1,648 in women. The relationship
                                                    between HDL-C and all-cause mortality showed a U-shaped pattern, especially
                                                    in men. Compared to the reference group, the HR (95% CI) for mortality in males
                                                    in the highest HDL cholesterol group was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.01–1.71) after adjusting
                                                    for potential confounding variables. Moreover, low HDL cholesterol showed
                                                    a statistically significant association with increased mortality in both men and

                                                    Conclusion: Extremely high HDL-C levels could paradoxically increase the risk of
                                                    all-cause mortality, particularly among males, in the general population without
