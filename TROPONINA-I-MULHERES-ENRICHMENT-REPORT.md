## Clinical Evidence Highlights

### Sex-Specific 99th Percentile Values
- **Women:** ~16 ng/L (hs-TnI), 11.9 ng/L (hs-TnT)
- **Men:** ~34 ng/L (hs-TnI), 16.8 ng/L (hs-TnT)
- Women have ~50% lower baseline troponin concentrations
- Values are assay-specific (manufacturer-dependent)

### Diagnostic Impact
- **42% increase** in MI detection in women with sex-specific cutoffs
- **6% increase** in MI detection in men
- **83% of reclassified patients** were women
- Addresses historical underdiagnosis of ACS in women

### ESC 2023 Guidelines Position
- Recommend 0h/1h or 0h/2h algorithms with hs-cTn
- Current guidelines use uniform cutoffs (not sex-specific)
- Ongoing debate: simplicity vs. precision
- 4th Universal Definition of MI endorsed sex-specific thresholds

### Treatment Disparities (Critical Issue)
- Despite improved diagnosis, women receive **50% fewer** coronary interventions than men
- Outcomes not improved despite higher detection rates
- Highlights need for systemic change beyond diagnostic thresholds

### Pathophysiological Basis
- Lower left ventricular mass in women
- Reduced beta-adrenergic receptor density
- Higher prevalence of MINOCA (25% of female ACS)
- Different symptom presentations (atypical chest pain)

## Clinical Recommendations

### For Physicians
1. **Consider sex-specific thresholds** (16 ng/L for women) when available
2. **Use ESC 0h/1h algorithm** for rapid rule-out/rule-in
3. **Investigate MINOCA** if cath shows non-obstructive CAD (25% of female ACS)
4. **Address treatment disparities** - ensure equitable intervention access
5. **Document serial values and deltas** for medicolegal protection

### For Laboratory
1. Report sex-specific 99th percentiles when available
2. Ensure assay-specific reference ranges are clearly stated
3. Provide delta calculations on serial samples
4. Flag values using sex-specific interpretation

### For Emergency Medicine
1. **<2 ng/L at 0h:** Safe rule-out with low clinical risk
2. **≥16 ng/L or delta ≥5 ng/L:** Activate ACS protocol
3. **5-16 ng/L:** Observe zone - serial testing required
4. Always correlate with ECG and clinical presentation
