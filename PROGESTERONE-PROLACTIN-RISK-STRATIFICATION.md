**Document Date:** January 2026
**Literature Review Period:** 2023-2026
**Focus:** Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges

## 1. PROGESTERONE (Progesterone)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (Context-Dependent)**

**Rationale:**
- In luteal phase: Low progesterone indicates luteal insufficiency (infertility, PMS, miscarriage risk)
- In pregnancy: Low progesterone associated with miscarriage risk
- In ART cycles: Very high levels (>20 ng/mL at transfer) associated with decreased pregnancy success
- Overall pattern shows risks at both low and excessively high levels in reproductive contexts

### Primary Unit: **ng/mL**
**Conversions:**
- 1 ng/mL = 3.18 nmol/L
- 1 nmol/L = 0.315 ng/mL

---

### Context 1: Women - Follicular Phase

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical High** | >2.0 | >6.4 | Abnormal; suggests premature luteinization or testing error |
| **Suboptimal High** | 1.0-2.0 | 3.2-6.4 | Elevated; may indicate anovulation or PCOS |
| **Optimal** | 0.1-0.7 | 0.3-2.2 | Normal follicular phase |
| **Borderline Low** | <0.1 | <0.3 | Very low; unusual but not necessarily pathological |

**Notes:**
- Progesterone should remain low during follicular phase
- Elevated levels suggest ovulation has occurred or hormonal dysfunction
- Testing typically performed days 2-5 of cycle

---

### Context 2: Women - Luteal Phase (MOST IMPORTANT)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <3.0 | <9.5 | Severe luteal insufficiency; anovulation likely |
| **High Risk** | 3.0-5.0 | 9.5-15.9 | Luteal phase deficiency; infertility risk, PMS symptoms |
| **Suboptimal** | 5.0-10.0 | 15.9-31.8 | Borderline; ovulation confirmed but suboptimal corpus luteum function |
| **Optimal** | 10.0-25.0 | 31.8-79.5 | Healthy ovulation; adequate corpus luteum function |
| **High Normal** | 25.0-30.0 | 79.5-95.4 | Upper normal; generally healthy |
| **Elevated** | >30.0 | >95.4 | Unusually high; consider PCOS, testing error, or pregnancy |

**Notes:**
- Testing typically performed ~7 days post-ovulation (day 21 of 28-day cycle)
- P4 ≥10 ng/mL confirms ovulation and adequate luteal function
- P4:E2 ratio >100:1 optimal for conception
- For clomiphene cycles, optimal threshold is >15 ng/mL
- Levels vary with pulsatile secretion; single measurement has limitations

---

### Context 3: Women - Pregnancy (First Trimester)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <5.0 | <15.9 | High miscarriage risk; non-viable pregnancy likely |
| **High Risk** | 5.0-10.0 | 15.9-31.8 | Threatened miscarriage; close monitoring required |
| **Suboptimal** | 10.0-15.0 | 31.8-47.7 | Borderline; consider progesterone supplementation |
| **Optimal** | 15.0-44.0 | 47.7-140.0 | Healthy early pregnancy |
| **High Normal** | 44.0-60.0 | 140.0-191.0 | Upper normal range |

**Notes:**
- Progesterone <10 ng/mL: 66.5% sensitivity, 96.3% specificity for non-viable pregnancy
- Progesterone <12 ng/mL can predict miscarriage in threatened miscarriage cases
- Overlap exists between viable and non-viable pregnancies
- Levels rise progressively through first trimester

---

### Context 4: Women - Pregnancy (Second Trimester)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <17.0 | <54.0 | Significantly below normal; urgent evaluation |
| **Suboptimal** | 17.0-25.0 | 54.0-79.5 | Below optimal; monitor closely |
| **Optimal** | 25.0-83.0 | 79.5-264.0 | Healthy mid-pregnancy range |
| **High Normal** | 83.0-146.0 | 264.0-464.0 | Upper normal range |

**Notes:**
- Progesterone levels continue to rise as pregnancy progresses
- Produced by placenta after first trimester
- Levels support uterine quiescence and prevent preterm labor

---

### Context 5: Women - Pregnancy (Third Trimester)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <55.0 | <175.0 | Below normal; evaluate placental function |
| **Suboptimal** | 55.0-80.0 | 175.0-254.4 | Lower end of normal; monitor |
| **Optimal** | 80.0-200.0 | 254.4-636.0 | Healthy late pregnancy range |
| **High Normal** | 200.0-250.0 | 636.0-795.0 | Upper normal range; approaching term |

**Notes:**
- Peak progesterone levels occur in third trimester
- Maintains pregnancy and prepares for lactation
- Levels drop sharply after delivery (placental separation)

---

### Context 6: Women - Post-Menopause

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Optimal** | <0.2 | <0.6 | Normal postmenopausal (ovaries inactive) |
| **Borderline** | 0.2-0.5 | 0.6-1.6 | Slightly elevated; usually benign |
| **Elevated** | 0.5-1.3 | 1.6-4.1 | Mildly elevated; investigate if symptomatic |
| **Abnormal High** | >1.3 | >4.1 | Abnormal; rule out HRT, adrenal source, or pathology |

**Notes:**
- Progesterone production ceases with ovarian senescence
- Levels typically undetectable or very low
- Elevated levels may indicate exogenous hormone use or adrenal source
- P4:E2 ratio relevant for metabolic/cardiovascular risk assessment

---

### Context 7: Men

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Optimal** | <0.5 | <1.6 | Normal male range |
| **Borderline** | 0.5-1.0 | 1.6-3.2 | Slightly elevated; usually benign |
| **Elevated** | 1.0-1.6 | 3.2-5.1 | Mildly elevated; investigate if symptomatic |
| **Abnormal High** | >1.6 | >5.1 | Abnormal; rule out adrenal pathology or medications |

**Notes:**
- Men produce small amounts of progesterone from adrenal glands and testes
- Progesterone can inhibit aromatase conversion of testosterone to estrogen
- Optimal testosterone:estradiol ratio: 10-30 (T in ng/dL / E2 in pg/mL)
- Elevated progesterone may indicate adrenal hyperplasia or CAH

---

### Special Considerations for Progesterone

1. **Timing is Critical:** Results meaningless without proper cycle timing
2. **Pulsatile Secretion:** Single measurements have limitations due to hormone pulses
3. **Laboratory Variability:** Reference ranges vary by assay method
4. **Corpus Luteum Function:** Luteal phase levels directly reflect ovarian function
5. **ART Considerations:** In frozen embryo transfer, levels >20 ng/mL at transfer associated with lower success rates
6. **Supplementation:** Vaginal progesterone preferred for luteal support (fewer side effects than IM)

---

## 2. PROLACTIN (Prolactin - RIE with Dilution)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

**Rationale:**
- Low prolactin (<5-7 ng/mL): Associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, sexual dysfunction, fertility problems
- Mildly elevated (25-100 ng/mL): May be protective ("HomeoFIT-PRL" range)
- High prolactin (>25 ng/mL women, >20 ng/mL men): Hyperprolactinemia with reproductive/endocrine dysfunction
- Very high (>100 ng/mL): Likely prolactinoma or severe pathology

### Primary Unit: **ng/mL**
**Conversions:**
- 1 ng/mL = 1 µg/L
- 1 ng/mL = 21.2 mIU/L (approx 21 µIU/L)
- 1 mIU/L = 0.047 ng/mL

---

### Risk Stratification: Women (Non-Pregnant)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (mIU/L) | Range (µg/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <3.0 | <64 | <3.0 | Severe hypoprolactinemia; pituitary dysfunction, metabolic syndrome risk |
| **Low Risk** | 3.0-5.0 | 64-106 | 3.0-5.0 | Hypoprolactinemia; insulin resistance, sexual dysfunction, infertility risk |
| **Suboptimal** | 5.0-7.0 | 106-148 | 5.0-7.0 | Below optimal; monitor metabolic health |
| **Optimal** | 7.0-20.0 | 148-424 | 7.0-20.0 | Healthy range; metabolically protective |
| **HomeoFIT-PRL** | 20.0-25.0 | 424-530 | 20.0-25.0 | Adaptive elevation; may be metabolically beneficial in obesity/PCOS |
| **Mild Hyperprolactinemia** | 25.0-50.0 | 530-1060 | 25.0-50.0 | Investigate causes; check for macroprolactinemia; may need MRI |
| **Moderate Hyperprolactinemia** | 50.0-100.0 | 1060-2120 | 50.0-100.0 | Likely microadenoma; dopamine agonist treatment usually indicated |
| **Severe Hyperprolactinemia** | 100.0-250.0 | 2120-5300 | 100.0-250.0 | Likely macroadenoma; MRI required; medical treatment |
| **Critical High** | >250.0 | >5300 | >250.0 | Giant prolactinoma or severe pathology; urgent endocrinology referral |

**Notes:**
- Upper normal limit: 15-25 ng/mL (varies by lab)
- Basal levels average 13 ng/mL in women
- Reference range: 2-29 ng/mL (non-pregnant, non-lactating)

---

### Risk Stratification: Men

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (mIU/L) | Range (µg/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <2.0 | <42 | <2.0 | Severe hypoprolactinemia; pituitary dysfunction, metabolic syndrome risk |
| **Low Risk** | 2.0-5.0 | 42-106 | 2.0-5.0 | Hypoprolactinemia; insulin resistance, sexual dysfunction, low libido |
| **Optimal** | 5.0-15.0 | 106-318 | 5.0-15.0 | Healthy male range; metabolically protective |
| **Borderline** | 15.0-20.0 | 318-424 | 15.0-20.0 | Upper normal; investigate if symptomatic |
| **Mild Hyperprolactinemia** | 20.0-50.0 | 424-1060 | 20.0-50.0 | Hyperprolactinemia; check for macroprolactinemia; evaluate causes |
| **Moderate Hyperprolactinemia** | 50.0-100.0 | 1060-2120 | 50.0-100.0 | Likely microadenoma; erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia common |
| **Severe Hyperprolactinemia** | 100.0-250.0 | 2120-5300 | 100.0-250.0 | Likely macroadenoma; MRI required; testosterone suppression |
| **Critical High** | >250.0 | >5300 | >250.0 | Giant prolactinoma or severe pathology; urgent evaluation |

**Notes:**
- Upper normal limit: 15-20 ng/mL
- Basal levels average 5 ng/mL in men
- Reference range: 2-18 ng/mL
- Minimum threshold for normal reserve: 5 ng/mL (basal)

---

### Risk Stratification: Pregnancy (Third Trimester)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | Range (mIU/L) | Clinical Significance |
|------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Low** | <10.0 | <212 | Below expected; evaluate pituitary function |
| **Suboptimal** | 10.0-50.0 | 212-1060 | Lower range; monitor |
| **Optimal** | 50.0-209.0 | 1060-4431 | Normal pregnancy range |
| **High Normal** | 209.0-400.0 | 4431-8480 | Upper normal; physiological in late pregnancy |

**Notes:**
- Prolactin rises progressively throughout pregnancy
- Peak levels at term prepare mammary glands for lactation
- Postpartum prolactin surges with breastfeeding (can reach >400 ng/mL)

### Special Considerations for Prolactin

#### 1. Macroprolactinemia
- **Definition:** High molecular weight, biologically inactive prolactin (PRL-IgG complex)
- **Prevalence:** 10-25% of patients with hyperprolactinemia; 3.7% general population
- **Clinical Impact:** FALSE positive hyperprolactinemia; patients usually asymptomatic
- **Testing:** PEG (polyethylene glycol) precipitation test
  - **<40% recovery:** Macroprolactinemia present
  - **>60% recovery:** Macroprolactinemia absent
  - **40-60%:** Indeterminate; consider gel filtration chromatography
- **Management:** No treatment needed; avoid unnecessary workup and medications

#### 2. Causes of Hyperprolactinemia
- **Physiological:** Pregnancy, lactation, stress, exercise, sleep, nipple stimulation
- **Medications:** Antipsychotics (risperidone, haloperidol), metoclopramide, domperidone, SSRIs, opioids
- **Pathological:** Prolactinoma (micro/macroadenoma), hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, PCOS
- **Pituitary stalk effect:** Non-functioning adenomas compressing stalk (usually PRL <100 ng/mL)

#### 3. Hypoprolactinemia and Metabolic Health
- **U-Shaped Relationship:** Both low and high prolactin associated with metabolic dysfunction
- **Low PRL Associations:** Type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, fatty liver, dyslipidemia, obesity, sexual dysfunction
- **Protective Range:** Moderate prolactin levels (7-25 ng/mL) appear metabolically protective
- **HomeoFIT-PRL (25-100 ng/mL):** May represent adaptive response in obesity/metabolic stress
- **Clinical Implication:** Avoid excessive dopamine agonist suppression (target >5-7 ng/mL)

#### 4. Gender Differences
- **Women:** Higher basal levels (average 13 ng/mL vs 5 ng/mL in men)
- **Men:** More sensitive to hyperprolactinemia effects (sexual dysfunction at lower levels)
- **Thresholds:** Gender-specific cutoffs for microadenoma prediction

#### 5. Diagnostic Considerations
- **Timing:** Morning fasting sample preferred; avoid stress/exercise before testing
- **Macroprolactin Screening:** Always perform PEG precipitation if PRL >25 ng/mL without symptoms
- **Dilution Test (Hook Effect):** For PRL >200 ng/mL, perform 1:100 dilution to exclude giant prolactinomas
- **MRI Indication:** PRL >50 ng/mL warrants pituitary MRI (unless macroprolactinemia confirmed)
- **TRH Stimulation:** Can diagnose hypoprolactinemia (peak response <18 ng/mL men, <41 ng/mL women)

#### 6. Treatment Targets
- **Hyperprolactinemia:** Normalize PRL to <20 ng/mL (women), <15 ng/mL (men)
- **Caution:** Avoid over-suppression below 5-7 ng/mL (metabolic consequences)
- **Fertility:** Target mid-normal range for optimal reproductive function
- **Dopamine Agonists:** Cabergoline preferred (better efficacy, tolerability vs bromocriptine)

## Clinical Implementation Notes

### For Functional Medicine Practice:

1. **Context Matters:** Always interpret results based on patient's reproductive status, cycle phase, pregnancy status, and gender
2. **Patterns Over Single Points:** Track trends over time rather than relying on single measurements
3. **Metabolic Integration:** Consider prolactin's metabolic role beyond reproduction
4. **Avoid Over-Treatment:** Especially with macroprolactinemia and adaptive mild elevations
5. **Personalized Targets:** Adjust optimal ranges based on individual patient goals (fertility vs metabolic health)

### Quality Control:

1. **Standardize Timing:** Morning fasting samples, minimize stress
2. **Screen for Macroprolactin:** Always perform PEG test if prolactin >25 ng/mL without symptoms
3. **Dilution Protocol:** For prolactin >200 ng/mL, perform 1:100 dilution to exclude hook effect
4. **Laboratory Variation:** Confirm reference ranges specific to assay method used
