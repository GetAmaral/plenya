  - <1: Acute viral hepatitis or NAFLD
- Myocardial infarction timeline (6-8h rise, 24-36h peak, 3-7d normalization)
- Prognostic value (≥40 U/L reduces life expectancy by 10 years)

- **Journal:** Clinical Biochemist Reviews
- **Type:** Review
- **Date:** November 2013
- **Authors:** Botros M, Sikaris KA

**Key Findings:**
- AST cleared twice as fast as ALT (t½ 18h vs 36h)
- Ratio interpretation:
  - <1.0: Acute viral hepatitis
  - >1.5: Alcoholic hepatitis

**Key Findings:**
- Case of isolated elevated AST in asymptomatic young patient
- Diagnosed with macro-AST via PEG precipitation testing
- Macro-AST is "a benign condition that may be considered pathologic by clinicians"
- Important differential diagnosis for persistent AST elevation

## Clinical Focus Areas

### AST Reference Ranges
- **Normal:** 10-40 U/L
- **Mild elevation:** 41-100 U/L
- **Moderate elevation:** 101-500 U/L
- **Marked elevation:** 501-1000 U/L
- **Severe elevation:** >1000 U/L

### AST/ALT Ratio (De Ritis Ratio)
- **>2.0:** Suggests alcoholic liver disease (92% sensitivity in ALD)
- **>1.0:** Suggests cirrhosis in chronic hepatopathy
- **<1.0:** Typical of acute viral hepatitis or NAFLD
- **≥2.0 in STEMI:** Predicts total coronary occlusion

### Clinical Applications
1. **Liver Disease:**
   - Differentiate alcoholic vs non-alcoholic liver disease
   - Predict fibrosis/cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis
   - Monitor hepatotoxicity

2. **Cardiovascular Disease:**
   - Myocardial infarction biomarker (less specific than troponin)
   - Predict coronary occlusion severity
   - Prognostic marker for CV mortality

3. **Muscle Disorders:**
   - Rhabdomyolysis detection
   - Exercise-induced elevation
   - Dermatomyositis/polymyositis

4. **Differential Diagnosis:**
   - Macro-AST (benign)
   - Hemolysis
   - Thyroid disease

### Future Updates
- Monitor for new AST research articles (2024-2026)
- Add articles on AST in specific populations (elderly, pregnancy)
- Consider adding lecture/protocol type articles for educational value
