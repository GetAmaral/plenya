### Clinical Conduct (2,970 chars)
Detailed 4-tier risk stratification protocol:

**Tier 1: Normal (0.42-12.32 ng/mL in BMI 20-25)**
- Annual preventive monitoring
- Lifestyle reinforcement: Mediterranean/DASH diet, 150min/week aerobic + 2x/week resistance
- Sleep hygiene (7-9h)

**Tier 2: Mild-Moderate Elevation (12.32-24 ng/mL)**
- Early leptin resistance
- Behavioral intervention: 5-10% weight loss in 6 months
- Moderate caloric deficit (500kcal/day)
- High-protein diet (1.6-2g/kg), high-fiber (>30g/day)
- Exercise: 200min/week aerobic + 3x/week resistance
- Supplements: omega-3 (2-3g/day), vitamin D (>30ng/mL), magnesium
- Re-evaluate in 3 months

**Tier 3: Moderate-High Elevation (24-50 ng/mL)**
- Established leptin resistance with high metabolic risk
- Endocrinology referral
- Comprehensive workup: metabolic syndrome criteria, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, sleep apnea, thyroid function
- Goal: 10-15% weight loss
- Consider supervised low-carb ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting 16:8
- Pharmacotherapy if BMI>30 or BMI>27 with comorbidities:
  - Metformin 1500-2000mg/day
  - GLP-1 analogs (liraglutide/semaglutide) in selected cases
- If testosterone <300ng/dL with symptoms: consider HRT after weight loss (often normalizes with weight reduction)

**Tier 4: Very High (>50 ng/mL)**
- Severe obesity with grave leptin resistance
- Multidisciplinary team: endocrinologist, dietitian, psychologist, exercise physiologist
- Investigate secondary causes: Cushing's, hypothyroidism, medications
- Bariatric surgery candidacy if BMI>40 or BMI>35 with severe comorbidities
- Rigorous cardiovascular monitoring: ECG, echocardiogram, stress test
- Complications screening: nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy
- Aggressive pharmacotherapy: metformin + GLP-1 analog
- Psychological support for sustainable behavioral change

**Monitoring Protocol:**
- Re-assess leptin, HOMA-IR, metabolic profile, testosterone every 3-6 months during active intervention
- After stabilization: semi-annual/annual follow-up
- Adjust based on clinical and laboratory evolution

## Key Clinical Insights

### Male-Specific Leptin Physiology
1. **Sex Dimorphism:** Men naturally have ~3x lower leptin than women (6.45 vs 20.92 ng/mL) due to lower adiposity and hormonal influences
2. **Testosterone Interaction:** Hyperleptinemia → HPG axis disruption + direct Leydig cell inhibition → reduced testosterone
3. **Metabolic Correlations:** In men specifically, leptin correlates with BMI, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and uric acid

### Leptin Resistance "Triple Defect"
1. **BBB Transport:** Saturated leptin transporters prevent CNS entry
2. **Receptor Signaling:** SOCS3 activation inhibits leptin receptor signaling
3. **Central/Peripheral:** Hypothalamic and peripheral tissue resistance

### Clinical Implications
- **Cardiovascular Risk:** Leptin independently predicts CVD events in men, particularly with acute MI
- **Metabolic Syndrome:** Optimal cut-off 24.1-28.9 ng/mL for syndrome, obesity, T2DM
- **Obesity-Induced Hypogonadism:** Weight loss often restores testosterone without HRT
