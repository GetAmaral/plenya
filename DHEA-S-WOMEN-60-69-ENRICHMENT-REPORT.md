**Interpretation of Results:**
- Reference ranges for women 60-69 years (12-154 µg/dL)
- Significant deficiency threshold (<30 µg/dL)
- Age-specific interpretation considerations

**Complementary Assessment:**
- Simultaneous hormonal evaluation (estradiol, testosterone, SHBG)
- Bone densitometry (DEXA) mandatory when DHEA-S is low
- Muscle strength evaluation (hand grip dynamometry, functional tests)

**Supplementation Indications:**
- Evidence-based dosing: 50mg/day minimum
- Duration: minimum 26 weeks for optimal benefits
- Established indications: adrenal insufficiency, osteoporosis/osteopenia with low DHEA-S, confirmed sarcopenia, chronic glucocorticoid use
- Multimodal approach: resistance exercises, calcium (1000-1200mg/day), vitamin D3 (1000IU/day)

**Monitoring and Precautions:**
- Laboratory monitoring schedule (DHEA-S, estradiol, liver function)
- Endometrial surveillance (transvaginal ultrasound if bleeding)
- Contraindications: active hormone-dependent cancer, severe liver disease
- Possible side effects: acne, mild hirsutism, voice deepening
- No evidence for cardiovascular prevention

## Key Clinical Takeaways

1. **Diagnostic Value:** DHEA-S is crucial for assessing hormonal status in postmenopausal women 60-69 years, particularly those with frailty, sarcopenia, or osteoporosis.

2. **Evidence-Based Thresholds:** Levels <30 µg/dL warrant clinical investigation; <15 µg/dL requires adrenal function assessment.

3. **Musculoskeletal Benefits:** Strong evidence supports DHEA's role in preserving muscle strength, function, and bone mass in elderly women.

4. **Supplementation Protocol:** When indicated, 50mg/day for minimum 26 weeks, always combined with resistance exercise, calcium, and vitamin D3.

5. **Cardiovascular Caution:** No evidence supports cardiovascular benefits; indication should focus on musculoskeletal health.

6. **Multimodal Approach:** DHEA supplementation should be part of comprehensive intervention including exercise and nutritional support.
