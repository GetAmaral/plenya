# Cardiac Biomarkers Risk Stratification for Functional Integrative Medicine

**Date:** January 2026
**Focus:** NT-proBNP and hs-CRP for cardiovascular risk assessment in functional medicine

---

## 1. NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR (Higher is Worse)**

NT-proBNP demonstrates a **linear relationship** with cardiovascular outcomes. Research shows each doubling in NT-proBNP is associated with a 37% relative increase in cardiovascular events (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.34-1.41). There is **no evidence of a U-shaped curve** - higher levels consistently indicate worse cardiovascular risk.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine Perspective)

**Primary Unit:** pg/mL

**Optimal for Prevention:**
- **<125 pg/mL** - Ideal range for primary prevention and cardiovascular health
- This threshold has 94.6% sensitivity for ruling out heart failure
- Recommended by ESC, Heart Failure Society of America, and Japanese Heart Failure Society for defining Stage B heart failure risk

**Age-Specific Reference Ranges (Healthy Population):**

| Age Group | Males (Median) | Males (97.5th percentile) | Females (Median) | Females (97.5th percentile) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| <30 years | 21 pg/mL | 104 pg/mL | 51 pg/mL | 196 pg/mL |
| 50-59 years | 38 pg/mL | 195 pg/mL | 66 pg/mL | 299 pg/mL |
| ≥80 years | 281 pg/mL | 6792 pg/mL | 240 pg/mL | 2704 pg/mL |

### Risk Stratification Levels (6 Levels - Age <50 years)

| Risk Level | NT-proBNP (pg/mL) | Clinical Interpretation | Action |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **1. Optimal** | <50 | Excellent cardiovascular health | Maintain lifestyle |
| **2. Low Risk** | 50-124 | Normal, low cardiovascular risk | Continue preventive measures |
| **3. Borderline** | 125-299 | Early elevation, monitor closely | Lifestyle optimization, consider risk factors |
| **4. Moderate Risk** | 300-449 | Moderate cardiovascular risk | Medical evaluation recommended |
| **5. High Risk** | 450-1800 | High cardiovascular risk | Cardiology referral, treat as CVD equivalent |
| **6. Very High Risk** | >1800 | Very high risk/probable heart failure | Urgent cardiology referral (within 2 weeks) |

### Risk Stratification Levels - Age-Adjusted Thresholds

**Age 50-75 years:**

| Risk Level | NT-proBNP (pg/mL) | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Optimal** | <75 | Excellent cardiovascular health |
| **2. Low Risk** | 75-249 | Normal for age, low cardiovascular risk |
| **3. Borderline** | 250-449 | Early elevation, monitor |
| **4. Moderate Risk** | 450-899 | Moderate cardiovascular risk |
| **5. High Risk** | 900-2000 | High cardiovascular risk |
| **6. Very High Risk** | >2000 | Very high risk/probable heart failure |

**Age >75 years:**

| Risk Level | NT-proBNP (pg/mL) | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Optimal** | <125 | Excellent cardiovascular health |
| **2. Low Risk** | 125-499 | Normal for age, low cardiovascular risk |
| **3. Borderline** | 500-899 | Early elevation, monitor |
| **4. Moderate Risk** | 900-1799 | Moderate cardiovascular risk |
| **5. High Risk** | 1800-4000 | High cardiovascular risk |
| **6. Very High Risk** | >4000 | Very high risk/probable heart failure |

- [Choosing Cut-offs for NT-proBNP](https://acutecaretesting.org/en/articles/choosing-cut-offs-for-nt-probnp)

### Key Clinical Thresholds by Application

**Rule-Out Heart Failure (High Sensitivity):**
- <125 pg/mL (all ages) - Rules out heart failure with >95% negative predictive value
- <300 pg/mL (acute presentations) - >90% sensitivity for ruling out acute HF

**Rule-In Heart Failure (Age-Specific):**
- ≥450 pg/mL (age <50)
- ≥900 pg/mL (age 50-75)
- ≥1800 pg/mL (age >75)

**CVD Risk Equivalent:**
- ≥450 pg/mL - Associated with 2.12x higher all-cause mortality, 2.92x cardiovascular mortality, 2.59x incident CVD, 3.81x heart failure
- Should be managed as if patient has existing CVD

**Source:** [NT-proBNP as CVD Risk Equivalent - ARIC Study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10208080/)

### Important Considerations

**Age Dependency:** NT-proBNP increases significantly with age. Always use age-adjusted cutoffs for accurate interpretation.

**Sex Differences:** Women have higher NT-proBNP levels than men at younger ages, but this difference diminishes after age 50.

**BMI Effect:** Obesity is associated with lower NT-proBNP levels. Consider BMI-adjusted cutoffs in obese patients.

**Renal Function:** NT-proBNP is cleared by kidneys. Levels increase significantly with declining eGFR.

**Clinical Context:** Atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and right ventricular strain can elevate NT-proBNP independent of left ventricular dysfunction.

### Unit Conversions

- **Primary unit:** pg/mL
- **Alternative:** pmol/L
- **Conversion:** 1 ng/L = 1 pg/mL = 0.118 pmol/L

## 2. hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR (Higher is Worse)**

hs-CRP demonstrates a **linear, dose-dependent relationship** with cardiovascular risk and mortality. Research shows the risk is fairly linear across a wide range of CRP levels, with crude relative risks increasing progressively from 1.0 at <0.5 mg/L to 7.6 at ≥20.0 mg/L. There is **no U-shaped curve** - higher levels consistently indicate worse outcomes.

- [ACC 2025: hsCRP as Risk Assessment Tool](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2025/12/01/01/prioritizing-health-hscrp)

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine Perspective)

**Primary Unit:** mg/L

**Optimal for Health and Longevity:**
- **<0.55 mg/L** (men) / **<1.0 mg/L** (women) - Ideal functional medicine range
- **<1.0 mg/L** - Low inflammation, lowest cardiovascular risk, optimal for longevity
- Functional medicine practitioners target these stricter levels compared to conventional medicine

### Risk Stratification Levels (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | hs-CRP (mg/L) | Clinical Interpretation | Cardiovascular Risk | Action |
|------------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **1. Optimal** | <0.5 | Excellent, minimal inflammation | Lowest risk (RR: 1.0) | Maintain lifestyle |
| **2. Good** | 0.5-0.99 | Good, low inflammation | Low risk (RR: 2.2) | Continue preventive measures |
| **3. Borderline** | 1.0-1.99 | Mild inflammation, monitor | Moderate-low risk (RR: 2.5) | Lifestyle optimization |
| **4. Moderate Risk** | 2.0-2.99 | Moderate inflammation | Moderate-high risk (RR: 3.1) | Anti-inflammatory interventions |
| **5. High Risk** | 3.0-9.99 | High chronic inflammation | High risk (RR: 3.7-4.9) | Medical evaluation, aggressive treatment |
| **6. Very High Risk** | ≥10.0 | Very high inflammation | Very high risk (RR: 6.3+) | Rule out acute infection, retest in 2 weeks |

**Source:** [Clinical Usefulness of CRP - Detailed Risk Levels](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.0000125690.80303.a8)

### Standard AHA/CDC Cardiovascular Risk Categories (3 Levels)

| Risk Category | hs-CRP (mg/L) | Interpretation |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Low Risk** | <1.0 | Low cardiovascular risk |
| **Moderate Risk** | 1.0-3.0 | Moderate cardiovascular risk |
| **High Risk** | >3.0 | High cardiovascular risk |

**Note:** For residual inflammatory risk assessment in patients on statin therapy, a cutoff of **≥2.0 mg/L** is often used to identify persistent inflammation requiring anti-inflammatory therapy.

**Source:** [High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein in ASCVD](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11959579/)

### Very High hs-CRP (>10 mg/L): Acute vs. Chronic

**>10 mg/L typically indicates ACUTE INFLAMMATION:**
- Acute infection (bacterial or viral)
- Recent trauma or surgery (including dental work)
- Acute injury
- Systemic vasculitis
- Major trauma

**Clinical Recommendation:**
- CDC/AHA guidelines: Repeat hs-CRP test **twice, 2 weeks apart** in patients free of infection or acute illness
- Values consistently >10 mg/L without acute cause may indicate chronic inflammatory condition (autoimmune disease, cancer, etc.)
- For cardiovascular risk assessment, hs-CRP >10 mg/L is **not interpretable** - retest after acute process resolves

- [GrassrootsHealth: High hsCRP Interpretation](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/high-hscrp-level-mean-might-cause-concern/)

### Recent Evidence (2024-2025)

**Predictive Value:**
- In 31,245 statin-treated patients (PROMINENT, REDUCE-IT, STRENGTH trials), **hs-CRP was a stronger predictor of recurrent MI, stroke, and CV death than LDL cholesterol**
- Single baseline hs-CRP measurement predictive of CV events over **30-year period** in healthy women

- [30-Year CV Outcomes in Women - NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2405182)

**Longevity and Biological Aging:**
- hs-CRP >3 mg/L associated with **8.74 years increase in biological age** in adults with prediabetes/diabetes
- Even minimally elevated hs-CRP (median 6.41 mg/L) shows significant legacy effects on long-term cardiovascular outcomes
- Maintaining hs-CRP <1 mg/L associated with improved longevity and reduced cardiovascular disease risk

### Important Considerations

**Not Age-Dependent:** Unlike NT-proBNP, hs-CRP cutoffs do not require age adjustment.

**Timing:** Can be measured fasting or non-fasting for cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Stability:** CRP levels can fluctuate. For accurate cardiovascular risk assessment, obtain 2 measurements and average them.

**Acute Inflammation:** Always rule out acute infection, trauma, or illness before interpreting for cardiovascular risk.

**Clinical Context:** Chronic inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, IBD) will elevate hs-CRP independent of cardiovascular risk.

**Lifestyle Factors:** Obesity, smoking, insulin resistance, diabetes, and high triglycerides all increase hs-CRP.

### Unit Conversions

- **Primary unit:** mg/L
- **Alternative:** mg/dL
- **Conversion:** 1 mg/L = 0.1 mg/dL = 10 mg/L per 1 mg/dL
- **Example:** 1 mg/L = 0.1 mg/dL; 10 mg/L = 1 mg/dL

## Clinical Implementation for Plenya EMR

### Database Structure Recommendations

**lab_results table:**
- Store values in primary units (pg/mL for NT-proBNP, mg/L for hs-CRP)
- Include patient age at time of test for NT-proBNP interpretation
- Flag acute inflammation (hs-CRP >10 mg/L) for retest recommendation
- Store risk level calculation (1-6) based on age-adjusted algorithms

**health_scores table:**
- Calculate cardiovascular risk score incorporating both biomarkers
- Weight NT-proBNP more heavily (stronger predictor)
- Invalidate hs-CRP contribution if >10 mg/L (acute inflammation)
- Provide age-adjusted risk stratification

### Risk Stratification Algorithm

```
For NT-proBNP:
1. Determine patient age at test date
2. Apply age-specific thresholds (<50, 50-75, >75)
3. Assign risk level 1-6
4. Flag if ≥450 pg/mL (CVD risk equivalent)

For hs-CRP:
1. Check if >10 mg/L → Flag for retest (acute inflammation)
2. If <10 mg/L, assign risk level 1-6
3. If 2 measurements available, use average
4. Flag if ≥2 mg/L on statin therapy (residual inflammatory risk)
```

### Clinical Alerts

**NT-proBNP:**
- ≥125 pg/mL: "Consider cardiovascular evaluation"
- ≥450 pg/mL: "High cardiovascular risk - treat as CVD equivalent"
- ≥1800 pg/mL (>75y) or ≥450 pg/mL (<50y): "Urgent cardiology referral recommended"

**hs-CRP:**
- ≥1.0 mg/L: "Mild inflammation - consider lifestyle modifications"
- ≥2.0 mg/L: "Moderate inflammation - anti-inflammatory interventions recommended"
- ≥3.0 mg/L: "High cardiovascular risk - medical evaluation recommended"
- ≥10.0 mg/L: "Possible acute inflammation - retest in 2 weeks after resolving acute illness"
