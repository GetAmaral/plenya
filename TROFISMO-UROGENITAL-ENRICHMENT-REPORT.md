## Key Assessment Tools Documented

### Vaginal Health Index (VHI)
Five parameters evaluated:
1. Vaginal elasticity
2. Vaginal secretions
3. pH level
4. Epithelial mucous membrane integrity
5. Vaginal hydration

**Scoring:** Lower scores indicate greater atrophy

### Vulvar Health Index
Evaluates:
- Labia
- Urethra
- Clitoris
- Introitus
- Elasticity
- Pain during intercourse

**Scoring:** Higher scores indicate greater degree of vulvar atrophy

---

## Clinical Terminology

**Primary Terms:**
- Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) - Current preferred terminology (2014)
- Vulvovaginal Atrophy (VVA) - Historical term
- Atrophic Vaginitis - Outdated term

**Prevalence:** 27-84% of postmenopausal women (underdiagnosed and undertreated)

---

## Treatment Hierarchy (Evidence-Based)

### Tier 1: First-Line (All Patients)
- Vaginal moisturizers

- Can be used alone or with other therapies

### Tier 2: Hormonal (Strongest Evidence)
- **Local low-dose vaginal estrogen** (most robust evidence)
  - Improves: dryness, irritation, dyspareunia
  - Forms: creams, suppositories, rings, tablets
- **Vaginal DHEA (prasterona)**
  - Effective for dryness and dyspareunia
- **Oral ospemifene** (SERM)

### Tier 3: Systemic
- Hormone therapy (for concurrent vasomotor symptoms)

### Tier 4: Emerging
- Pelvic floor physical therapy
- Fractional CO2 laser
- Radiofrequency
- Vaginal injections
- *Note: Variable efficacy data, need further research*

### Special Population: Breast Cancer
