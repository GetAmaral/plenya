## Clinical Content Summary

### Clinical Relevance (PT-BR)
Comprehensive overview covering:
- IgM as first-line immune defense and primary antibody response
- Pentameric structure with 10 antigen-binding sites and J chain
- Molecular weight >900 kDa with 5-10 day half-life
- Reference ranges: 40-230 mg/dL (adults)
- High avidity despite lower individual affinity
- Inability to cross placenta (diagnostic significance in newborns)
- Clinical significance of elevated levels (acute infection, autoimmune diseases)
- Clinical significance of deficiency (<20 mg/dL with normal IgG/IgA)
- Association with recurrent respiratory infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases
- Differential diagnosis: Hyper-IgM syndrome, Waldenström macroglobulinemia
- Recent structural insights from cryo-EM and FcμR receptor recognition

### Patient Explanation (PT-BR)
Patient-friendly Portuguese explanation including:
- IgM as "rapid response soldiers" of immune system
- First antibody produced during infection before specialized antibodies
- Five-pointed star structure with ten "arms" to grab pathogens
- Normal values 40-230 mg/dL for adults
- Elevated IgM = active or recent infection
- Low IgM = immune system not responding adequately
- Vulnerability to recurrent respiratory infections
- Importance in newborns (intrauterine infection marker)
- Combined testing with IgG and IgA for complete immune assessment

### Conduct (PT-BR)
Comprehensive clinical protocols covering:

**For Elevated IgM (>230 mg/dL):**
- Investigate acute viral infections (hepatitis A, CMV, EBV, rubella)
- Investigate bacterial infections (Mycoplasma pneumoniae)
- Specific serology with anti-pathogen IgM
- Autoimmune workup: ANA, anti-DNA, complement (SLE, Sjögren)
- Screen for monoclonal gammopathy: serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation
- If monoclonal: evaluate Waldenström macroglobulinemia with bone marrow
- Hyper-IgM syndrome: flow cytometry for CD40L on activated T cells

**For Low IgM (<40 mg/dL):**
- Confirm with repeat testing after 3-4 weeks
- Define selective IgM deficiency vs combined immunodeficiency
- Assess history of recurrent infections (encapsulated bacteria)
- Functional assessment: vaccine response (pneumococcal polysaccharide, tetanus)
- Complete blood count with lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16/56)
- Exclude secondary causes: immunosuppressive drugs, hematologic malignancies, protein loss
- For symptomatic selective IgM deficiency:
  - Prophylactic antibiotics (amoxicillin or azithromycin)
  - Pneumococcal vaccination
  - Early and aggressive infection treatment
- IVIG generally not indicated (contains mainly IgG), consider if functional IgG deficiency
- Immunology referral for severe deficiency, recurrent infections, or suspected primary immunodeficiency
- Monitoring every 6-12 months: immunoglobulin levels, CBC, clinical assessment
