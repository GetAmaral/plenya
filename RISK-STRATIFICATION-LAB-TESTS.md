## 1. AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase / TGO)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

**Rationale:** Both low and high AST levels are associated with increased mortality risk. The relationship between AST and overall mortality demonstrates a U-shaped curve where:
- **Low levels** (<13-16 U/L): Associated with malnutrition, vitamin B6 deficiency, and frailty
- **Middle range** (16-27 U/L): Optimal, lowest mortality risk
- **Elevated levels** (>27-34 U/L): Associated with liver damage, metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular risk

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**Functional Medicine Optimal:** 16-26 U/L (both sexes)
**Conventional Reference:** 0-40 U/L (varies by lab)

**Evidence:**
- OptimalDX recommends <26 U/L for optimal liver and metabolic health
- Superpower (2024) suggests <20 U/L based on longevity research
- World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO): >27 U/L associated with high risk of NASH progression in obese/diabetic patients
- NHANES III analysis: Middle deciles (16-27 U/L for women, 18-34 U/L for men) had lowest mortality

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** U/L (Units per Liter) or IU/L (International Units per Liter)
**Note:** U/L = IU/L (these are equivalent)

**Alternative Units:**
- µkat/L (microkatal per liter): 1 U/L = 0.0167 µkat/L
- nmol/(s·L) (nanomoles per second per liter): 1 U/L = 16.67 nmol/(s·L)

**Mass conversion:** AST measures enzyme **activity**, not mass concentration. Conversion to ng/mL or mg/dL requires knowing specific activity (not standardized).

### Risk Stratification Levels

| Risk Level | Range (U/L) | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Very Low/Deficient** | <13 (women)<br><13-16 (men) | Vitamin B6 deficiency, malnutrition, uremia, severe renal disease. Associated with increased mortality. | <10: Severe deficiency concerns |
| **Low-Optimal** | 13-18 (women)<br>16-20 (men) | Functional medicine optimal range. Lowest mortality risk. Excellent liver and metabolic health. | N/A |
| **Optimal** | 18-26 (women)<br>20-27 (men) | Conventional normal. Good liver health. Acceptable for general population. | N/A |
| **Borderline Elevated** | 27-34 (women)<br>28-40 (men) | Early metabolic dysfunction, subclinical liver stress. May indicate NAFLD risk, especially with obesity/diabetes. | >27: WGO threshold for NASH risk |
| **Moderately Elevated** | 35-100 | Significant liver injury, muscle damage, or hemolysis. Requires investigation. Common causes: hepatitis, alcohol, medications, rhabdomyolysis. | >50: Significant hepatocellular injury |
| **Severely Elevated** | >100 | Acute hepatocellular injury. Possible causes: acute hepatitis, drug toxicity, ischemic hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis. | >1000: Massive hepatic necrosis, acute MI |

### Key Evidence (2023-2026 Literature)

1. **U-Shaped Mortality Curve:**
   - Ruhl CE, Everhart JE (2023). "Association between Liver Enzymes and Mortality Stratified by NAFLD." Nutrients. Analysis of NHANES III showed relative mortality increased at lower values for AST.

2. **Functional Medicine Targets:**
   - OptimalDX Biomarker Guide (2024): Recommends tighter ranges than conventional labs
   - Superpower (2024): Evidence-based optimal range <20 U/L for both sexes

3. **NASH Progression Risk:**
   - World Gastroenterology Organisation guidelines: AST/ALT >27 IU/L in obesity/diabetes = high NASH risk

4. **Epidemiological Data:**
   - Ruhl & Everhart meta-analysis (2014): Both low and high liver enzymes associated with increased all-cause mortality

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**
- **Pediatric:** Higher in infants (40-175 U/L in first 15 days, normalizing to 28-77 U/L by 1 year)
- **Adolescent:** Boys show increasing AST during puberty
- **Elderly:** Comorbidities more important than age itself; maintain adult reference ranges

**Sex Dependencies:**
- Women: Generally 2-3 U/L lower than men
- Hormonal fluctuations minimal impact
- Pregnancy: May decrease slightly in first trimester

**Context Dependencies:**
- **Exercise:** Intense exercise can elevate AST 2-5x (peaks 24-48h post-exercise)
- **Hemolysis:** AST in RBCs; hemolyzed samples falsely elevated
- **Muscle injury:** AST present in skeletal/cardiac muscle; check CK to differentiate

**Common Confounders:**
- Medications: Statins (1-3% show transient elevation), antibiotics, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants
- Macro-AST: Rare, AST bound to immunoglobulins, causes persistent mild elevation
- Fasting: Prolonged fasting can decrease AST

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**
- AST/ALT ratio crucial (see dedicated section)
- AST higher than ALT suggests alcohol, cirrhosis, or cardiac/muscle source
- Isolated AST elevation: Consider cardiac troponin, CK, hemolysis
- AST:ALT ratio <1 typical in NAFLD (without fibrosis)
- AST:ALT ratio >2 suggests alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis

---

## 2. ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase / TGP)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

**Rationale:** Similar to AST, ALT demonstrates a U-shaped relationship with mortality:
- **Low levels** (<9-13 U/L): Associated with frailty, sarcopenia, malnutrition
- **Middle range** (13-27 U/L): Optimal, lowest mortality and metabolic disease risk
- **Elevated levels** (>27-36 U/L): Associated with NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance

ALT is more liver-specific than AST, making it a superior marker for hepatocellular injury.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**Functional Medicine Optimal:**
- Women: 10-19 U/L
- Men: 10-26 U/L

**Conventional Reference:** 0-35 to 0-50 U/L (lab-dependent)

**Evidence:**
- **OptimalDX/IFM:** Recommends <19 U/L (women), <26 U/L (men) based on metabolic health research
- **Superpower (2024):** <20 U/L for both sexes based on longevity and cardiovascular disease risk
- **WGO Guidelines:** ALT >27 U/L in obesity/diabetes = high NASH progression risk
- **Research on obesity:** Upper normal limit should be ≤30 U/L (men), ≤19 U/L (women) to identify NAFLD risk
- **2024 Frontiers Study:** 54% of NAFLD patients had ALT within conventional reference range, indicating current ranges miss early disease

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** U/L (Units per Liter) or IU/L (International Units per Liter)
**Note:** U/L = IU/L (equivalent)

**Alternative Units:**
- µkat/L: 1 U/L = 0.0167 µkat/L
- nmol/(s·L): 1 U/L = 16.67 nmol/(s·L)

**Clinical Definition:** 1 Unit = amount of enzyme catalyzing formation of 1 µmol/min of product

**Mass conversion:** Not standardized (ALT measures activity, not mass)

### Risk Stratification Levels

| Risk Level | Range (U/L) | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Very Low** | <9 (women)<br><13 (men) | Malnutrition, vitamin B6 deficiency, sarcopenia, frailty. Increased mortality risk. | <7: Severe nutritional concern |
| **Low-Optimal (Functional)** | 9-19 (women)<br>13-26 (men) | Functional medicine optimal. Lowest risk of NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease. Best for longevity. | N/A |
| **Optimal (Conventional)** | 19-30 (women)<br>26-35 (men) | Within conventional "normal" but may miss early NAFLD. Acceptable for general population. | N/A |
| **Borderline Elevated** | 31-50 (women)<br>36-50 (men) | Subclinical liver dysfunction. High risk for undiagnosed NAFLD, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome. | >27: WGO NASH risk threshold<br>>30 (men), >19 (women): Revised ULN for NAFLD detection |
| **Moderately Elevated** | 51-200 | Significant hepatocellular injury. Common causes: NASH, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis. | >100: Severe hepatocellular damage |
| **Severely Elevated** | >200 | Acute liver injury. Causes: acute viral hepatitis, drug/toxin-induced (acetaminophen), ischemic hepatitis, acute autoimmune. | >1000: Massive hepatic necrosis |

### Key Evidence (2023-2026 Literature)

1. **NAFLD/NASH Risk Stratification (2024):**
   - **Frontiers in Endocrinology (Sept 2024):** Analysis of 4,753 US adults found ALT/AST ratio >0.98 = 2.19-fold increased NAFLD risk
   - Low-grade NAFLD: ALT:AST ratio 1.07
   - High-grade NAFLD: ALT:AST ratio >1.46

2. **Revised Upper Limits (2024):**
   - Studies excluding metabolic risk factors: ULN ~30 U/L (men), ~19 U/L (women)
   - Research on obese women: Adopting lower guidelines identifies more NAFLD/fibrosis cases

3. **U-Shaped Mortality Curve:**
   - NHANES III (2023): Middle deciles (9-24 U/L for women, 13-36 U/L for men) had lowest mortality
   - Both low and high ALT independently associated with increased mortality

4. **Metabolic Syndrome Association:**
   - Vitamin D sufficiency associated with reduced ALT
   - Even "normal" ALT (within conventional range) associated with increased cardiovascular risk when >27 U/L

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**
- **Pediatric:** Age-specific ranges essential
  - 0-1 year: 7-36 U/L
  - 1-7 years: 12-28 U/L
  - 7-12 years: Similar
  - 12-19 years: 10-27 U/L (converging to adult ranges)
- **Adolescent:** Males show increased ALT 97.5th percentile (up to 63 U/L during puberty)
- **Elderly:** Standard adult ranges apply; comorbidities more relevant than age

**Sex Dependencies:**
- **Women:** Lower reference ranges than men (optimal <19 vs <26 U/L)
- **Pregnancy:** May increase slightly in third trimester (monitor for HELLP, acute fatty liver)
- **Menopause:** No significant change

**Context Dependencies:**
- **Obesity/BMI:** Current reference ranges contaminated by high NAFLD prevalence
- **Diabetes:** ALT >27 U/L = high NASH progression risk
- **Metabolic Syndrome:** Even "normal" ALT may be pathological in this context

**Common Confounders:**
- **Medications:**
  - Statins: 1-3% transient elevation (dose-dependent; atorvastatin 40mg > 20mg)
  - Antibiotics: Synthetic penicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, isoniazid
  - Metformin: Generally hepatoprotective, rarely increases ALT
  - NSAIDs, acetaminophen (dose-dependent toxicity)
- **Supplements:** High-dose niacin, vitamin A toxicity
- **Muscle injury:** ALT in muscle (lesser than AST); severe rhabdomyolysis can elevate both
- **Hemolysis:** Minimal effect (ALT not in RBCs, unlike AST)

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**
- **ALT more liver-specific than AST** (preferred for hepatocellular injury)
- **ALT > AST typical in:** NAFLD, acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced hepatitis
- **AST > ALT suggests:** Alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis (any cause), cardiac/muscle source
- **Both very elevated (>1000):** Acute hepatocellular necrosis (viral, drug, ischemic, autoimmune)
- **ALT elevated, normal bilirubin/albumin:** Early/compensated liver disease
- **ALT + elevated bilirubin/low albumin/high INR:** Advanced liver disease, cirrhosis

**Red Flags:**
- ALT >1000: Acute liver failure risk (acetaminophen toxicity, acute viral hepatitis)
- ALT rising despite addressing etiology: Consider alternative diagnosis
- Chronic mild elevation (40-100) + normal imaging: Consider autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease

---

## 3. AST/ALT Ratio

### Risk Curve Type: **CONTEXT-DEPENDENT (Multiple patterns)**

**Rationale:** The AST/ALT ratio interpretation depends on clinical context:
- **Low ratio (<0.8):** May indicate sarcopenia, malnutrition
- **Optimal ratio (0.8-1.0):** Healthy liver, no significant fibrosis
- **Elevated ratio (>1.0):** Risk interpretation varies by context:
  - If both elevated: Suggests alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, or advanced fibrosis
  - If ratio >0.98 with elevated ALT: Increased NAFLD risk (paradoxical)
  - If ratio >2.0: Strongly suggests alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**Functional Medicine Optimal:** 0.8-1.0
**Clinical Interpretation Thresholds:**
- <0.8: May indicate B6 deficiency or sarcopenia
- 0.8-1.0: Optimal liver health
- >1.0: Requires context-dependent interpretation
- >2.0: Alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis

**Evidence:**
- **OptimalDX (2024):** Emphasizes ratio for metabolic and liver function assessment
- **2024 Frontiers Study:** ALT:AST ratio (inverse) >0.98 = 2.19-fold NAFLD risk
- Traditional teaching: AST:ALT >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis

### NAFLD/NASH Context

**ALT:AST Ratio (inverse of AST:ALT):**
- **<0.98:** Lower NAFLD risk
- **>0.98:** 2.19-fold increased NAFLD risk
- **1.07:** Low-grade NAFLD
- **>1.46:** High-grade NAFLD (severe steatosis)

**AST:ALT Ratio in NAFLD Progression:**
- **<1.0:** NAFLD without significant fibrosis (ALT > AST)
- **≥1.0:** Progression to NASH with fibrosis
- **>1.0:** Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis

### Risk Stratification by Clinical Context

#### A. NAFLD/Metabolic Context

| ALT:AST Ratio | AST:ALT Ratio | Clinical Significance |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| <0.98 | >1.02 | Lower NAFLD risk |
| 0.98-1.07 | 0.93-1.02 | Moderate NAFLD risk (2.19x baseline) |
| 1.07-1.46 | 0.68-0.93 | Low-grade NAFLD |
| >1.46 | <0.68 | High-grade NAFLD (severe steatosis) |

**Note:** In NAFLD **without fibrosis**, ALT typically **exceeds** AST (AST:ALT <1)

#### B. Alcoholic Liver Disease Context

| AST:ALT Ratio | Clinical Significance |
|---------------|----------------------|
| <1.0 | Unlikely alcoholic hepatitis |
| 1.0-2.0 | Possible alcoholic liver disease or NASH with fibrosis |
| >2.0 | Strongly suggests alcoholic hepatitis |
| >3.0 | Virtually diagnostic of alcoholic hepatitis |

#### C. Cirrhosis (Any Etiology)

| AST:ALT Ratio | Clinical Significance |
|---------------|----------------------|
| <1.0 | Unlikely cirrhosis |
| 1.0-1.5 | Possible early cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis |
| >1.5 | Highly suggestive of cirrhosis |
| >2.0 | Consistent with advanced cirrhosis |

**Mechanism:** As cirrhosis progresses, AST rises disproportionately (released from damaged mitochondria), while ALT may decline (reduced hepatocyte mass).

#### D. Blood Glucose/Metabolic Dysregulation Context

**Increased ALT:AST Ratio Associated With:**
- Poor blood glucose regulation
- Insulin resistance
- Metabolic syndrome
- Undiagnosed diabetes
- Increased cardiovascular disease risk

**OptimalDX Interpretation:** Rising ALT:AST suggests metabolic dysfunction even within "normal" enzyme ranges.

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Unit:** Dimensionless ratio (U/L ÷ U/L)
**Calculation:** AST (U/L) ÷ ALT (U/L) = AST:ALT ratio

**Example:**
- AST = 30 U/L, ALT = 25 U/L → AST:ALT = 1.2 (suggests possible fibrosis or alcohol)
- AST = 20 U/L, ALT = 35 U/L → AST:ALT = 0.57, ALT:AST = 1.75 (suggests NAFLD)

### Key Evidence (2023-2026 Literature)

1. **Elevated ALT/AST Ratio as NAFLD Marker (2024):**
   - Wang X, et al. Frontiers in Endocrinology, September 2024
   - 4,753 US adults; ALT:AST >0.98 = 2.19-fold increased NAFLD risk
   - Adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, diabetes, lipids

2. **Traditional AST:ALT Ratio (Historical):**
   - De Ritis ratio (1957): First described diagnostic utility
   - AST:ALT >2 = alcoholic hepatitis (classic teaching)

3. **NAFLD Progression:**
   - Non-alcoholic fatty liver: AST:ALT <1 (ALT > AST)
   - NASH with fibrosis: AST:ALT approaches or exceeds 1.0
   - Advanced cirrhosis (NASH): AST:ALT >1.5

4. **Metabolic Dysfunction:**
   - OptimalDX Research Blog (2023-2024): ALT:AST ratio biomarker of blood glucose regulation and insulin resistance

### Special Considerations

**Clinical Context is CRITICAL:**
- **Ratio alone insufficient:** Must interpret alongside absolute ALT/AST values
- **Example 1:** AST 200, ALT 100 → Ratio 2.0 (alcoholic hepatitis vs acute cardiac event + liver congestion)
- **Example 2:** AST 20, ALT 10 → Ratio 2.0 (malnutrition, B6 deficiency, NOT liver disease)

**Diagnostic Algorithm:**

```
Step 1: Check absolute AST and ALT values
├─ Both normal (within functional range): Ratio less useful
├─ Both low: Consider nutritional deficiency
└─ One or both elevated: Proceed to Step 2

Step 2: Calculate AST:ALT ratio
├─ <1.0: NAFLD (no fibrosis), acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced
├─ 1.0-2.0: NASH with fibrosis, alcoholic liver disease (mild), chronic hepatitis
└─ >2.0: Alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, cardiac source (check troponin)

Step 3: Clinical context
├─ Alcohol use: >2.0 strongly suggests alcoholic hepatitis
├─ Obesity/diabetes + ALT>AST: NAFLD
├─ Cirrhosis known: Rising ratio = disease progression
└─ Chest pain: Check troponin (AST also in cardiac muscle)
```

**Common Confounders:**
- **Hemolysis:** Falsely elevates AST (in RBCs), lowers ratio
- **Macro-AST:** Falsely elevates AST, lowers ratio
- **Exercise:** Elevates AST more than ALT (muscle source), lowers ratio temporarily
- **Medications:** Statins may affect ratio differently depending on statin type

**Limitations:**
- Not validated for acute hepatitis A or B (both enzymes massively elevated, ratio unstable)
- Low sensitivity for early fibrosis (non-invasive elastography preferred)
- Cannot distinguish cirrhosis etiology (alcohol vs NASH vs viral)

## 4. Troponina Ultrassensível (High-Sensitivity Troponin)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR (higher is worse)**

**Rationale:** Troponin demonstrates a linear relationship with adverse outcomes:
- **Undetectable to low-normal:** Optimal, minimal myocardial injury
- **Detectable but <99th percentile:** Increasing cardiovascular risk, prognostic significance
- **>99th percentile:** Myocardial injury (acute or chronic)
- **>99th percentile + rising pattern (>20% delta):** Acute myocardial infarction

**No benefit to extremely low or undetectable troponin** (unlike U-shaped curve). Lower is always better.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**Functional Medicine Optimal:** Undetectable to very low (<5 ng/L)

**Clinical Decision Thresholds:**
- **Limit of Detection (LoD):** Varies by assay (1.3-5 ng/L)
- **99th Percentile URL (Upper Reference Limit):** Diagnostic threshold for myocardial injury

**Sex-Specific 99th Percentile (FDA-approved and research):**

#### hs-Troponin T (Roche Elecsys)
- **Overall:** 14-19 ng/L
- **Men:** 22 ng/L
- **Women:** 14 ng/L
- **FDA-approved:** Single cutoff 19 ng/L, or sex-specific 22/14 ng/L

#### hs-Troponin I (Abbott ARCHITECT)
- **Overall:** 26-34 ng/L
- **Men:** 34 ng/L
- **Women:** 16 ng/L
- **Note:** Abbott values from manufacturer reports; US population studies show lower URLs

#### hs-Troponin I (Siemens Atellica)
- **Overall:** 45-53 ng/L (manufacturer)
- **Men:** 53 ng/L
- **Women:** 37 ng/L
- **Note:** Limited US validation data

#### hs-Troponin I (Ortho VITROS)
- **Overall:** 11.6 ng/L
- **Men:** 15 ng/L
- **Women:** 8 ng/L
- **Note:** Lower than other hs-TnI assays

**Key Point:** 99th percentile values are **assay-specific** and **sex-specific**. Cannot directly compare values between assays. Women have significantly lower 99th percentiles (approximately 40-50% of male values).

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** ng/L (nanograms per liter) for high-sensitivity assays

**Alternative Units:**
- **pg/mL (picograms per milliliter):** 1 ng/L = 1 pg/mL (equivalent)
- **ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter):** 1 ng/mL = 1,000 ng/L = 1,000 pg/mL

**Important:** High-sensitivity assays report in ng/L or pg/mL to distinguish from older assays that report in ng/mL. This prevents confusion and ensures hs-assay recognition.

**Conversion Examples:**
- 14 ng/L = 14 pg/mL = 0.014 ng/mL
- 0.1 ng/mL = 100 ng/L = 100 pg/mL
- 400 ng/L = 400 pg/mL = 0.4 ng/mL

### Risk Stratification Levels

#### General Population (Screening Context)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/L) | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Optimal** | <LoD to <3 | Undetectable or very low. Minimal cardiovascular risk. Optimal cardiac health. | N/A |
| **Low-Normal** | 3-5 | Detectable but very low. Normal for healthy adults. No acute concern. | N/A |
| **Detectable-Normal** | 5 to <99th percentile | Detectable, below diagnostic threshold. May have prognostic significance in heart failure, CKD. | N/A |
| **Borderline** | 99th percentile ±20% | Near diagnostic threshold. Repeat testing essential. Consider chronic elevation vs acute rise. | 99th %ile varies by assay and sex |
| **Elevated** | >99th percentile | Myocardial injury. Requires urgent evaluation. Distinguish acute MI vs chronic elevation. | Absolute delta >15 ng/L or relative delta >20% suggests acute MI |

#### Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Context

| Troponin Level | Delta Change | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **<99th %ile** | Any | Negative for myocardial injury (if presentation >3h and repeat negative) |
| **>99th %ile** | <20% change | Chronic myocardial injury (HF, CKD, myocarditis, PE, etc.) |
| **>99th %ile** | ≥20% rise or fall | Acute myocardial injury (Type 1 MI if compatible with ACS) |
| **>99th %ile** | ≥50% rise or fall | Highly specific for acute MI (but ≥20% preferred to avoid false negatives) |
| **>>99th %ile (>10x)** | Rising | Massive acute MI, STEMI, or fulminant myocarditis |

**Critical:** Diagnosis of acute MI requires:
1. Troponin >99th percentile **AND**
2. Rising or falling pattern (serial measurements) **AND**
3. Clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia (symptoms, ECG changes, imaging)

#### Heart Failure Context (Chronic Elevation)

| hs-TnT Level (ng/L) | Risk Stratification |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| <14 | Lower risk |
| 14-21.5 | Intermediate risk (increased mortality with renal adjustment) |
| 21.5-26.5 | High risk (significantly increased mortality) |
| >26.5 | Very high risk (poor prognosis) |

**Evidence:** 2024 systematic review showed hs-cTnT >14 ng/L independently predicts cardiovascular mortality in HF (HR 1.67-3.22).

#### Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Context

| Clinical Scenario | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| **CKD + hs-Tn detectable but stable** | Chronic elevation due to decreased clearance, LV hypertrophy, subclinical ischemia. Prognostic significance. |
| **CKD + hs-Tn >99th %ile, stable** | Strong predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality. Does NOT indicate acute MI without clinical context. |
| **CKD + hs-Tn rising ≥20% delta** | Suggests acute coronary syndrome, even in presence of chronically elevated baseline. |

**Key:** In CKD, up to 98% have detectable troponin, and 50% exceed 99th percentile without ACS. **Delta change (≥20%)** is critical for diagnosing acute MI.

### Key Evidence (2023-2026 Literature)

1. **Sex-Specific 99th Percentile (2024):**
   - **Systematic Review (December 2024):** Reviewed 19 studies, 11 hs-cTnI assays, 9 hs-cTnT assays
   - >90% of hs-cTnI assays showed lower female 99th percentiles (16-37 ng/L) vs male (34-53 ng/L)
   - Sex-specific cutoffs not widely adopted → underdiagnosis of MI in women

2. **Myocardial Injury Thresholds (2023):**
   - **JACC April 2023:** NHANES population-based study
   - Roche hs-TnT: 99th %ile = 19 ng/L (matched manufacturer)
   - Abbott hs-TnI: 99th %ile lower than manufacturer (US population differs)

3. **Delta Change for Acute MI (2024):**
   - **High-Sensitivity Troponin: Finding a Meaningful Delta (October 2024):** PMC11508916
   - Recommended delta: ≥20% relative change OR ≥15 ng/L absolute change
   - 50% delta cutoff reduces sensitivity, risks false negatives
   - NACB recommendation: 20% dynamic change from elevated baseline = myocardial necrosis

4. **Heart Failure Prognosis (2024):**
   - **Systematic Review (October 2024):** 32 studies, troponin adjusted for renal function predicts CV mortality (HR 1.67-3.22)
   - hs-cTnI baseline >0.03 ng/mL (30 ng/L) significantly correlates with mortality

5. **CKD Populations (2024):**
   - **October 2024 Study:** 4-variable model (NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, albuminuria, eGFR) predicts CV death in CKD
   - Elevated troponin in CKD strongly prognostic, even without ACS

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**
- **Elderly (>70 years):**
  - Troponin concentrations increase up to 300% in healthy elderly vs young adults
  - Men 70-74: median hs-cTnT 9.6 ng/L (IQR 7.2-13.1)
  - Men 90-95: median hs-cTnT 21.2 ng/L (IQR 14.6-26.0)
  - 98% of elderly have detectable cTnT; 52% exceed 14 ng/L without ACS
  - **Interpretation:** Age-related elevation due to comorbidities (CKD, HF, HTN), NOT benign
  - Increased levels in elderly should ALWAYS prompt etiology search

**Sex Dependencies:**
- **Women:** 40-60% lower 99th percentile than men
- **Biological basis:** Smaller LV mass, lower myocyte count
- **Clinical impact:** Single cutoff underdiagnoses MI in women
- **Recommendation:** Use sex-specific cutoffs when available

**Context Dependencies:**

**Chronic Elevation (Non-ACS Causes):**
- Heart failure (50-90% elevated)
- Chronic kidney disease (50-98% elevated, inversely proportional to GFR)
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Pulmonary embolism
- Myocarditis/pericarditis
- Cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic, infiltrative, takotsubo)
- Severe sepsis/critical illness
- Chemotherapy cardiotoxicity
- Cardiac procedures (PCI, ablation, cardioversion)

**Acute Elevation (Non-MI Causes):**
- Type 2 MI (supply-demand mismatch): tachycardia, hypotension, anemia, hypoxia
- Acute PE
- Acute heart failure exacerbation
- Rapid atrial fibrillation
- Acute myocarditis
- Stress cardiomyopathy (takotsubo)

**Common Confounders:**
- **Renal function:** Decreased clearance, also reflects LV hypertrophy from CKD-related HTN
- **Heterophile antibodies:** Rare, causes falsely elevated troponin
- **Analytical variation:** Imprecision at low concentrations (especially near female 99th %ile)
  - 2024 study: Roche CVpooled = 11.7% at 9 ng/L; Abbott CVpooled = 6.3%
- **Skeletal muscle pathology:** Does NOT elevate cardiac troponin (cardiac isoforms are specific)

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**

**Rule-Out MI (0/1h or 0/2h Algorithms):**
- **0h <LoD:** Excellent negative predictive value (>99%)
- **0h and 1h <LoD:** Rule-out MI with high confidence
- **0h <5 ng/L and no delta at 2h:** Low-risk, can discharge with outpatient follow-up

**Rule-In MI:**
- Troponin >99th percentile at presentation OR on repeat
- **AND** absolute delta ≥15 ng/L or relative delta ≥20%
- **AND** clinical ACS features (symptoms, ECG, wall motion abnormality)

**Differentiating Acute vs Chronic Elevation:**
- **Serial measurements mandatory** (at 0, 1-3h, 6h depending on protocol)
- **Delta change key:** ≥20% relative or ≥15 ng/L absolute suggests acute process
- **Clinical context:** Chest pain, ECG changes, new wall motion abnormality = acute
- **Stable elevation:** Suspect HF, CKD, chronic cardiomyopathy

**Red Flags:**
- Troponin >1000 ng/L (1 ng/mL): Massive MI, STEMI, fulminant myocarditis
- Troponin >99th %ile + LBBB: Sgarbossa criteria for STEMI
- Troponin rising + ST-elevation: Activate cath lab (STEMI)
- Troponin elevated + syncope: Consider PE, aortic dissection, ventricular arrhythmia
- Troponin elevated + heart failure: Poor prognosis, consider advanced therapies

## 5. Tempo de Protrombina (PT/INR)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR (higher PT/INR = worse), CONTEXT-DEPENDENT**

**Rationale:** PT/INR interpretation is highly context-dependent:

**A. Warfarin Monitoring Context:**
- **U-SHAPED risk for thrombosis/bleeding:**
  - INR <2.0: Increased thrombosis risk (subtherapeutic)
  - INR 2.0-3.0: Therapeutic (lowest combined risk)
  - INR >3.0: Exponentially increased bleeding risk
  - INR >4.0: Major bleeding risk doubles

**B. Liver Function Assessment Context:**
- **LINEAR: Higher PT/INR = worse liver function**
  - Prolonged PT reflects decreased synthesis of clotting factors (II, VII, V, X, fibrinogen)
  - Factor VII has shortest half-life (4-6h) → PT sensitive to acute liver injury
  - PT/INR used in Child-Pugh and MELD scores for cirrhosis severity

**C. Coagulopathy/Bleeding Risk Context:**
- **PARADOXICAL in cirrhosis:** Elevated INR does NOT predict bleeding risk
  - Cirrhosis = rebalanced hemostasis (reduced pro- and anti-coagulant factors)
  - Elevated INR correlates with **prothrombotic** state in cirrhosis (not hemorrhagic)
  - INR ≥2 in cirrhosis still at risk for VTE (>2x risk, increases with Child-Pugh stage)

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

#### A. Healthy Adults (No Anticoagulation)

**Functional Medicine Optimal:**
- **PT:** 9-12 seconds
- **INR:** 0.9-1.1

**Conventional Reference:**
- **PT:** 9-13 seconds (lab-dependent, based on reagent ISI)
- **INR:** 0.8-1.2

**Evidence:** Prolonged PT in healthy adult suggests factor deficiency, liver dysfunction, or vitamin K deficiency.

#### B. Warfarin Anticoagulation (Therapeutic Ranges)

| Indication | Target INR | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **VTE treatment (DVT, PE)** | 2.5 | 2.0-3.0 |
| **Atrial fibrillation (stroke prevention)** | 2.5 | 2.0-3.0 |
| **Mechanical heart valve (bileaflet/tilting disc)** | 3.0 | 2.5-3.5 |
| **Mechanical heart valve (older caged-ball)** | 3.5 | 3.0-4.0 |
| **Triple therapy (warfarin + antiplatelet)** | 2.25 | 2.0-2.5 (lower target to reduce bleeding) |
| **Elderly with AF (>75 years)** | 2.0-2.5 | 1.5-2.5 (some guidelines allow lower target due to bleed risk) |

**Evidence:**
- 2024 Queensland Health Guideline, AHA/ACC, ACCP guidelines
- Target INR ~2.5 (range 2.0-3.0) is standard for most indications
- Higher risk conditions (mechanical valves): INR 2.5-3.5

#### C. Liver Dysfunction Context

| PT (seconds) | INR | Child-Pugh Points | Interpretation |
|--------------|-----|------------------|----------------|
| <14 (<4s prolonged) | <1.7 | 1 | Mild liver dysfunction |
| 14-17 (4-6s prolonged) | 1.7-2.3 | 2 | Moderate liver dysfunction |
| >17 (>6s prolonged) | >2.3 | 3 | Severe liver dysfunction |

**MELD Score:** Incorporates INR (plus bilirubin, creatinine) to predict 3-month mortality in cirrhosis (used for liver transplant prioritization).

**Important:** INR was validated for warfarin monitoring, NOT liver disease. ISI standardization may not apply to cirrhosis coagulopathy. PT ratio (patient PT / control PT) may be more accurate for liver disease than INR in some contexts.

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit (PT):** Seconds

**Derived Unit (INR):** International Normalized Ratio (dimensionless)

**Conversion Formula:**
```
INR = (Patient PT / Mean Normal PT)^ISI
```
Where:
- **Patient PT:** Measured prothrombin time in seconds
- **Mean Normal PT (MNPT):** Lab-specific control PT (usually 11-13 seconds)
- **ISI (International Sensitivity Index):** Thromboplastin reagent sensitivity (provided by manufacturer)
  - Typical range: 0.9-1.7 (manual methods), 0.94-1.4 (automated, sensitive reagents)
  - Higher ISI = less sensitive reagent

**Example Calculation:**
- Patient PT: 23 seconds
- MNPT: 12 seconds
- ISI: 1.2
- INR = (23 ÷ 12)^1.2 = (1.917)^1.2 = **2.18**

**Why INR?** Standardizes PT results across different labs using different thromboplastin reagents. Critical for safe warfarin management.

### Risk Stratification Levels

#### A. Non-Anticoagulated Patients (Liver Function Assessment)

| Risk Level | PT (sec) | INR | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|----------|-----|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Optimal** | 9-12 | 0.9-1.1 | Normal hepatic synthetic function. Normal coagulation. | N/A |
| **High-Normal** | 12-13 | 1.1-1.3 | Borderline. May indicate early liver dysfunction, mild vitamin K deficiency, or warfarin subtherapeutic. | N/A |
| **Mildly Prolonged** | 13-15 | 1.3-1.7 | Mild liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh 1 point), vitamin K deficiency, warfarin effect, factor deficiency. | >1.5: Investigate cause |
| **Moderately Prolonged** | 15-20 | 1.7-2.3 | Moderate liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh 2 points), significant vitamin K deficiency, therapeutic warfarin. | 1.7-2.3: Child-Pugh B range |
| **Severely Prolonged** | >20 | >2.3 | Severe liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh 3 points), acute liver failure, supratherapeutic warfarin, severe vitamin K deficiency. | >2.3: Child-Pugh C range |
| **Critical** | >30 | >4.0 | Life-threatening coagulopathy. Acute liver failure, warfarin overdose, DIC, massive vitamin K deficiency. | >4.0: Major bleeding risk doubles |

#### B. Warfarin-Anticoagulated Patients

| INR Range | Interpretation | Clinical Action |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **<1.5** | Subtherapeutic | Increase warfarin dose. Thrombosis risk. |
| **1.5-1.9** | Low therapeutic (some indications) | Acceptable for some elderly AF patients or triple therapy. Otherwise increase dose. |
| **2.0-3.0** | Therapeutic (standard target) | Continue current dose. Monitor per protocol. |
| **3.0-3.5** | Therapeutic (mechanical valve target) | Continue if indication = mechanical valve. Otherwise slightly supratherapeutic. |
| **3.5-4.5** | Supratherapeutic | Hold 1 dose, reduce weekly dose, recheck in 3-7 days. Bleeding risk increased. |
| **4.5-10** | High risk | Hold warfarin, consider vitamin K (oral), recheck daily until INR <4. |
| **>10** | Critical | Hold warfarin, vitamin K (IV if bleeding), consider FFP or PCC if active bleeding. |

**2024 Queensland Guideline (Feb 2024):** Provides detailed INR management algorithms for elevated INR with and without bleeding.

#### C. Bleeding Risk Stratification (Warfarin Patients)

| INR | Annual Bleeding Risk | Clinical Significance |
|-----|---------------------|----------------------|
| **<2.0** | 1.6% (baseline, no anticoagulation) | Subtherapeutic |
| **2.0-3.0** | 2-3% | Therapeutic, acceptable bleeding risk |
| **2.5** | 5% | Standard target for most indications |
| **3.0-4.0** | 8-12% | Increased bleeding risk, acceptable only for specific indications (mechanical valve) |
| **>4.0** | >15%, doubles with each 0.5 increase | Major bleeding risk doubles compared to INR 2.0-3.0 |

**Elderly (>75 years):** At greatest risk for intracranial hemorrhage during warfarin therapy. Consider target INR 2.0-2.5 or even 1.5-2.0 in highest-risk elderly.

### Key Evidence (2023-2026 Literature)

1. **Warfarin Monitoring Guidelines (2024):**
   - **Queensland Health (February 2024):** Comprehensive warfarin management guideline
   - Target INR 2.0-3.0 for VTE, AF; 2.5-3.5 for mechanical valves
   - Initial phase: Daily INR until therapeutic for 2 consecutive days
   - Maintenance phase: Can extend to every 12 weeks if stable (≥3 months consistent)

2. **INR and Liver Disease (2020-2024):**
   - **The Misunderstood Coagulopathy of Liver Disease (2018):** Elevated INR in cirrhosis does NOT predict bleeding; may indicate prothrombotic state
   - **2020 Study:** Lab parameters (PT/INR, aPTT) inadequate for assessing bleeding risk in liver cirrhosis; correlate with prothrombotic profile
   - INR not validated for liver disease (ISI standardization for warfarin only)

3. **Child-Pugh and MELD Scores:**
   - **2016 Meta-Analysis:** Both Child-Pugh and MELD predict cirrhosis prognosis
   - MELD uses INR (plus bilirubin, creatinine) for liver transplant allocation
   - Child-Pugh uses PT prolongation (or INR) for staging cirrhosis severity

4. **Bleeding Risk and Age:**
   - Elderly >75 years: Greatest risk for intracranial hemorrhage on warfarin
   - Major bleeding risk with INR >3.0 is >2x compared to INR 2.0-3.0
   - Fall risk does NOT increase bleeding in DOACs (2024 study), but warfarin + falls = higher risk

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**
- **Pediatric:** Different PT/INR ranges; not routinely covered by warfarin guidelines (specialized hematology)
- **Elderly (>75 years):**
  - More sensitive to warfarin, require lower doses
  - Target INR may be reduced (2.0-2.5 or 1.5-2.0) in highest bleed risk
  - Intracranial bleeding risk greatest in elderly on warfarin for AF
  - DOACs preferred over warfarin in most guidelines for elderly AF patients

**Sex Dependencies:**
- No significant sex-specific PT/INR differences in healthy adults
- Women may have slightly lower warfarin dose requirements (smaller body size, drug interactions)

**Context Dependencies:**

**A. Warfarin Monitoring:**
- INR is ONLY validated for warfarin/coumarins
- ISI standardization ensures comparability across labs
- Target depends on indication (see Optimal Range table)
- Frequency: Daily → 2-3x/week → weekly → monthly → up to 12 weeks if stable

**B. Liver Function Assessment:**
- PT/INR reflects hepatic synthetic function (Factors II, V, VII, X, fibrinogen)
- Factor VII shortest half-life (4-6h) → PT sensitive to acute liver injury
- PT prolongation + elevated bilirubin + low albumin = advanced liver disease
- **CRITICAL:** Elevated INR in cirrhosis does NOT mean bleeding risk; paradoxically prothrombotic

**C. Coagulopathy Diagnosis:**
- Prolonged PT + normal aPTT: Factor VII deficiency, early vitamin K deficiency, early warfarin effect, early liver disease
- Prolonged PT + prolonged aPTT: Severe liver disease, DIC, vitamin K deficiency, warfarin overdose, heparin, common pathway defect (fibrinogen, prothrombin, V, X)
- Mixing study differentiates factor deficiency vs inhibitor

**Common Confounders:**

**Medications:**
- **Increase PT/INR (potentiate warfarin):** Amiodarone, fluconazole, metronidazole, sulfa drugs, macrolides, NSAIDs, aspirin, clopidogrel
- **Decrease PT/INR (antagonize warfarin):** Rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, vitamin K, St. John's Wort
- **Antibiotics:** Alter gut flora → decrease vitamin K production → increase INR
- **Statins:** May potentiate warfarin (minor effect)

**Diet:**
- **High vitamin K intake:** Decreases INR (leafy greens, broccoli, kale, liver)
- **Low vitamin K / poor nutrition:** Increases INR
- **Alcohol:** Acute intake increases INR; chronic use may decrease INR

**Other Factors:**
- **Diarrhea/malabsorption:** Decreases vitamin K absorption → increases INR
- **Acute illness/fever:** May increase INR (increased warfarin sensitivity)
- **Thyroid disease:** Hyperthyroid increases INR; hypothyroid decreases INR

**Laboratory Issues:**
- **Hematocrit <25% or >55%:** May affect PT accuracy (citrate tube fill volume)
- **Sample handling:** Must be analyzed within 4h; delayed testing may prolong PT
- **ISI variability:** Different reagents yield different INR; use same lab for consistency

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**

**Isolated Prolonged PT (normal aPTT):**
- **Early warfarin effect** (Factor VII depleted first due to short half-life)
- **Factor VII deficiency** (congenital, rare)
- **Early vitamin K deficiency**
- **Early liver disease** (synthetic function declining)

**PT + aPTT Both Prolonged:**
- **Severe liver disease / cirrhosis** (multiple factor deficiencies)
- **Vitamin K deficiency** (factors II, VII, IX, X require vitamin K)
- **Warfarin overdose**
- **DIC** (consumption of clotting factors + fibrinogen)
- **Common pathway defect:** Fibrinogen, prothrombin, Factor V or X deficiency

**Prolonged PT in Liver Disease vs Warfarin:**

| Feature | Warfarin | Liver Disease |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Inhibits vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X) | Decreased synthesis of all clotting factors |
| **Factor V** | Normal | Decreased (Factor V not vitamin K-dependent) |
| **Mixing Study** | Corrects (factor deficiency) | Corrects (factor deficiency) |
| **Response to Vitamin K** | Corrects PT/INR | Minimal to no response |
| **Platelets** | Normal | Often decreased (splenomegaly, decreased TPO) |
| **Other signs** | None | Jaundice, ascites, low albumin, high bilirubin |

**PT/INR and Procedural Risk:**

| Procedure Type | Safe INR Range | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Dental extraction, simple** | <3.0 | Usually safe; may continue warfarin |
| **Endoscopy, diagnostic** | <2.5 | Usually safe; may continue warfarin |
| **Endoscopy with biopsy/polypectomy** | <1.5 | Hold warfarin 5 days, bridge if high VTE risk |
| **Major surgery** | <1.5 | Hold warfarin 5 days, bridge if needed |
| **Neuraxial anesthesia (spinal, epidural)** | <1.5 | Hold warfarin, check INR before procedure |
| **High bleeding risk procedure** | <1.2-1.5 | Hold warfarin, consider vitamin K, check INR |

**Red Flags:**
- **INR >10 on warfarin:** Critical bleeding risk, hold warfarin, give vitamin K, monitor closely
- **INR >2.0 with active bleeding:** Consider FFP or PCC (prothrombin complex concentrate) + vitamin K
- **New PT prolongation + jaundice + encephalopathy:** Acute liver failure, consider transplant evaluation
- **PT prolonged + petechiae + low platelets + falling fibrinogen:** DIC, life-threatening
- **INR >2.0 before surgery (patient on warfarin):** Delay elective surgery or reverse with vitamin K/FFP/PCC

**Management of Elevated INR (Warfarin Patients - 2024 Guidelines):**

| INR | No Bleeding | Minor Bleeding | Major Bleeding |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **3.0-4.5** | Hold 0-1 dose, reduce weekly dose, recheck 3-7 days | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 2.5-5mg PO, recheck 24h | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 5-10mg IV slow, FFP/PCC if urgent, recheck 6-12h |
| **4.5-10** | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 2.5-5mg PO if high bleed risk, recheck 24-48h | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 5-10mg PO or IV, recheck 12-24h | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 10mg IV, PCC preferred (or FFP), repeat vit K q12h PRN |
| **>10** | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 5-10mg PO, recheck 12-24h, repeat vit K if needed | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 10mg IV, consider FFP/PCC, recheck 6-12h | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 10mg IV, PCC 50 units/kg (or FFP 15mL/kg), recheck q6h, repeat as needed |

## 6. Clinical Implementation Guidelines

### A. Risk Stratification Workflow

#### Step 1: Determine Clinical Context
- **Screening/wellness:** Use functional medicine optimal ranges
- **Acute illness:** Use sex-specific diagnostic thresholds
- **Chronic disease management:** Consider context-dependent interpretation
- **Medication monitoring:** Compare to therapeutic targets

#### Step 2: Assess Risk Curve Type
- **Linear (Troponin):** Higher = worse, no U-shape
- **U-shaped (AST, ALT):** Both low and high are pathological
- **Context-dependent (PT/INR, AST/ALT ratio):** Interpretation varies by indication

#### Step 3: Apply Risk Stratification
- Compare patient value to optimal, borderline, elevated thresholds
- Consider age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities
- Evaluate trends (single value vs serial measurements)
- Calculate ratios where applicable (AST/ALT, ALT/AST)

#### Step 4: Integrate Clinical Data
- Symptoms and physical exam
- Other lab values (comprehensive metabolic panel, lipids, inflammatory markers)
- Imaging and non-invasive testing (ultrasound, elastography, echocardiogram)
- Medication list and supplement use

#### Step 5: Individualized Action Plan
- **Optimal range:** Maintain with lifestyle, reassess per screening guidelines
- **Borderline:** Lifestyle optimization, address root causes, recheck in 3-6 months
- **Elevated:** Further diagnostic workup, treatment, specialist referral as needed
- **Critical:** Urgent/emergent evaluation and intervention

### B. Functional Medicine Approach

#### Key Principles:
1. **Optimal vs Normal:** Aim for optimal ranges (tighter than conventional), not just "within normal"
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify underlying drivers (diet, toxins, inflammation, gut health, stress)
3. **Personalization:** Consider genetic polymorphisms (e.g., MTHFR, apoE), nutrigenomics, microbiome
4. **Trend Analysis:** Serial measurements more valuable than single data point
5. **Systems Biology:** Integrate multiple biomarkers to assess whole-body health

#### Lifestyle Interventions for Liver Enzymes (AST/ALT):
- **Diet:** Mediterranean diet, reduce processed foods, sugar, alcohol
- **Weight loss:** 5-10% weight loss improves NAFLD
- **Exercise:** 150 min/week moderate intensity
- **Supplements:** Vitamin E (800 IU/day for NASH), omega-3, NAC, milk thistle, berberine
- **Avoid hepatotoxins:** Minimize alcohol, unnecessary medications, environmental toxins

#### Cardiovascular Optimization (Troponin):
- **Primary prevention:** Address traditional risk factors (HTN, DM, dyslipidemia, smoking)
- **Secondary prevention:** Optimal medical therapy post-ACS (DAPT, statin, beta-blocker, ACE-I)
- **Advanced testing:** CAC score, CIMT, lipoprotein fractionation (Lp(a), apoB, LDL-P)
- **Lifestyle:** Whole-food plant-based or Mediterranean diet, regular exercise, stress management
- **Supplements:** Omega-3, CoQ10, magnesium, vitamin D, garlic, bergamot

#### Anticoagulation Management (PT/INR):
- **Diet consistency:** Stable vitamin K intake (don't avoid greens, just be consistent)
- **Medication interactions:** Careful review before adding/stopping any medication
- **Patient education:** Signs of bleeding, when to call physician, carry medical alert card
- **Home monitoring:** Consider INR self-testing for stable patients (improves time in therapeutic range)
- **DOACs consideration:** For many indications, DOACs preferred over warfarin (fewer interactions, no INR monitoring, lower ICH risk)

### C. Reporting and Documentation

#### Laboratory Report Should Include:
1. **Test name and abbreviation** (e.g., AST, hs-Troponin I, PT/INR)
2. **Result with units** (e.g., 25 U/L, 12 ng/L, INR 2.3)
3. **Reference range** (conventional and/or optimal)
4. **Sex-specific ranges** when applicable (hs-Troponin, ALT)
5. **Assay manufacturer** (for hs-Troponin, critical for interpretation)
6. **Flag for out-of-range values** (H, L, Critical)
7. **Delta from previous value** (especially for Troponin, INR)
8. **Interpretive comments** for complex tests (e.g., AST/ALT ratio)

#### Clinical Note Documentation (EMR System):
- **Risk level:** Optimal, Borderline, Elevated, Critical
- **Clinical significance:** Brief interpretation in context
- **Comparison to previous values:** Improving, stable, worsening
- **Contributing factors identified:** Medications, diet, comorbidities
- **Action plan:** Further testing, referrals, medication changes, lifestyle interventions
- **Follow-up plan:** When to recheck labs, escalation triggers

### D. Patient Education

#### Key Messages:
- **Optimal vs Normal:** Explain why tighter ranges may be used in functional medicine
- **Trend matters:** Single elevated value may be less concerning than upward trend
- **Lifestyle impact:** Empower patients with actionable diet, exercise, stress management
- **Medication adherence:** For anticoagulation, emphasize critical importance of INR monitoring
- **Warning signs:** When to seek urgent care (chest pain for troponin, bleeding for INR, jaundice for liver enzymes)

#### Visual Aids:
- **Risk stratification charts:** Color-coded (green optimal, yellow borderline, orange elevated, red critical)
- **Trend graphs:** Plot serial values over time to visualize progress
- **Target ranges:** Clearly mark optimal, acceptable, and concerning ranges on result printouts

## Appendix: Quick Reference Tables

### A. AST/ALT Interpretation Flowchart

```
1. Both AST and ALT elevated?
   ├─ YES → Check AST:ALT ratio
   │   ├─ Ratio <1 (ALT > AST) → NAFLD, acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced
   │   ├─ Ratio 1-2 → NASH with fibrosis, chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver (mild)
   │   └─ Ratio >2 → Alcoholic hepatitis (likely), cirrhosis, check troponin (cardiac?)
   │
   └─ NO → Check which is elevated
       ├─ AST only elevated → Hemolysis, cardiac (check troponin), muscle (check CK), macro-AST
       └─ ALT only elevated → Hepatocellular injury (preferred marker), early liver disease

2. Both AST and ALT low?
   └─ Consider: Malnutrition, vitamin B6 deficiency, uremia, sarcopenia (check albumin, B6)

3. Magnitude of elevation?
   ├─ <2x ULN → Chronic liver disease, NAFLD, medications
   ├─ 2-10x ULN → Hepatitis (viral, autoimmune, drug), biliary obstruction
   └─ >10x ULN (>500) → Acute hepatocellular necrosis (acetaminophen, ischemic, acute viral)
```

### B. Troponin Interpretation Algorithm

```
Patient with chest pain or ACS concern
│
├─ Troponin <LoD or <5 ng/L at 0h and 1-2h
│  └─ Rule-out MI (NPV >99%), low risk, consider discharge
│
├─ Troponin detectable but <99th percentile
│  └─ Negative for acute MI (if >3h from symptom onset and stable)
│      Consider chronic causes if persistently detectable (HF, CKD)
│
├─ Troponin >99th percentile, stable (no delta)
│  └─ Myocardial injury, but NOT acute MI
│      Investigate: HF, CKD, PE, myocarditis, chronic cardiomyopathy
│
└─ Troponin >99th percentile + rising/falling (≥20% delta or ≥15 ng/L absolute)
   └─ Acute myocardial injury
       ├─ + ACS symptoms/ECG → Acute MI (Type 1 or 2)
       └─ - ACS features → Acute non-ACS cause (PE, myocarditis, takotsubo, etc.)

### C. INR Management Quick Reference (Warfarin)

| INR Result | Clinical Action (No Bleeding) | Next Check |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------|
| <1.5 | Increase dose, assess adherence | 3-7 days |
| 1.5-1.9 | Slight increase dose (if target 2.0-3.0) | 1-2 weeks |
| 2.0-3.0 | Continue (therapeutic) | Per protocol (weekly to 12 weeks) |
| 3.0-4.5 | Hold 0-1 dose, reduce weekly dose | 3-7 days |
| 4.5-10 | Hold warfarin, consider vitamin K 2.5-5mg PO | 24-48h |
| >10 | Hold warfarin, vitamin K 5-10mg PO | 12-24h, may repeat |

**If bleeding:** Add vitamin K (IV preferred), consider FFP/PCC, urgent hematology consult.

### D. Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges Summary

| Test | Conventional Range | Functional Medicine Optimal |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **AST** | 0-40 U/L | 16-26 U/L |
| **ALT (Women)** | 0-35 U/L | 10-19 U/L |
| **ALT (Men)** | 0-50 U/L | 10-26 U/L |
| **AST:ALT Ratio** | 0.8-2.0 | 0.8-1.0 |
| **hs-Troponin (Women)** | <14-16 ng/L (99th %ile) | <5 ng/L |
| **hs-Troponin (Men)** | <22-34 ng/L (99th %ile, assay-dependent) | <5 ng/L |
| **PT** | 9-13 seconds | 9-12 seconds |
| **INR (no anticoagulation)** | 0.8-1.2 | 0.9-1.1 |
