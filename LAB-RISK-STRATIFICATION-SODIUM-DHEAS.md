## 1. SODIUM (SERUM)

### Risk Curve Type: U-SHAPED

**Rationale:** Both low (hyponatremia) and high (hypernatremia) serum sodium levels are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The relationship forms a clear U-shaped curve with optimal health outcomes in the narrow middle range (138-142 mEq/L).

**Key Evidence:**
- U-shaped association documented between discharge serum sodium and one-year mortality, with nadir mortality at 138-142 mEq/L
- Both extremes (≤137 and ≥143 mEq/L) show significantly higher mortality risk
- Biological age reaches its lowest point at 138-142 mmol/L
- Middle-age serum sodium >142 mmol/L associated with 39% increased risk of chronic diseases
- Serum sodium >144 mmol/L linked to 21% elevated risk of premature mortality

---

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** mEq/L (milliequivalents per liter) or mmol/L (millimoles per liter)

**Important Note:** For sodium (a monovalent ion), these units are numerically equivalent:
- **1 mEq/L = 1 mmol/L** (no conversion needed)

This is because univalent ions like Na+ have the same number of moles as equivalents in solution.

**Conventional Laboratory Range:** 135-145 mEq/L
**Functional Medicine Optimal Range:** 138-142 mEq/L (OptimalDX: 137-142 mEq/L)

---

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**OPTIMAL: 138-142 mEq/L (mmol/L)**

This narrower range represents:
- Lowest mortality risk (all-cause and cardiovascular)
- Optimal biological aging markers
- Minimal risk of chronic disease development
- Best hydration status for longevity

**Rationale:**
- Research consistently shows this range has the lowest mortality across multiple large population studies
- Maintains optimal cellular hydration without extremes
- Associated with delayed biological aging
- Minimizes cardiovascular and chronic disease risk
- Supports healthy metabolic function

**Comparison to Conventional:**
- Conventional range (135-145 mEq/L) focuses on disease detection
- Functional range (138-142 mEq/L) targets optimal health and longevity
- Values within conventional but outside functional range (135-137, 143-145) associated with increased health risks

### Risk Stratification Levels

| Risk Level | Range (mEq/L) | Clinical Significance | Population Impact |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <120 | Severe hyponatremia: High risk of seizures, coma, brain herniation. Medical emergency. Rapidly fatal without treatment. | Mortality risk dramatically elevated |
| **SEVERE LOW** | 120-124 | Severe hyponatremia: Delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia. Very high mortality risk. Requires immediate intervention. | OR 2-3x for hospital mortality |
| **MODERATE LOW** | 125-129 | Moderate hyponatremia: Nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, cognitive deficits. Significantly increased mortality. | 71% increased all-cause mortality |
| **BORDERLINE LOW** | 130-137 | Mild hyponatremia: Often asymptomatic but associated with increased long-term mortality and morbidity. Falls, cognitive decline. | HR 1.54-1.89 for mortality vs optimal |
| **OPTIMAL** | 138-142 | Optimal range: Lowest mortality, best biological aging markers, minimal chronic disease risk. Target for health optimization. | Baseline (lowest risk) |
| **BORDERLINE HIGH** | 143-145 | High-normal: Within conventional range but increased risk of chronic diseases, accelerated biological aging, cardiovascular events. | 39% increased chronic disease risk if >142; HR 1.5-2.0 for mortality vs optimal |
| **MODERATE HIGH** | 146-149 | Mild hypernatremia: Thirst, restlessness, confusion. Cellular dehydration. Increased mortality risk. | 50% higher odds of biological aging acceleration |
| **SEVERE HIGH** | 150-159 | Moderate hypernatremia: Lethargy, confusion, muscle twitching, focal neurological deficits. High mortality risk. | OR 2.66 for hospital mortality |
| **CRITICAL HIGH** | ≥160 | Severe hypernatremia: Seizures, coma, intracranial hemorrhage from brain cell shrinkage. Medical emergency. High mortality. | Mortality risk dramatically elevated |

### Key Thresholds

**Critical Action Points:**
- **<125 mEq/L:** EMERGENCY - Risk of seizures/coma, immediate hospitalization
- **<120 mEq/L:** EXTREME EMERGENCY - High risk of death without rapid intervention
- **≥150 mEq/L:** EMERGENCY - Severe cellular dehydration, hospitalization needed
- **≥160 mEq/L:** EXTREME EMERGENCY - Risk of seizures, coma, intracranial bleeding

**Functional Medicine Targets:**
- **138-142 mEq/L:** PRIMARY TARGET for health optimization and longevity
- **135-137 mEq/L:** Acceptable but suboptimal; investigate causes, optimize hydration
- **143-145 mEq/L:** Acceptable but suboptimal; assess hydration status, kidney function

---

### Key Evidence (2023-2026)

**Major Studies:**

1. **Frontiers in Nutrition 2025** - "Serum sodium within the normal range and its U-shaped relationship with biological aging in U.S. adults"
   - Cross-sectional study of U.S. adults
   - Documented U-shaped curve with biological age nadir at 138-142 mmol/L
   - Maintaining sodium in optimal range may delay biological aging

2. **EBioMedicine 2023** - "Middle-age high normal serum sodium as a risk factor for accelerated biological aging, chronic diseases, and premature mortality"
   - ARIC study with 25-year follow-up (N=11,255)
   - Serum sodium 138-142 mmol/L: lowest risk
   - Serum sodium >142 mmol/L: 39% increased chronic disease risk
   - Serum sodium >144 mmol/L: 21% increased premature mortality
   - 50% higher odds of biological aging if >142 mmol/L

3. **International Journal of Clinical Practice 2020** - Discharge sodium levels and mortality
   - U-shaped mortality distribution
   - Optimal discharge sodium: 138-142 mEq/L
   - Both ≤137 and ≥143 mEq/L showed significantly higher one-year mortality

4. **NIH Press Release 2023** - "Good hydration linked to healthy aging"
   - Analysis from ARIC study
   - Adults with serum sodium 138-140 mEq/L had lowest chronic disease risk
   - Higher sodium levels suggest inadequate hydration
   - Findings support hydration as longevity intervention

**Mortality Risk Data:**
- Serum sodium 135-136.5 mmol/L: 71% increased all-cause mortality vs 137-142 mmol/L
- Borderline hyponatremia (130-134 mEq/L): OR 1.89 for hospital mortality
- Borderline hypernatremia (145-149 mEq/L): OR 2.66 for hospital mortality
- Lowest mortality observed: 137-142 mmol/L across multiple studies

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**
- Elderly: Higher risk of hyponatremia due to:
  - Decreased renal concentrating ability
  - Multiple medications (diuretics, SSRIs, antipsychotics)
  - Reduced thirst sensation
  - SIADH more common
- Maintain vigilance for sodium abnormalities in patients >65 years

**Context Dependencies:**
1. **Hydration Status:**
   - Higher sodium (>142) may indicate chronic dehydration
   - Assess water intake, encourage adequate hydration
   - Target: 2-3 liters/day depending on activity, climate

2. **Medications:**
   - Diuretics: Can cause hyponatremia or hypernatremia
   - SSRIs: Risk of SIADH and hyponatremia
   - NSAIDs: Can affect sodium handling
   - Review medication list for sodium-altering drugs

3. **Underlying Conditions:**
   - Heart failure: Often presents with dilutional hyponatremia
   - Kidney disease: Impaired sodium regulation
   - Adrenal insufficiency: Hyponatremia common
   - Diabetes insipidus: Risk of hypernatremia
   - SIADH: Inappropriate ADH secretion causing low sodium

4. **Acute vs Chronic:**
   - **Acute changes (<48 hours):** More dangerous, higher symptom severity
   - **Chronic changes (>48 hours):** Brain adapts, may be asymptomatic
   - **Correction rate matters:** Too-rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome

**Common Confounders:**
- Hyperglycemia: Falsely lowers sodium (1.6 mEq/L decrease per 100 mg/dL glucose >100)
- Hyperlipidemia/hyperproteinemia: Pseudohyponatremia (artifact)
- Blood collection technique: Tourniquet time, hemolysis

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**

**For LOW sodium (hyponatremia):**
- Assess volume status: hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic?
- Check urine osmolality and urine sodium
- Consider: SIADH, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, medications
- Symptoms correlate with rapidity of decline, not just absolute value

**For HIGH sodium (hypernatremia):**
- Assess fluid intake and losses
- Check urine osmolality
- Consider: inadequate water intake, diabetes insipidus, osmotic diuresis
- Evaluate mental status and thirst mechanism
- Check for excessive sodium intake (rare)

**Functional Medicine Approach:**
- Target 138-142 mEq/L for optimal longevity
- Emphasize adequate hydration as lifestyle intervention
- Monitor trends over time, not just single values
- Correlate with other biomarkers: kidney function, hormones
- Consider cellular hydration assessments (bioimpedance analysis)
- Address root causes rather than just treating numbers

---

## 2. DHEA-S (DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATE)

### Risk Curve Type: LINEAR (Lower is Worse)

**Rationale:** DHEA-S declines progressively with age (adrenopause), and low levels are consistently associated with:
- Increased all-cause mortality
- Increased cardiovascular disease and mortality
- Accelerated biological aging
- Frailty, cognitive decline, osteoporosis
- Reduced immune function

**Critical 2025 Update:** Recent Mendelian randomization study found UNEXPECTED sex-specific findings:
- In women: DHEA-S unrelated to lifespan
- In men: Higher DHEA-S associated with SHORTER lifespan (-1.15 years per logged μmol/L)
- This contradicts older observational studies

**Current Evidence Interpretation:**
- Observational studies consistently show low DHEA-S = higher mortality
- However, genetic studies (2025) suggest causality is uncertain, especially in men
- U-shaped relationship possible: very low AND very high levels may be problematic
- Functional medicine focus: maintaining mid-to-upper age-appropriate range, not supraphysiological supplementation

---

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** μg/dL (micrograms per deciliter)

**Alternative Units:**
- μmol/L (micromoles per liter)

**Conversion Factors:**
- Molecular weight of DHEA-S: 367.5 g/mol
- **μg/dL × 0.027 = μmol/L**
- **μmol/L × 37 ≈ μg/dL**

**Examples:**
- 200 μg/dL = 5.4 μmol/L
- 100 μg/dL = 2.7 μmol/L
- 10 μmol/L = 370 μg/dL

**Clinical Note:** Most U.S. laboratories report in μg/dL; European labs often use μmol/L. Always verify units before interpretation.

---

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**CRITICAL: DHEA-S is HIGHLY AGE- AND SEX-DEPENDENT**

There is NO single "optimal range" - interpretation MUST account for age and gender.

**General Principles:**
- Peaks in 20s-30s (women: ~24 years; men: ~30 years)
- Declines 29% per decade in men
- By age 70: levels are 10-20% of youthful peak
- Women have lower absolute values than men at all ages
- Post-menopausal women rely more on DHEA-S for hormone production (>90% of estrogen from adrenal DHEA)

**Functional Medicine Targets:**
- **Goal:** Mid-to-upper quartile of age- and sex-matched reference range
- **Men (40-60 years):** Upper third of reference range (280-500 μg/dL)
- **Women (40-60 years):** Middle-to-upper range (140-270 μg/dL)
- **Caution:** Levels below 25th percentile increase mortality risk
- **Warning (2025 data):** Very high levels may be problematic, especially in men

**Not "Normal" but "Optimal":**
- Conventional ranges capture 95% of population (including aged, unhealthy individuals)
- Functional medicine targets youthful, healthy ranges for age group
- Aim for levels typical of healthy individuals in same age/sex category

### Key Thresholds

**For Adrenal Tumor Suspicion:**
- **≥600 μg/dL (16.2 μmol/L) at any age:** High suspicion for androgen-secreting adrenal tumor or adrenocortical carcinoma
- Over 90% of adrenocortical carcinomas show normal or elevated DHEA/DHEA-S
- Requires imaging (CT/MRI adrenals) and endocrinology referral

**For Adrenal Insufficiency:**
- Age-adjusted, but generally:
  - **<80 μg/dL (2.2 μmol/L) in adults <50 years**
  - **<50 μg/dL (1.4 μmol/L) in adults 50-70 years**
  - **<30 μg/dL (0.8 μmol/L) in adults >70 years**
- Low DHEA-S is sensitive and specific for subclinical hypercortisolism in adrenal incidentalomas

**For Mortality Risk (Observational Data):**
- **Lowest quartile** vs upper quartiles:
  - Men: HR 1.54 for all-cause mortality; HR 1.61 for CVD mortality
  - Women: Evidence mixed; WISE study showed association with CVD mortality in postmenopausal women
- Every 100 μg/dL increase associated with 36% reduction in all-cause mortality and 48% reduction in CVD mortality (1986 NEJM study, men 50-79)

**For Supplementation Consideration (Functional Medicine):**
- **Men:** <25th percentile for age (typically <200 μg/dL at age 40-60)
- **Women:** <25th percentile for age (typically <100 μg/dL at age 40-60)
- **Typical doses:**
  - Men: 25-50 mg/day
  - Women: 10-25 mg/day
  - Take in morning (mimics diurnal rhythm)
  - Monitor levels after 3 months

### Key Evidence (2023-2026)

**Major Studies and Reviews:**

1. **ScienceDirect 2025** - "Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate on lifespan in men and women using Mendelian randomization"
   - **CRITICAL FINDING:** Genetic analysis shows DHEA-S unrelated to lifespan in women; higher DHEA-S associated with SHORTER lifespan in men (-1.15 years per logged μmol/L, p=0.0017)
   - Contradicts observational studies suggesting benefits
   - Suggests low DHEA-S may be marker of poor health rather than cause
   - Calls into question routine DHEA supplementation for longevity

2. **Annals of Palliative Medicine (Meta-analysis)** - "Circulating DHEA-S level and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in elderly"
   - Pooled RR of all-cause mortality: 1.46 (95% CI 1.25-1.70) for lowest vs highest DHEA-S
   - Pooled RR of CVD mortality: 1.49 (95% CI 1.11-1.99)
   - Association only observed in men, not women
   - Conclusion: Low DHEA-S predicts mortality in elderly men

3. **Journal of the American Heart Association 2017** - "Prognostic Value of DHEA-S for Cardiovascular Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"
   - Lower DHEA-S: RR 1.47 (95% CI 1.38-1.56) for all-cause mortality
   - Lower DHEA-S: RR 1.58 (95% CI 1.30-1.91) for fatal CVD events
   - Non-fatal CVD events also associated with low DHEA-S

4. **NEJM 1986** - "A Prospective Study of DHEA-S, Mortality, and CVD" (Landmark Study)
   - 12-year follow-up of 242 men aged 50-79
   - 100 μg/dL increase in DHEA-S:
     - 36% reduction in all-cause mortality
     - 48% reduction in CVD mortality
   - No association found in women in this cohort

5. **Swedish MrOS Study** - "Low serum levels of DHEA-S predict all-cause and CVD mortality in elderly Swedish men"
   - N=2,644 elderly men
   - Lowest quartile vs quartiles 2-4:
     - HR 1.54 for all-cause mortality (95% CI 1.21-1.96)
     - HR 1.61 for CVD mortality (95% CI 1.10-2.37)
     - HR 1.67 for ischemic heart disease mortality (95% CI 1.02-2.74)
   - No association with cancer mortality

6. **WISE Study** - "DHEA-S Levels and CVD Mortality in Postmenopausal Women"
   - Women with coronary risk factors undergoing angiography
   - Lower DHEA-S linked to higher CVD and all-cause mortality
   - One of few studies showing association in women

7. **Women's Health and Aging Study** - U-shaped relationship
   - U-shaped relationship between DHEA-S and all-cause mortality in women
   - Highest cancer mortality at highest levels
   - Highest CVD mortality at lowest levels
   - Suggests optimal mid-range for women

**Biomarker of Aging Literature:**
- DHEA-S widely regarded as reliable endocrine marker of aging due to predictable decline and long half-life
- Levels decline 29% per decade in men
- By age 70, levels are 10-20% of peak (mid-20s)
- DHEA-S used as marker in calorie restriction studies and anti-aging research

**Gender-Specific Observations:**
- Meta-analyses show stronger/more consistent associations in men than women
- Post-menopausal women depend on DHEA for >90% of estrogen production (peripheral aromatization)
- DHEA supplementation increases testosterone more in women than men
- Women may have U-shaped relationship vs linear in men

---

### Special Considerations

#### Age Dependencies (CRITICAL)

**DHEA-S is THE most age-dependent hormone**

- Peaks: Women ~24 years, Men ~30 years
- Declines rapidly after peak, then moderately after age 50-60
- Interpretation MUST use age- and sex-matched reference ranges
- Comparing a 60-year-old's DHEA-S to a 30-year-old's range is clinically meaningless

**Age-Related Changes:**
- 20s-30s: Peak production, optimal levels
- 40s: Noticeable decline begins (perimenopausal for women)
- 50s: Accelerated decline in women (postmenopausal), continued decline in men
- 60s-70s: Levels 30-50% of peak
- 80s+: Levels 10-20% of peak (adrenopause)

**Clinical Implication:** Always interpret DHEA-S in context of patient's age. A level that is "optimal" at age 30 would be "abnormally high" at age 60.

---

#### Gender Dependencies (CRITICAL)

**Men vs Women - Key Differences:**

1. **Absolute Levels:**
   - Men have higher DHEA-S at all ages (typically 2-3x higher than women)
   - Peak values: Men 300-600 μg/dL, Women 200-400 μg/dL

2. **Mortality Associations:**
   - Meta-analyses: Strong consistent association in MEN
   - Women: Weaker, inconsistent across studies; possible U-shaped curve
   - 2025 Mendelian randomization: No association in women, INVERSE in men (higher = shorter life)

3. **Hormone Conversion:**
   - Women: DHEA-S → DHEA → Testosterone → Estradiol (via aromatase)
   - Postmenopausal women: >90% of estrogen from adrenal DHEA
   - Men: Less dependent on DHEA for sex hormone production

4. **Supplementation Response:**
   - Women: Greater increase in testosterone from DHEA supplementation
   - Women: More likely to experience androgenic side effects (acne, hirsutism)
   - Men: May not see significant testosterone increase unless hypogonadal

5. **Clinical Significance:**
   - Women: DHEA-S more important postmenopause for estrogen production
   - Men: DHEA-S primarily marker of adrenal function and vitality

**Clinical Implication:** Gender-specific reference ranges are MANDATORY. Use separate risk stratification tables for men and women.

---

#### Context Dependencies

1. **Diurnal Variation:**
   - **DHEA shows diurnal variation** (peaks morning, nadirs evening)
   - **DHEA-S shows NO diurnal variation** (stable throughout day)
   - This is why DHEA-S is preferred clinical marker
   - Blood draw timing less critical than for cortisol or DHEA

2. **Adrenal Tumors:**
   - Levels >600 μg/dL: 90% sensitivity for androgen-secreting adrenal tumor
   - Both benign adenomas and adrenocortical carcinomas can elevate DHEA-S
   - All adrenocortical carcinomas show normal or elevated DHEA/DHEA-S
   - Adrenal metastases: DHEA/DHEA-S below reference range

3. **Adrenal Incidentalomas:**
   - LOW DHEA-S (<normal for age/sex): Sensitive and specific for subclinical Cushing's syndrome
   - 87.5% of patients with adrenocortical incidentalomas had low DHEA-S
   - Low DHEA-S suggests cortisol overproduction suppressing DHEA

4. **PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome):**
   - Elevated DHEA-S in ~20-30% of PCOS patients
   - Indicates adrenal androgen excess component
   - May respond to dexamethasone suppression

5. **Medications/Supplements:**
   - Exogenous DHEA supplementation will elevate DHEA-S
   - Insulin sensitizers (metformin) may lower DHEA-S in PCOS
   - Corticosteroids suppress DHEA-S production

6. **Chronic Illness:**
   - Chronic diseases (cancer, heart failure, chronic infections) lower DHEA-S
   - May be adaptive response or marker of disease severity
   - Bidirectional relationship: does low DHEA-S cause disease or vice versa?

7. **HPA Axis Dysfunction:**
   - Chronic stress may deplete DHEA-S over time
   - High cortisol:DHEA-S ratio indicates HPA axis dysregulation
   - Functional medicine focuses on ratio, not just absolute values

---

#### Common Confounders

1. **Age Mismatch:**
   - Using wrong reference range for patient's age
   - Comparing to general adult range instead of age-specific
   - **Solution:** ALWAYS use age- and sex-matched reference ranges

2. **Unreported Supplementation:**
   - Patient taking DHEA supplements without reporting
   - Over-the-counter availability makes this common
   - **Solution:** Specifically ask about OTC hormone supplements

3. **Lipemic/Hemolyzed Samples:**
   - Severe lipemia or hemolysis can interfere with immunoassays
   - **Solution:** Ensure proper sample handling, fast if required by lab

4. **Assay Variability:**
   - Different labs use different immunoassays
   - Reference ranges vary significantly between labs
   - **Solution:** Use same lab for serial monitoring

5. **Acute Illness:**
   - Acute severe illness can transiently lower DHEA-S
   - Not reflective of true baseline adrenal function
   - **Solution:** Retest after recovery from acute illness

6. **Pregnancy:**
   - DHEA-S decreases during pregnancy (placental metabolism)
   - Not interpretable in pregnant women
   - **Solution:** Test only in non-pregnant state

---

#### Clinical Interpretation Notes

**When DHEA-S is LOW:**

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency (pituitary dysfunction, hypopituitarism)
- Subclinical hypercortisolism (if adrenal incidentaloma present)
- Chronic stress/"adrenal fatigue" (functional medicine concept, controversial)
- Chronic illness (cancer, heart failure, chronic infections)
- Advanced age (normal aging)
- Medications (corticosteroids)

**Workup:**
- Morning cortisol (assess for Addison's if very low DHEA-S)
- ACTH stimulation test if adrenal insufficiency suspected
- Review medication list
- Assess for chronic diseases
- Consider pituitary MRI if secondary insufficiency suspected

**Functional Medicine Approach:**
- Optimize sleep (7-9 hours)
- Stress reduction (meditation, yoga, adaptogenic herbs)
- Nutrition: adequate calories, protein, healthy fats
- Exercise: moderate intensity (excessive can lower DHEA-S)
- Consider DHEA supplementation if age-appropriate levels cannot be achieved with lifestyle

**When DHEA-S is HIGH:**

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Androgen-secreting adrenal tumor (adenoma or carcinoma)
- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency)
- PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) - in women
- Exogenous DHEA supplementation

**Workup:**
- CT or MRI of adrenal glands (if >600 μg/dL)
- 17-hydroxyprogesterone (screen for CAH)
- Testosterone, androstenedione (assess androgen excess)
- Careful medication/supplement history
- In women: assess for signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities)

**Red Flags:**
- DHEA-S >600 μg/dL at any age WITHOUT supplementation → Image adrenals
- Rapid onset virilization in women → Urgent evaluation for malignancy
- Adrenal mass + elevated DHEA-S → High risk of carcinoma, requires oncology referral

---

**Functional Medicine Optimal Target Strategy:**

1. **Establish baseline:** Age- and sex-matched reference range
2. **Target upper 50th percentile** for longevity optimization
3. **Monitor trends:** Serial testing every 6-12 months
4. **Lifestyle first:** Sleep, stress, nutrition, exercise
5. **Supplementation:** If levels remain <25th percentile despite lifestyle optimization
   - Start low: Women 5-10 mg, Men 25 mg
   - Titrate based on symptoms and levels
   - Recheck in 3 months
   - Monitor for side effects: acne, hair loss (women), mood changes
6. **Caution in men (per 2025 data):** Don't over-supplement to supraphysiological levels
7. **Check hormone panel:** DHEA-S, testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, cortisol (comprehensive assessment)

---

**Important 2025 Update - Clinical Paradigm Shift:**

The 2025 Mendelian randomization study challenges traditional assumptions about DHEA-S supplementation:

- **Old paradigm:** Low DHEA-S causes mortality → Supplement to prevent death
- **New paradigm:** Low DHEA-S is MARKER of poor health, not necessarily the CAUSE
- **Clinical implication:** Focus on treating underlying diseases and optimizing health; DHEA-S may normalize as health improves
- **Supplementation role:** Still reasonable for symptom management (energy, mood, libido) and functional optimization, but NOT as primary longevity intervention
- **Evidence-based approach:** Observational data supports association; genetic data questions causation. More RCTs needed on hard endpoints (mortality, CVD events).

## CLINICAL PEARLS

### Sodium
- U-shaped curve: Both extremes are dangerous
- 138-142 mEq/L = sweet spot for longevity
- Higher sodium (>142) = marker of chronic dehydration
- Hydration is modifiable longevity factor
- Correction rate matters: Too fast = osmotic demyelination syndrome

### DHEA-S
- Most age-dependent hormone - MUST use age/sex-matched ranges
- Low levels = consistent mortality predictor in MEN (observational data)
- 2025 genetic data questions causation - may be marker, not cause
- Target: mid-to-upper quartile of age/sex-matched range
- Supplementation: 10-25 mg (women), 25-50 mg (men)
- >600 μg/dL = adrenal tumor until proven otherwise
- Postmenopausal women depend on DHEA for 90% of estrogen
