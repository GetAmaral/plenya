**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Evidence Base:** 2023-2026 Literature + Functional Medicine Sources

## 1. SELENIUM (Blood - Serum/Plasma)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

**Rationale:** Selenium demonstrates a classic U-shaped relationship with health outcomes. Both deficiency and excess lead to adverse health effects. Research consistently shows:
- Below optimal range: Increased cardiovascular mortality, cancer risk, immune dysfunction, thyroid disorders
- Optimal range: Maximized selenoprotein function, lowest all-cause mortality
- Above optimal range: Increased diabetes risk, cardiovascular events, toxicity symptoms (selenosis)

A 2021 study in hypertensive patients found the nadir of all-cause mortality at 136 µg/L and cardiovascular mortality at 130 µg/L, with increased risk at both lower and higher levels. A 2025 meta-analysis confirmed the U-shaped association between selenium status and mortality across multiple populations.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

**Primary Optimal Range:** 90-130 µg/L (serum/plasma)

**Functional Medicine Sources:**
- **OptimalDX (2024):** 70-121 µg/L (conservative range)
- **Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM):** 90-120 µg/L (physiological optimum)
- **Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M):** 100-130 µg/L (longevity focus)
- **European Food Safety Authority (2023):** Upper limit 255 µg/day intake

**Peak Selenoprotein Optimization:** 70-125 µg/L
**Longevity Sweet Spot:** 100-130 µg/L (lowest all-cause mortality)
**Safety Ceiling:** <150 µg/L (avoid exceeding)

---

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** µg/L (micrograms per liter)
**Alternative Units:**
- **µg/dL (micrograms per deciliter):** Multiply µg/L by 0.1
  Example: 100 µg/L = 10 µg/dL
- **nmol/L (nanomoles per liter):** Multiply µg/L by 0.01267
  Example: 100 µg/L = 1.267 nmol/L
  (Conversion factor based on selenium atomic weight: 78.96 g/mol)

**Common Lab Reporting:**
- USA: Typically µg/dL or µg/L
- Europe/International: nmol/L or µg/L
- Most functional medicine labs: µg/L

### Risk Stratification Levels (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (µg/L) | Range (µg/dL) | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **SEVERE DEFICIENCY** | <40 | <4.0 | Keshan disease (cardiomyopathy), Kashin-Beck disease (osteoarthritis), severe immune dysfunction, myocarditis, increased cancer risk, impaired T4→T3 conversion | Critical: <20 µg/L (medical emergency) |
| **MODERATE DEFICIENCY** | 40-69 | 4.0-6.9 | Compromised immune function, increased infection risk, thyroid dysfunction, oxidative stress, elevated cardiovascular disease risk, reduced cognitive function | Threshold: <70 µg/L (selenoprotein dysfunction begins) |

| **OPTIMAL** | 90-130 | 9.0-13.0 | **IDEAL RANGE:** Maximal selenoprotein function, lowest all-cause mortality, optimal immune function, best cardiovascular protection, thyroid health support | Sweet spot: 100-120 µg/L (peak health outcomes) |
| **ELEVATED** | 131-149 | 13.1-14.9 | Early excess, increased diabetes risk, potential cardiovascular concerns, mild toxicity risk, consider reducing supplementation | Upper safety: 150 µg/L (do not exceed) |
| **TOXICITY (SELENOSIS)** | ≥150 | ≥15.0 | Selenium toxicity: garlic breath odor, metallic taste, hair loss, nail brittleness/loss, GI symptoms (nausea, diarrhea), neurological symptoms (paresthesia, irritability), fatigue, joint pain | Toxic: ≥200 µg/L (acute toxicity risk, medical intervention required) |

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**
- **Elderly:** May require higher range (100-130 µg/L) for optimal cognition and immune function
- **Children:** Lower absolute values but maintain relative optimal range
- **Pregnancy/Lactation:** Increased requirements (60-70 µg/day intake)

**Context Dependencies:**

1. **Thyroid Function:**
   - Selenium essential for T4→T3 conversion (deiodinase enzymes)
   - Hypothyroid patients may benefit from upper optimal range (110-130 µg/L)
   - Autoimmune thyroiditis: Consider 100-200 µg/day supplementation

2. **Geographic Selenium Status:**
   - Low-selenium regions (Europe, China): Higher risk of deficiency
   - High-selenium regions (USA Great Plains, Venezuela): Toxicity risk
   - Adjust targets based on local soil selenium content

3. **Chronic Disease:**
   - Cancer patients: Target 100-130 µg/L (antioxidant support)
   - CVD patients: Maintain 90-130 µg/L (U-shaped curve awareness)
   - Diabetes: Avoid >130 µg/L (increased T2DM risk with excess)

4. **Mercury Exposure:**
   - Selenium protective against mercury toxicity
   - Consider upper optimal range with documented mercury exposure

**Common Confounders:**

- **Iron deficiency anemia:** May lower selenium levels
- **Smoking:** Reduces selenium status
- **Inflammatory conditions:** May increase selenium requirements
- **Dialysis:** Significant selenium loss, monitor closely
- **Parenteral nutrition:** Risk of deficiency without supplementation

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**

- **Narrow therapeutic window:** 40 µg/L difference between optimal and toxic
- **Supplement caution:** Brazil nuts (single nut = 50-90 µg), multi-nutrients
- **Bioavailability:** Selenomethionine (organic) > sodium selenite (inorganic)
- **Testing timing:** Stable marker, not significantly affected by recent intake
- **Red cell selenium:** Alternative marker for longer-term status (3-4 months)
- **Monitor glutathione peroxidase (GPx):** Functional selenium status indicator

**Monitoring Recommendations:**

- **Initial deficiency:** Recheck in 3 months after supplementation
- **Optimal maintenance:** Annual monitoring
- **High supplementation (>200 µg/day):** Check every 6 months
- **Signs of toxicity:** Immediate recheck and discontinue supplementation

## 2. SHBG (SEX HORMONE BINDING GLOBULIN)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (with significant gender/context differences)**

**Rationale:** SHBG exhibits a U-shaped relationship with metabolic and cardiovascular health, though the clinical implications differ at extremes:

**Low SHBG (More Common & Clinically Significant):**
- Strong association with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes
- Increased cardiovascular disease risk
- PCOS in women
- Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)
- Cancer risk elevation

**High SHBG:**
- Hyperthyroidism
- Malnutrition/anorexia nervosa
- Symptomatic hypogonadism (insufficient free testosterone/estrogen)
- Decreased bone mineralization, increased fracture risk

**Critical Note:** Low SHBG carries greater disease burden in modern populations due to obesity, metabolic syndrome epidemic, and insulin resistance. However, both extremes indicate pathology.

### Risk Stratification Levels - MEN

| Risk Level | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **SEVERE DEFICIENCY** | <15 | Critical metabolic dysfunction, very high T2DM risk, severe insulin resistance, high cardiovascular event risk, likely metabolic syndrome, consider underlying pathology (obesity, insulin resistance, liver disease) | Medical threshold: <12 nmol/L (urgent intervention) |
| **MODERATE DEFICIENCY** | 15-24 | High risk of metabolic syndrome, significant insulin resistance, elevated T2DM risk (especially <40 y.o. if <20 nmol/L), increased free testosterone but often with metabolic consequences, MAFLD risk | Age-specific: <20 nmol/L (<50 years), <25 nmol/L (≥50 years) |
| **SUBOPTIMAL** | 25-29 | Below optimal metabolic health, early insulin resistance signals, suboptimal hormone balance, increased visceral adiposity likely, not ideal for longevity | Functional threshold: <30 nmol/L (below ideal) |
| **OPTIMAL** | 30-50 | **IDEAL RANGE:** Best metabolic health, balanced free/bound testosterone, optimal insulin sensitivity, lowest cardiovascular risk, supports healthy aging | Sweet spot: 30-40 nmol/L (peak metabolic health) |
| **ELEVATED** | 51-65 | Mild elevation, may indicate hyperthyroidism, liver disease, advancing age (normal), or excessive SHBG-increasing factors; assess free testosterone | Upper age-appropriate: 55 nmol/L (≥50 years) |
| **HIGH** | >65 | Risk of symptomatic hypogonadism (low free testosterone despite normal/high total testosterone), hyperthyroidism screening indicated, malnutrition/chronic illness consideration, bone health monitoring | Clinical concern: >70 nmol/L (evaluate underlying cause) |

---

### Risk Stratification Levels - WOMEN (Premenopausal)

| Risk Level | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Critical Thresholds |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **SEVERE DEFICIENCY** | <20 | PCOS high probability, severe insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome likely, very high T2DM risk, hyperandrogenism (elevated free testosterone), anovulation risk, cardiovascular risk elevation | Medical threshold: <15 nmol/L (urgent PCOS/metabolic evaluation) |
| **MODERATE DEFICIENCY** | 20-39 | PCOS possible, significant insulin resistance, elevated free androgens, menstrual irregularities common, metabolic syndrome risk (especially <30 nmol/L), subfertility concerns | PCOS threshold: <40 nmol/L (sensitivity 0.75 for metabolic dysfunction) |
| **SUBOPTIMAL** | 40-59 | Below optimal hormonal balance, suboptimal metabolic health, may have mild insulin resistance or hyperandrogenism, not ideal for reproductive health | Functional threshold: <60 nmol/L (below ideal) |
| **OPTIMAL** | 60-100 | **IDEAL RANGE:** Best hormonal balance, optimal insulin sensitivity, healthy free estrogen/testosterone levels, best fertility outcomes, lowest metabolic risk | Sweet spot: 60-80 nmol/L (peak metabolic & reproductive health) |
| **ELEVATED** | 101-120 | Mild elevation, may indicate advancing age, hyperthyroidism, or normal variation; assess free hormone levels and symptoms | Age-related: Postmenopausal women naturally higher |
| **HIGH** | >120 | Risk of insufficient free hormones, hyperthyroidism screening indicated, anorexia/malnutrition consideration, bone health concerns (high levels in eating disorders) | Clinical concern: >140 nmol/L (evaluate underlying cause) |

---

### SHBG - CRITICAL GENDER-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

#### **Gender Differences:**

**Baseline SHBG Levels:**
- Women have ~2x higher SHBG than men (median ~66 nmol/L vs ~33 nmol/L)
- SHBG mRNA and protein expression higher in women
- Sex difference present from childhood (girls > boys)

**Hormonal Regulation:**
- **Increases SHBG:** Estrogen, thyroid hormone, growth hormone
- **Decreases SHBG:** Androgens, insulin, IGF-1, glucocorticoids
- This explains higher female baseline (estrogen-dominant)

---

#### **Age-Specific Considerations:**

**MEN:**
- **Pattern:** Linear increase with age
- **20-40 years:** Baseline 20-35 nmol/L
- **40-60 years:** Gradual rise 25-45 nmol/L
- **>60 years:** Continued rise 30-55+ nmol/L
- **Clinical Implication:** Age-related SHBG rise can mask testosterone deficiency (total testosterone appears normal, but free testosterone low)

**WOMEN:**
- **Pattern:** U-shaped trajectory
  - **20-40 years:** Highest reproductive years, 60-80 nmol/L
  - **40-60 years:** Decline to nadir 44-50 nmol/L (perimenopause, increasing insulin resistance)
  - **>60 years:** Rise again 50-100+ nmol/L (postmenopause, estrogen changes)
- **Clinical Implication:** Perimenopausal SHBG decline contributes to metabolic syndrome risk; postmenopausal rise normal

---

#### **Relationship with Free Testosterone:**

**Free Testosterone Calculation Methods:**

1. **Free Androgen Index (FAI)** - OUTDATED, NOT RECOMMENDED
   - Formula: (Total Testosterone [nmol/L] / SHBG [nmol/L]) × 100
   - Problem: Overestimates hyperandrogenism when SHBG is low
   - Issue: Non-linear relationship ignored

2. **Calculated Free Testosterone (cFT)** - PREFERRED METHOD
   - Uses Vermeulen equation or similar algorithms
   - Requires: Total testosterone + SHBG + albumin
   - Accuracy: Correlates well with gold standard (equilibrium dialysis LC-MS/MS)
   - Recommendation: Use cFT instead of FAI in clinical practice (2024 consensus)

**Clinical Significance:**
- **Low SHBG:** ↑ Free testosterone (more bioavailable) BUT ↑ insulin resistance
- **High SHBG:** ↓ Free testosterone (less bioavailable), risk of hypogonadism symptoms
- **PCOS:** Low SHBG + high total testosterone = very high free testosterone → hyperandrogenism

---

#### **Context: Metabolic Syndrome, PCOS, Insulin Resistance**

**Metabolic Syndrome:**

- **SHBG as Predictor:** Low SHBG independently predicts MetS (OR 0.42, p=0.01)
- **Mechanism:** SHBG inversely regulated by insulin (hyperinsulinemia → ↓ SHBG)
- **Threshold:** <40 nmol/L in men, <50 nmol/L in women
- **Evidence (2024-2025):**
  - Type 1 diabetes study: SHBG 51 nmol/L (with MetS) vs 79 nmol/L (without MetS)
  - SHBG decreases with each additional MetS component
- **Gender Dimorphism:** SHBG more sensitive for identifying MetS in boys than girls (children)

**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):**

- **Hallmark:** Low SHBG (<40 nmol/L) + hyperandrogenism
- **2025 Study Findings (European PCOS cohort):**
  - SHBG <40 nmol/L predicts metabolic dysfunction:
    - Sensitivity: 0.75 (75% detection rate)
    - Specificity: 0.82 (82% accuracy)
  - Women with SHBG <40 nmol/L:
    - Higher BMI: 34.1 vs 22.8 kg/m²
    - Greater insulin resistance: HOMA-IR 2.7 vs 0.9
  - SHBG cutoff 40 nmol/L distinguishes healthy vs disturbed metabolic profile
- **Clinical Use:** SHBG <40 nmol/L = early biomarker, therapeutic target
- **Free Testosterone:** Calculate cFT, not FAI (more accurate in low-SHBG states)
- **Treatment Target:** Improve insulin sensitivity → SHBG rises → free androgens decrease

**Insulin Resistance:**

- **Inverse Relationship:** ↑ Insulin resistance → ↓ SHBG (dose-response)
- **Mechanism:** Insulin suppresses hepatic SHBG production
- **HOMA-IR Correlation:** Positive correlation with SHBG across studies
- **Evidence (2024-2025):**
  - SHBG correlates with HOMA-S (insulin sensitivity)
  - Low SHBG = strong T2DM predictor (OR 0.10 for highest vs lowest quartile in men)
- **Clinical Application:** SHBG <40 nmol/L → Screen for insulin resistance, prediabetes

**Body Mass Index (BMI) Influence:**
- **Obesity:** ↑ BMI → ↓ SHBG (adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance)
- **Weight Loss:** ↓ BMI → ↑ SHBG (improves metabolic profile)
- **SHBG inversely correlates with visceral adiposity**

### Special Considerations

**Age Dependencies:**

- **Men:** SHBG increases ~1-2% per year after age 40
  - Use age-adjusted reference ranges (avoid misdiagnosing testosterone deficiency)
  - Free testosterone calculation essential in elderly (high SHBG may mask low free T)

- **Women:** U-shaped age trajectory
  - Premenopausal: Higher SHBG (60-80 nmol/L)
  - Perimenopausal: Decline (44-50 nmol/L) - metabolic syndrome risk period
  - Postmenopausal: Rise (50-100+ nmol/L) - normal physiology
  - Menopausal hormone therapy may further increase SHBG

- **Children:** SHBG higher in girls than boys from early age

**Context Dependencies:**

1. **Obesity/Body Composition:**
   - ↑ BMI → ↓ SHBG (strongest modifiable factor)
   - Visceral adiposity more impactful than subcutaneous
   - Weight loss intervention: Expect SHBG rise with metabolic improvement

2. **Dietary Factors:**
   - High protein, high fat diet → ↑ SHBG
   - Low protein, low fat diet → ↓ SHBG
   - Fiber intake → ↑ SHBG
   - Refined carbohydrates → ↓ SHBG (via insulin)

3. **Physical Activity:**
   - Regular exercise → ↑ SHBG (improves insulin sensitivity)
   - Sedentary lifestyle → ↓ SHBG

4. **Thyroid Function:**
   - Hyperthyroidism → ↑↑ SHBG (often >100 nmol/L)
   - Hypothyroidism → ↓ SHBG
   - Screen thyroid if SHBG markedly elevated without other cause

5. **Liver Disease:**
   - SHBG synthesized in liver
   - Cirrhosis/chronic liver disease → variable SHBG
   - NAFLD/MAFLD → typically ↓ SHBG (metabolic dysfunction)

6. **Medications:**
   - **Increase SHBG:** Estrogen therapy, oral contraceptives, anticonvulsants (phenytoin), thyroxine
   - **Decrease SHBG:** Androgens, anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids, progestins, growth hormone

**Common Confounders:**

- **Oral estrogen:** Dramatically increases SHBG (first-pass liver effect)
  - May artifactually lower free estrogen/testosterone
  - Transdermal estrogen has less effect

- **Pregnancy:** SHBG rises significantly (2-3x) - normal physiology

- **Chronic illness/inflammation:** May affect SHBG levels

- **Genetic factors:** SHBG gene polymorphisms influence baseline levels

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**

**When SHBG is Low (<40 nmol/L for men, <50 nmol/L for women):**
1. Screen for insulin resistance (fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c)
2. Assess metabolic syndrome components (waist circumference, BP, lipids, glucose)
3. Check liver function (AST, ALT - NAFLD screening)
4. Evaluate for PCOS (women: menstrual history, androgens, ovarian ultrasound)
5. Calculate free testosterone (use cFT, not FAI)
6. Assess body composition and lifestyle factors

**When SHBG is High (>65 nmol/L for men, >120 nmol/L for women):**
1. Screen for hyperthyroidism (TSH, free T4)
2. Assess nutritional status (eating disorders, malnutrition)
3. Calculate free testosterone/estrogen (risk of symptomatic hypogonadism)
4. Check for chronic illness or liver disease
5. Review medications (estrogen, anticonvulsants)
6. Consider bone density evaluation if chronically elevated

**Free Hormone Calculation Best Practices:**
- **ALWAYS calculate free testosterone** when SHBG abnormal
- Use validated calculators (Vermeulen equation or similar)
- Require total testosterone + SHBG + albumin
- Avoid Free Androgen Index (FAI) - inaccurate with low SHBG
- Consider direct free testosterone assay if discrepancy (though cFT preferred)

**Monitoring Recommendations:**

- **PCOS/insulin resistance:** Recheck every 3-6 months during treatment
- **Metabolic syndrome:** Annual monitoring
- **Stable/optimal range:** Every 1-2 years
- **Thyroid treatment:** Recheck 6-8 weeks after dose change
- **Weight loss interventions:** Recheck 3-6 months post-intervention

**Therapeutic Targets:**

- **Lifestyle interventions (primary):**
  - Weight loss (even 5-10% body weight improves SHBG)
  - Regular exercise (resistance + aerobic)
  - Mediterranean/low-glycemic diet
  - Adequate protein and healthy fats

- **Medical interventions:**
  - Metformin (PCOS, prediabetes) - improves insulin sensitivity, raises SHBG
  - Thiazolidinediones (limited use) - improve insulin sensitivity
  - Anti-androgens (spironolactone in PCOS)
  - Thyroid hormone optimization

## Clinical Decision Support

### Selenium Action Points

| Serum Selenium | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| <40 µg/L | **URGENT:** Investigate for deficiency diseases (Keshan, Kashin-Beck), supplement 200 µg/day, recheck in 4-6 weeks |
| 40-69 µg/L | **SUPPLEMENT:** 100-200 µg/day selenium, assess diet, recheck in 3 months |
| 70-89 µg/L | **OPTIMIZE:** Consider 50-100 µg/day supplementation, focus on selenium-rich foods (Brazil nuts, fish, eggs) |
| 90-130 µg/L | **MAINTAIN:** Optimal range, no supplementation if no deficiency risk factors |
| 131-149 µg/L | **REDUCE:** Discontinue supplements, reassess dietary intake, recheck in 3 months |
| ≥150 µg/L | **TOXICITY:** Stop all selenium supplements, evaluate symptoms, consider chelation if symptomatic, recheck in 4-6 weeks |

### SHBG Action Points (Men)

| SHBG (nmol/L) | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| <15 | **URGENT:** Comprehensive metabolic workup (insulin resistance, MetS, T2DM screen), lifestyle intervention, consider metformin |
| 15-24 | **HIGH RISK:** Screen for metabolic syndrome components, calculate free testosterone, aggressive lifestyle modification |
| 25-29 | **SUBOPTIMAL:** Assess insulin resistance, weight loss if BMI >25, increase physical activity |
| 30-50 | **OPTIMAL:** Maintain current health behaviors, annual monitoring |
| 51-65 | **ELEVATED:** Check free testosterone, screen for hyperthyroidism if >60, age-appropriate if elderly |
| >65 | **INVESTIGATE:** TSH/free T4, assess symptoms of hypogonadism, calculate free testosterone, evaluate nutrition/chronic illness |

### SHBG Action Points (Women)

| SHBG (nmol/L) | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| <20 | **URGENT:** PCOS evaluation (androgens, pelvic ultrasound), metabolic syndrome screen, insulin resistance assessment |
| 20-39 | **HIGH RISK:** Rule out PCOS, calculate free testosterone, lifestyle intervention, consider metformin if insulin resistant |
| 40-59 | **SUBOPTIMAL:** Optimize metabolic health, weight management, regular exercise, recheck in 6 months |
| 60-100 | **OPTIMAL:** Maintain current health behaviors, annual monitoring |
| 101-120 | **ELEVATED:** Check free estrogen/testosterone, age-appropriate if postmenopausal, screen thyroid if symptomatic |
| >120 | **INVESTIGATE:** TSH/free T4, assess for eating disorders/malnutrition, evaluate symptoms, calculate free hormones, bone density if chronic |
