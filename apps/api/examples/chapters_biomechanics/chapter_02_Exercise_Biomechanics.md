INTRODUCTION

"Mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the effect of forces on the motion of
bodies. It was the first branch of physics that was applied successfully to living systems,
primarily to understanding the principles governing the movement of animals" (Davidovits,
1975). In this chapter we are concerned with mechanical approaches to the understanding of
exercise, both from a static and from a dynamic viewpoint.
Although the emphasis of this chapter is on walking, running, and moving, there also are
treatments of strength, load-carrying, and muscular energy expenditure. The reader should
also note that companion material can be found in Chapter 5, Thermal Responses, since an
intrinsic part of biomechanical activities is the production of heat.
2.2

PHYSICS OF MOVEMENT

A great deal of understanding of movement can be obtained by consideration of
fundamentals. In this section, the human body is reduced to its very simplest form, and simple
conclusions result. As realistic complications are added, the analyses must become more
complicated as well. However, the conclusions drawn from these involved cases will not
necessarily give more insight. Thus we begin simply.
2.2.1

Equilibrium and Stability

Any body, including the human body, is in static equilibrium if the vectorial sum of both the
forces and torques acting on the body is zero. Any unbalanced force results in a linear
acceleration of body mass, and any unbalanced torque results in a rotational acceleration.
Thus for a body to be in static equilibrium,
∑ F =0

(2.2.1a)

∑T =0

(2.2.1b)

where F = vectorial forces, N
T = vectorial torques,2 N·m

Lever action, torques, and forces form the basis for much of the study of biomechanics.
Usually assumed to be positive for a clockwise rotation.

Figure 2.2.1 Body stability. The center of mass must be located over the support for stability. A wider
support increases stability. Here, the action of an unbalanced force F tends to topple the body with a
torque FH. Acting against this torque is the opposing torque WL. Increasing L increases the resistance to
toppling.

The weight of a mass can be considered to be a single force acting through a single point
called the center of mass. Body weight acting through its center of mass generally is used to
promote stability. That is, body weight can provide the balancing force or torque necessary to
maintain stability.
The position of the center of mass with respect to the base of support determines whether
the body is stable. A stable body has its center of mass directly over its support base (Figure
2.2.1). The wider the base, the more difficult it is to topple the body. The reason for this is
that the lateral distance between the center of mass and the point about which the body would
pivot should it topple is located at one side of the base and is increased for a wider base,
producing a higher restoring torque.
The center of mass of a human body is located at approximately 56% of a person's height
measured from the soles of the feet (Davidovits, 1975) and midway between the person's sides
and front-to-back. The center of mass can be made to shift by extending the limbs or by
bending the torso (see Table 2.2.1). When carrying an uneven load under one arm, the other
arm extends from the body to compensate and shift the center of mass of the body-load

combination back over the feet. At the same time, the torso bends away from the load and
body weight is shifted from the leg nearest the load so that the limb can help maintain stability
(Figure 2.2.2).
When performing dynamic exercise, some assistance can be obtained by temporarily
forcing the body to become unstable. Running, jumping, and diving are sports where
instability must be managed. While wrestling, weight-lifting, and fencing, stability must be
maintained. Shifting body position will produce the desired effect.
2.2.2

Muscles and Levers

Skeletal muscles consist of many thousands of parallel fibers, wrapped in a flexible sheath
that narrows at both ends into tendons (Davidovits, 1975). The tendons attach the muscles to
the bone. Most muscles taper to a single tendon; muscles with two tendons on one end are
called biceps and muscles with three tendons are called triceps.
Muscles usually are connected between adjacent movable bones. Their function is to pull
the two bones together.
Resting muscle tissue possesses an electrical potential difference across its cell
membranes (Figure 2.2.3). This resting transmembrane potential arises as a consequence of
the ionic charge distribution on both sides of the membrane (Mende and Cuervo, 1976).
Sodium is the chief extracellular cation, and potassium is the most plentiful intracellular


34

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

Figure 2.2.3 A transmembrane potential of - 90 mV is maintained by active mechanisms that require
energy from ATP. Sodium ions are pumped outside and potassium ions are pumped inside the cell
membrane. Chloride ions pass freely both ways, but large protein anions cannot escape through the cell
membrance.

cation. Chloride is the main extracellular anion, whereas relatively large organic acid anions,
to which the cellular membrane is impervious, are inside. A source of energy is required to
establish and maintain this resting transmembrane potential. Sodium ions that leak inside the
cell, due to a concentration difference across the membrane, are actively excluded. The result
of this ionic disequilibrium is about a - 90 mV potential3 difference across the membrane.
Whenever a nervous impulse reaches the muscle, a chemical transmitter is released at the
site of the conjunction of nerve and muscle, which causes the muscle membrane to become
much more pervious to sodium ions. The inrush of sodium actually reverses the resting
transmembrane potential, and it momentarily reaches a value of about + 20 mV (+ 30 mV in
neurons). Within about a millisecond, the resting value is reestablished.
This reverse polarization of the transmembrane potential travels from one location of the
muscle cell to another, in wavelike fashion. Muscular contraction is triggered by this
depolarization wave (see Sections 1.3.1 and 5.2.5).
Since muscles are capable only of contraction, the direction of movement of the bones to
which they are attached depends on their points of attachment. In this respect, the joint
between the bones acts as a fulcrum, and the muscle acts on a portion of the bone as a force
on a lever.
There are three classes of levers, illustrated in Figure 2.2.4 (Davidovits, 1975). In a class
1 lever the fulcrum is located between the applied force and the load. Examples of a class 1
lever are a crowbar and a seesaw. In a class 2 lever the load is between the fulcrum and the
force. A wheelbarrow is an example of a class 2 lever. In a class 3 lever, the applied force is
between the fulcrum and the load. A pencil writing on a sheet of paper is an example of this
class.
Equating the torques caused by the load and the applied force gives
FdF = WdW

(2.2.2)

The transmembrane potential is about -70mV in nerve cells and -90mV in skeletal muscle. Intracellular fluid is negative with
respect to extracellular fluid.

(2.2.3)

where F = applied force, N
W = load, N
dF = distance from the fulcrum to the point of application of the force, m
dW = distance from the fulcrum to the point of attachment of the load, m
The applied force will be less than the load if the distance between fulcrum and load is less
than the distance between fulcrum and the applied force. Although it may seem to be
advantageous to apply a force smaller than the load, this is not the way muscular attachment is
built.
Another property of levers is illustrated in Figure 2.2.5. When the load does move, the
distance the load moves compared to the distance the force moves is

LW dW
=
LF d F

(2.2.4)

where LW = distance through which the load moves, m
LF = distance through which the force moves, m

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

When both distances are divided by time, relative speeds are obtained:

sW dW
=
sF d F

(2.2.5)

where sW = speed of load movement, m/sec
sF = speed of force movement, m/sec
Muscles are capable of generating large forces of about 7 x 10 N per square meter of crosssectional area (Davidovits, 1975). They are not capable of moving far, and muscle efficiency
decreases as speed of contraction increases (see Sections 3.2.3, 4.2.3, and 5.2.5). Therefore,
many limb joints are built as class 3 levers to match the properties of muscle tissue (or viceversa).
Figure 2.2.6 is a diagram of the upper and lower arm and elbow. The biceps muscle is
attached as a class 1 lever. Calculations by Davidovits (1975) indicate that if the angle
between the upper and lower arms at the elbow is about 100º, with the lower arm horizontal,
then the biceps muscle exerts a force somewhat greater than 10 times the weight supported in
the hand. The reaction force that is exerted by the bone of the upper arm (humerus) on the
bones of the lower arm (ulna and radius) at the elbow is about 9.5 times the supported weight.
The force exerted on the joint can be significant. At the hip joint (Figure 2.2.7) the
reaction force is nearly 2.5 times the weight of the person. Limping shifts the center of mass
of the body more directly above the hip joint and decreases the force to about 1.25 times the
body weight. This is a significant reduction in force and demonstrates why persons with
injured hips limp the way they do.
Maximal expected torques that can be developed at the joints depend on several factors.

First of these is the distribution of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers in muscles of the
joint (see Section 1.3.1; Kamon, 1981). Second of these is the work history of the muscles,
where muscles composed largely of fast-twitch fibers can produce larger torques than muscles
composed mostly of slow-twitch fibers at all speeds of contraction before muscle exhaustion.
After muscle exhaustion, maximal torques are the same for the two muscle types (Kamon,
1981). Age and sex also influence maximum torque. Some of these torques are summarized in
Table 2.2.2. In general, women seem to be 60% as strong as men (Kamon and Goldfuss,
1978).

motion and rotational motion.

the distance through which it acts is required:

The difference between velocity and speed is that the former is a vector quantity (includes a direction and a magnitude) whereas
the latter is a scalar quantity (magnitude only).

Vertical jumps begin from a crouch (Figure 2.2.8). The legs push against the bottom
surface until the feet leave the surface, and the body continues to rise until decelerated to zero
velocity by gravity. The maximum height of the jump is the point when velocity reaches zero.
Energy performed by the legs to raise the body from the crouch (kinetic energy) is translated
into potential energy in the process of the jump. From a conservation of energy perspective,
Fc = W(c + h)

where F = force produced by the legs, N
W = body weight, N

Therefore,

(2.2.13)

Experimental measurements have shown that the force produced by the legs is roughly twice
the body weight (Davidovits, 1975). Thus

h=c

(2.2.14)

For an average person, the depth of the crouch is about 60 cm. The height of the jump is also
about 60 cm.
A much greater height ought to be attained by beginning the jump from a running start.
Horizontal kinetic energy can be converted into vertical potential energy, thus forming the
basis for an estimate of the height of the jump:
mgh =

h=

mv 2

v2
2g

(2.2.15a)

(2.2.15b)

Added to this estimate should be a considerable fraction of the 60 cm previously estimated as
the height boost that can be produced in a final pushoff by the legs just before jumping. Also,
note that the center of mass of the body is about a meter above the feet, and that by
repositioning the body during the high jump to a more nearly horizontal plane (with a net
external energy cost of very little because, as the lower body is being raised, the upper body is
lowered), a higher level can be cleared. We must subtract from our estimate a very small
amount of translational kinetic energy which cannot be converted into potential energy
because it is needed to jump over the bar. Therefore,
h=

v2
+1.4
2g

(2.2.15c)

The short-distance running speed of a good high jumper is about 8.2 m/sec (Davidovits,
1975). The estimate of height thus becomes 4.8 m.
This estimate for the high jump is about twice the high jump record. Furthermore, the
pole vault recorded is near 6.0 m. These facts demonstrate that the efficiency of transforming
translational kinetic energy into potential energy is much higher with the aid of a pole than
with the unaided foot.
If the vertical jump is performed in a weaker gravitational system, such as on the moon, a
greater height can be attained. However, the additional height is not proportional to the
decrease in weight. Because of the gravitational system, the maximum force produced by the
legs does not change, nor does the depth of the crouch change. Return to Equation 2.2.13:
hm ( F −Wm ) W ( 2W −Wm ) W
=
=
h ( F −W ) Wm ( 2W −W ) Wm
where hm = height of jump on the moon, m
Wm = weight of person on the moon, N

(2.2.16)


42

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

With one-sixth of the earth's gravity, the moon causes a person to weigh one-sixth what he
would on the earth (W/Wm = 6). Therefore, a person who jumps 60 cm on the earth will jump
6.6 m on the moon.
Energy considerations can also be used to calculate the height of a jump that will produce
bone fracture. When assuming bone to be an elastic material, the energy stored in this elastic
material is
2

E = K ( ∆L)
2

(2.2.17)

where K = spring constant, N/m
∆L = change in length from resting length, m
The spring constant is a property of an elastic material (analogous to a spring) which relates
force required to compress the spring to the compression distance:
F = K ∆L

(2.2.18)

Stress is defined as the force in a material divided by the cross-sectional area:
σ = F/A

(2.2.19)

where σ = stress, N/m2
F = force, N
A = cross-sectional area, m2
and strain is defined as the amount of compression or stretch divided by the original length:
ε = ∆L/L

(2.2.20)

where ε = strain, m/m
L = original material length, m
∆L = change in length, m
The ratio of stress to strain, called Young’s modulus (also called modulus of elasticity or
elastic modulus), is usually assumed to be constant5 and has been measured for many
materials:

where Y = Young’s modulus, N/m2
Young’s modulus for bone in compression is 1.4 x 1010 N/m2 (Davidovits, 1975).
Also measures is the maximum compressive stress that can be resisted without rupture.
For bone, this value is 108N/m2 (Davidovits, 1975).

For many biological materials, the ratio of stress to strain is not truly constant, usually becoming lower at higher rates of strain.

particular strain.

(2.2.23b)

An energy balance can now be written for the leg bones in compression. The energy

where h = height of the fall, m
A = total cross-sectional area of the bones of the legs, m2
L = length of the leg bones, m
W = body weight, N
σmax = maximum breaking stress, N/m2
Taking the combined length of the leg bones at about 90 cm and the combined area of the
bones in both legs at about 12 cm2, and assuming an average 686 N body weight (70 kg
mass), the allowable height of the jump is 56 cm. Obviously, jump heights greater than 56 cm
are safely made. But this does point to the fact that a great deal of energy is dissipated in
bone joints and in the redistribution of fall energy on landing.
Not only do the joints aid in protecting the bones from breaking, but they also possess an
amazing amount of lubrication, which keeps them from destruction. Since the center of mass
is not directly above the hip joint, the force exerted by the bones on the joints is about 2.4
times the body weight (see Figure 2.2.7a). The joint slides about 3 cm (0.03m) inside the
socket during each step. The friction force acting through this distance is the coefficient of
friction times the exerted force, or 2.4·µ·W. The energy expanded during each step is
E = FL = (2.4W)(µ)(0.03)

(2.2.25)

where µ = friction coefficient, dimensionless
Without lubrication, the coefficient of friction would be about 0.3 and the energy to be
dissipated during each step of a 686 N man would be nearly 15 N·m; the joint would be
destroyed. As it is, the joint is well lubricated and has a coefficient of friction of only 0.003,
reducing friction heat and wear to negligible values.

This centrifugal force component must be balanced by a force of equal magnitude and

Then, without friction,

(2.2.30)

The only way that any given banking angle can support various running speeds is by friction
to supply the otherwise unbalanced centrifugal force.
A runner rounding a curve, as in Figure 2.2.9, naturally leans into the curve. The reason
for this is that the resultant force Fn will pass through the center of mass of the body only if
the runner leans inward. If not, there will be an unbalanced torque acting on the body which
tends to topple the runner outward. The angle of the lean is the same as calculated by
Equation 2.2.30. For the speed of 6.7 m/sec (a 4 min mile) on a 15 m radius track, φ = 0.30
rad (17º). Notice that body weight does not influence this angle. Also to be noted is the fact
that the banking on running tracks must be tailored to the speeds expected to be run on them.
For simplistic analysis of walking, consider the legs as pendulums. However, simple
pendulums, with all the weight concentrated at the ends, are not a good representation of the
legs. The physical pendulum is more realistic because its weight is distributed along its length
(Figure 2.2.10).

(2.2.33)

For a 90 cm long leg, the period is 1.6 sec (Davidovits, 1975). If each walking step is
regarded as a half-swing (the time of the pendulum to swing forward), then the time for each
step is T/2. This is the most effortless walk; walking faster or slower requires additional
muscular exertion and is more tiring.
Walking speed is proportional to the number of steps in a given time, and the size of each
step is proportional to the length of the leg. Therefore,
L

where s = walking speed, m/sec
But, from Equation 2.2.33,

Therefore,

(2.2.34c)

Thus the speed of walking in a natural stride increases as the square root of the length of the
walker’s legs. Similarly, the natural walking speeds of smaller animals are slower than those
of larger animals.
The situation for running, however, is different. When running, the torque is produced
mostly by the muscles instead of gravity. Assume that the length of the leg muscles is
proportional to the length of the leg, the cross-sectional area of the muscles is proportional to
the length squared, and the mass of the leg is proportional to length cubed7:

Lm ∝ L

Am ∝ L2

(2.2.35b)

m ∝ L3

(2.2.35c)

where Lm = muscle length, m
Am = muscle area, m2
m = leg mass, kg
Maximum muscle force is proportional to the area of the muscle. Maximum muscle
torque is proportional to the product of the maximum force times the length of the leg:

Tmax ∝ FmL ∝ L3
7

(2.2.36)

Leg mass proportional to length cubed implies that body mass is proportional to its length cubed. Although we like to think this
is true, a least squares regression of ideal body weights, as published by the American Heart Association, with height for
medium-frame men, gives a dependence of mass on height to the 1.4 power.

Running speed is still proportional to the product of the number of steps per unit time and the
length of each step. Therefore,

(2.2.39)

This indicates that the maximum speed of running is independent of leg size. A fox, for
instance, can run at about the same speed as a horse (Davidovits, 1975).
This simple analysis, which we will see later needs considerable modification to reflect
reality, can be used to give an estimate of the energy expended during running. The legs are
assumed to pivot only at the hips and reach their maximum angular velocity as the feet swing
past the vertical position. Rotational kinetic energy at this point (Davidovits, 1975) is

Er = 1/2 I ω2

(2.2.40)

where Er = rotational kinetic energy, N·m
ω = angular velocity, rad/sec
and this energy is assumed to be supplied by the leg muscles during each running step. The
angular velocity can be calculated (Davidovits, 1975) from

s
ω = max
L

(2.2.41)

where smax = leg speed with the leg in the vertical position, m/sec
= speed of running
Energy calculated using Equation 2.2.40 must be divided by muscular efficiency (about 20%)
to obtain total energy expenditure. Using some very simplifying assumptions, Davidovits
(1975) calculated the energy of running for a 70 kg person with 90 cm long legs with 90 cm
step lengths to be 100 kN·m (24 kcal) when running 1.6 km (1 mile) in 360 see (6 min). This
compares to a value of 1352 N·m/sec (19.4 kcal/min) energy expenditure from Table 2.3.1.
The conclusion of this exercise is that there is a good deal more to calculating the energy of
running than given in this simple example.

of walking, 12 min of cycling, 9 min of swimming, 5 min of running, and by 78 min of
reclining. This indicates that running is the most energy-intensive exercise among the five.
However, with that same energy expenditure, a walker will cover a distance of about 1.8 km,
the cyclist will cover a distance of about 4.8 km, the swimmer will go only 360 m, the runner
will travel 2.0 km, and the recliner will not travel at all. Clearly, there is a huge difference
between the energy expended on these different tasks. Why this should be so is the topic of
this discussion.
The case of the cyclist is most interesting. The cyclist encumbers himself with the extra
weight of the apparatus, but he obviously, gains a great deal by being able to travel
substantially farther on the same amount of energy compared to walking or running (which
have nearly equal distances). We previously noted the special case of swimming (Section 1.2)
and the additional energy required to overcome viscous drag on the body. Returning to the
case of bicycling, what is it about the bicycle that makes locomotion with it so highly
efficient?
Tucker (1975) considered this and other forms of movement. In his article he proposed,
as an index of the cost of transport,
CT = Pi /sW

(2.3.1)

where CT = cost of transport, dimensionless
Pi = input power, N·m/sec
s = speed of movement, m/sec
W = body weight, N
The cost of transport really involves the rate of energy usage moving at an appropriate speed.
Because there may be substantial differences in body weight between animals to be
compared,8 the cost of transport includes the weight factor. The result is a dimensionless
quantity that can be used to compare different modes of exercise.
The cost of transport for a given animal will vary with speed. If the animal does not
move, the cost of transport will be infinite because speed is zero, but a small amount of
maintenance energy (see Section 5.2.5) is still supplied. At very rapid speeds, the energy cost
is very high due to friction and inertia of various body parts. In Section 2.2.3 we saw that
walking and running speeds could be related to the natural periods of pendulums. Faster
speeds require the use of additional forcing energy. Thus at very high speeds, as at low
speeds, the cost of transport becomes very high. In between, there will be a minimum power
expenditure at some point.
The cost of transport will also achieve a minimum, but generally at a higher speed than
the power expenditure minimum. For a constant animal weight, the minimum cost of transport
will be determined by the ratio of Pi/s, which is equivalent to determining the minimum
graphically as the point at which a line through the origin of a graph for Pi and s is tangent to
the power curve. Figure 2.3.1 shows this minimum for flight of a budgie (budgerigar parrot).
In Figure 2.3.2 are plotted minimum costs of transport for a variety of runners, fliers,
swimmers, and other forms of human locomotion. Over 12 orders of magnitude of body mass
are represented, and minimum costs of transport vary widely.
The data in Figure 2.3.2 cluster along three general lines of classification: swimmers,
fliers, and walkers (or runners), with the minimum costs of transport for swimmers less than
those for fliers and for fliers less than those for walkers. Walking, therefore, is a
comparatively inefficient way of moving about.
Cycling has a minimum cost of transport about one-fourth that of walking,9 which is why
a cyclist is willing to assume the burden of the extra weight of the bicycle. Human swimmers,
on the other hand, have a minimum cost of transport nearly six times that of human walkers.
8

Or the body weight of a given animal may change substantially over a short time. Some migrating birds use up to 25% of their
body weight as fuel between feeding periods (Tucker, 1975).
9
A 686 N man (mass of 70 kg) achieves his minimum cost of transport while walking at about 1.75 m/sec (3.85 mi/hr). The
metabolic cost of walking at this speed is 452 N·m/sec and his cost of transport is 0.376. By comparison, he expends 1122
N·m/sec while jogging at 3.5 m/sec (7.7 mi/hr) and his cost of transport is 0.467.

transport is found at the point of tangency of the curve and the dashed line. (Redrawn with permission

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

Many cars and airplanes have costs of transport worse than walking animals of equivalent
mass, but tractor trailer trucks are nearly as efficient as walking animals of equivalent mass (if
they existed!).
A sparrow possesses a mass and metabolic rate equivalent to a mouse but flies nearly 10
times faster than the mouse runs. The sparrow's minimum cost of transport is about 10 times
less than that for a mouse.
Tucker (1975) observed that smaller terrestrial animals almost never migrate, but smaller
birds often do. Only larger mammal species, such as caribou, bison, and large antelopes,
migrate. Figure 2.3.2 shows a horizontal line at a cost of transport of 2.0. Animals with lower
costs of transport have usually been observed as migratory species, whereas animals above the
line have not. Apparently the costs of transport are too high for migration if they are above
2.0.10
The statement of muscular efficiency, at least for the larger muscles, being about 20%, is
made several times in this book (Sections 1.3, 2.2, 3.2.3, 4.2.3, 5.2.5). However, considering
an act of movement as a whole, mean muscular efficiency often is much lower than this and
may approach zero. Such is the case with walking on a level surface.
Muscle power is used, in general, for three purposes: (1) to support the body weight, (2)
to overcome aerodynamic drag, and (3) to perform mechanical work. Total input power equals
muscle power plus power diverted for nonmuscular purposes:

Pi − Pnm =

Pspt + Pd + Pw

η

(2.3.2)

Pi = input power, N·m/sec
Pnm = nonmuscular power, N·m/sec
Pspt = power to support body weight, N·m/sec
Pd = power to overcome drag, N·m/sec
Pw = power to perform external mechanical work, N·m/sec
η = muscular efficiency, dimensionless
Rearranging Equation 2.3.2 to obtain mean muscular efficiency:

where

η=

Pspt + Pd + Pw
Pi − Pnm

(2.3.3)

For walkers or runners, the power required to support the body weight is very small. So is
aerodynamic drag. Since a walker or runner on the level does not raise his body weight,11
external work is zero. Therefore, mean muscular efficiency for walking and running
approaches zero.
Birds do not have the same efficiencies while flying. They must support their body
weights with their wing muscles; going faster, they have higher amounts of aerodynamic drag;
and they perform external work when they move their wings through the air. Their mean
muscular efficiencies are close to 20%.
Why should mean muscular efficiency of walking be so low, and what happens to the
input energy? While walking, the center of mass of the body is continually moving up and
down. The muscles actively perform external work to raise the body weight, but they cannot
recover the potential energy when the center of mass falls. Instead, the muscles act against the
body weight by decelerating it. When muscles shorten and produce a force during shortening,
they produce external work; when muscles stretch but produce a force against an externally
10

Notice that helicopters and F105 fighter planes could migrate, should they be so inclined.
We are talking here about raising or lowering body weight over the entire walking or running cycle. During the cycle, however,
body weight does rise and fall considerably.

applied force, they produce negative external work (work is done on the muscle; see Section
5.2).12 This stretching of active muscles, attempting to shorten but not producing enough force
of their own to overcome the externally applied force, occurs during the decelerating phase of
walking. Part of the walking time is spent by muscles producing external work, and part of the
walking time is spent by work being done on the muscles. The former is characterized by a
positive muscular efficiency and the latter by a negative muscular efficiency. Mean muscular
efficiency for the entire act is about zero.13
If there were some way of storing mechanical energy at the appropriate points in the
walking cycle, it could be recovered to aid in performing other work and muscular efficiency
would rise. One way of doing this would be to store energy in an elastic medium. But humans
have not developed a very effective elastic medium in the course of their evolution and thus
cannot use this mechanism.14 The energy which is not stored becomes useless heat.
There are other ways of handling the excess of external mechanical energy without
elastically storing it. One alternative is to prevent the stretching of active muscles by
converting the downward velocity component of the body's center of mass into an upward
component later in the walking cycle. This mechanism applies a force to the center of mass at
right angles to its direction of motion. When the force is at right angles to the displacement,
the muscles that supply the force can neither do work nor have work done on them. The
velocity is changed at no expense to muscular work.

Figure 2.3.3 A wing converts horizontal movement into vertical lift. Here the net force F acting on the
wing is decomposed into a horizontal FH and vertical Fv component.
12
Kinesiology is the study of human movement, and biomechanics is the subdiscipline that relates to neuromusculoskeletal aspects
of that movement (Winter, 1983). Kinesiologists usually use the term "concentric" contraction for muscles shortening while
producing positive external work. They use the term "eccentric" contraction for muscles shortening and producing negative
muscular work.
13
Alexander (1984) compares the changes in energy and speed during walking and running to alternately braking and accelerating
while driving a car. The average speed can be held to the same value as during steady driving, but the use of energy in the form of
gasoline is much greater this way. The difference lies in the greater dissipation of energy as heat while braking and accelerating,
and the resulting efficiency is very low.
14
This is true for the case of walking. For running, however, there is a considerable amount of elastic energy storage (see Section
2.4).


54

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

An example of this is the pole used by the pole vaulter. The vaulter runs at a high speed
and thrusts the pole into a box in the ground. As long as the pole is not exactly horizontal, a
component is developed in the pole which is perpendicular to the direction of running. This
component lifts the vaulter without a vertical component of muscular work required.
A wing also performs this function. A wing is usually thin and tilted (Figure 2.3.3). The
tilt enables a vertical force component to be developed from horizontal movement. With
wings, the flying animal can change the downward motion of its center of mass into a forward
motion without stretching elastic structures or active muscles. Tucker (1975) provides a
dramatic example of the benefits of developing this perpendicular force. He considers the
results of dropping a pigeon and a rat from a high place. The pigeon merely extends its wings
and the perpendicular force changes its motion from vertical to horizontal. The rat, however,
must absorb all the developed kinetic energy at the bottom of the fall by stretching elastic
structures and active muscles, probably with extremely damaging effect.
Active muscle stretching can also be prevented by precluding the vertical movement of
the center of mass of the body. Many fishes achieve this end by balancing the force of gravity
with the buoyancy of their swim bladders. Millipedes, with their large number of legs, can
support their centers of mass at all times. The extreme of this strategy leads to the wheel. The
wheels of a bicycle stabilize the position of the rider's center of mass, and even pedaling while
standing up does not result in the stretching of active muscles because when the center of
mass falls the motion is translated into horizontal movement. By using external machinery
humans can achieve the muscular efficiencies that swimming and flying animals naturally
accomplish.
2.4

WALKING AND RUNNING

Moving about by walking and running has been the object of much study. In this section we
proceed from the simplest of biomechanical energetic models to theories about control of
these processes to experimental correlations of data.
2.4.1

Basic Analysis

Walking is a natural movement in which at least one foot is on the ground at all times (Figure
2.4.1)15 Because each foot touches the ground for slightly more than half the time, there are
stages when both feet are simultaneously on the ground (Alexander, 1984). While stepping,
the leg remains nearly straight, and, the position of the center of mass of the body is therefore
highest when the leg is vertical and the body passes over the supporting foot. Contrarily, the
body is lowest when both feet are touching the ground.
Running is a different mode of locomotion in which each foot is on the ground less than
half the time (Figure 2.4.2). There are stages of running during which neither foot is on the
ground. The runner travels in a series of leaps, with the center of mass of the body at its
highest in midleap. Its lowest point occurs when the trunk passes over the supporting foot,
and the supporting leg is bent at this stage. Walking and running are therefore characterized
by many dissimilarities, with the major resemblance between the two being forward motion
propelled by the legs.
The transition between walking and running occurs at fairly predictable speed of about
2.5 m/sec (6 mi/hr) for normal-sized adults (Alexander, 1984). Why this should be so can be
shown easily by a simple model of walking.
As illustrated by Figure 2.4.3, the walker sets a foot on the ground ahead of himself and,
while keeping the leg straight, propels himself forward with a speed v. His hipjoint thus
moves along an arc of a circle centered on the foot. For purposes of this simple model, the
legs will be considered to be sufficiently light that their masses can be ignored compared to
15

Except for race walking, where, it has been found, there is a very short time during which neither foot has ground contact.


WALKING AND RUNNING

55

Figure 2.4.1 Four successive stages of a walking stride. In the first stage the trailing foot leaves the
ground and the front foot applies a braking force. In the second stage the trailing foot is brought forward
off the ground and the supporting foot applies a vertical force. In the third stage the trailing foot provides
an acceleration force. In the last stage, both feet are on the ground, with the trailing foot pushing forward
and the front foot pushing backward.

Figure 2.4.2 Four stages of running. Braking and pushing forces are exerted by the feet much as in
walking, but much of the otherwise lost energy is stored between the first two stages in the form of
elastic strain in the tendons. This energy is then released between the second and fourth stages. During
the last stage, no feet are touching the ground; therefore, the opposing forces generated by the feet during
the last stage of walking are not present.

depending on the length of the leg. (Adapted and redrawn with permission from Alexander, 1984.)

the trunk, and therefore the body center of mass will occupy a fixed position on the trunk.
Hence the center of mass will move along an arc of the same radius as that of the hip joint.
Centripetal force can be calculated from Equation 2.2.26:

Fc =

mv 2
r

(2.2.26)


56

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

where Fc = centripetal force, N
m = body mass, kg
v = tangential velocity, m/sec
r = arc radius, m
A point moving with speed v along an arc of a circle will have an acceleration toward the
center of the circle:

F
v2
=a=
m
r

(2.4.1)

where a = acceleration, m/sec2
When the center of mass is at its highest, this acceleration will be directed vertically
downward. Since the walker cannot pull himself downward, his vertical acceleration is limited
to the free fall acceleration of gravity:

v2
≤g
r

(2.4.2a)

v ≤ gr

(2.4.2b)

or

where g = gravitational acceleration, 9.8 m/sec2
With a typical leg length of 0.9 m, maximum walking speed is about 3 m/sec, close to the
observed 2.5 m/sec in adults. Children, who have shorter legs than adults, break into running
at lower forward speeds. These results confirm the analysis resulting in Equation 2.2.34c.
Race walkers exceed this maximum speed, however, traveling about 4 m/sec (Figure
2.4.4). The trick that makes high walking speeds possible is to bend the lower part of the back
during walking, thus sticking the pelvis out and lowering the center of mass of the body
relative to the hip joint. The center of mass no longer moves in arcs of radius equal to the
length of the legs, but in arcs of larger radius. There is less rising and falling, and higher
speeds are possible.16
More detailed analysis of walking has shown that the simplified approach given
previously may be misleading. McMahon (1984) summarizes six movements during walking
which modify the gait:
1.

Compass gait. This is the basic walk characterized by flexions and extensions of the
hips and illustrated in Figure 2.4.3. The legs remain stiff and straight.

Figure 2.4.4 During race walking the center of mass of the body is kept lower than in ordinary walking
by the bending of the back and the tilting of the hips. Because the center of mass rises less, higher speeds
are possible compared to ordinary walking.
16
It has also been reported that women expend less energy than men walking at the same speed. Presumably this is because of
shorter steps taken by women, with consequent smaller fluctuation of vertical height of the pelvis (Booyens and Keatinge, 1957)

Pelvic rotation. The pelvis rotates around a vertical axis through the center of the
body. The amplitude of this rotation is about ± 3° during normal walking speeds and
increases at high speeds. The effect of this motion is to increase the effective length
of the leg, producing a longer stride and increasing the radius of the arcs of the hip,
giving a flatter, smoother movement.
Pelvic tilt. The pelvis tilts so that the hip on the side with the swinging leg falls
lower than the hip on the opposite side. The effect of this movement is to make the
trajectory arcs still flatter.
Stance leg knee flexion. By bending the knee of the leg supporting the weight, the arc
is made flatter yet.
Plantar flexion of the stance ankle. The sole, or plantar surface of the foot, moves
down and an ankle of the stance leg flexes just before the toe lifts from the ground.
A result of this is that the leg muscles can produce the forces necessary to swing the
leg forward during the next phase, but it also results in an effective lengthening of
the stance leg during the portion of the arc when the hip is falling. The hip thus falls
less than it would without this movement.
Lateral displacement of the pelvis. The body rocks from side to side during walking,
with a lifting of the swing leg.

These motions make walking a much more complex process than the simplified models
to this point would suggest. The result of these motions is that walking, although still energy
inefficient, is not as inefficient as it would be without them.
Results of calculations of expended power made from respiratory gas measurements are
seen in Figure 2.4.5. We have already discussed cycling relative to running, and it is not
surprising to see that cyclists expend less energy at any given speed than do runners. Power

Figure 2.4.5 Power required for walking, running, and cycling by an adult male. Curves for walking and
running intersect at about 2.3 m/sec and show that walking is more efficient below the intersection and
running is more efficient above. Cycling is more efficient because, presumably, the body does not rise
and fall as much as with walking and running. (Redrawn with permission from Alexander, 1984).

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

required for walking begins at a low value at low speeds (we would expect there to be a
minimum in the curve, based the discussion of Section 2.2.3) and rises rapidly to moderate
power levels at higher speeds.
Running power begins at moderate levels and rises less slowly than walking at yet higher
speeds. An intersection of the walking and running curves occurs at about 2.5 m/sec. If
walking is continued beyond this speed, there will be a higher expenditure of energy than if
the person switched to running. Similarly, if running is begun before 2.5 m/sec, a higher
amount of energy will be expended than if the person walked. It appears that the switch from
walking to running occurs because of energy considerations. There is a gradual shift in the
walking gait to maintain an optimal energy expenditure (Alexander, 1984) until the abrupt
changeover to running to again maintain an optimal energy expenditure.
Human running uses less energy than might be expected because of elastic energy
storage. Between the first and second stages of a running stride (Figure 2.4.2) the body is both
slowing and falling, simultaneously losing kinetic and potential energy (Alexander, 1984).
This energy must be restored between the third and fourth stages. If the energy lost was not
stored somewhere, the metabolic energy required from the muscles would be about 1.8 times
the actual energy consumption for slow running and 3.0 times the actual consumption for fast
running (Alexander, 1984).
Energy is stored by elastic deformation of the muscles and tendons. Muscles may be
stretched about 3% of their length before they yield and the energy cannot be recovered
elastically. Tendons can stretch about 6%) before breaking (Alexander, 1984). Although
elastic energy can be stored in each of these, the tendons are probably the most important
structures for energy storage. The ligaments and tendons in the soles of the feet and the
Achilles tendon are likely the most important site of energy storage during each running step
(Alexander, 1984).
Quadripedal animals have one mode of locomotion, besides walking and running, that
humans do not: they gallop at high speed. Galloping involves bending movements of the back
which briefly store leg kinetic energy fluctuations as elastic energy, contributing to overall
efficiency (Alexander, 1988). These animals appear to have two transitional power points, one
from walking to running or trotting and another from running to galloping.
2.4.2

Optimal Control of Walking

Walking has long been recognized as one bodily function that appears to have some built~in
optimization operating (see also Sections 3.4.3 and 4.3.4). Walking, for instance, appears to
occur at a speed that minimizes the rate of energy expenditure of the body. This can be simply
shown from the empirical observation that power consumption of walking, as measured by
oxygen consumption, depends on walking speed (Dean, 1965: Milsum. 1966):

ED = a + bs 2

(2.4.3)

where ED = rate of energy usage (or power), N·m/sec
a, b = constants, N·m/sec and N·sec/m
s = walking speed, m/sec
Average power per unit speed is
ED / s = a / s + bs

(2.4.4)

This represents an average power with two components, one linearly increasing and one
hyperbolically decreasing (Figure 2.4.6). Minimum average power can be found by taking the
derivative of ED / s and setting the derivative equal to zero:

d 
−a
(E / s) = 2 + b = 0

Figure 2.4.6 Walking appears to occur at a speed very close to the optimum based on average power
consumption. Two components of average power, one increasing with speed and the other decreasing
with speed, make possible a minimum average power.

s= a / b

(2.4.6)

where s = optimum speed, m/sec
Biochemical models describing walking and running are necessarily complex, not
conceptually but parametrically. As noted by Winter (1983), model inputs of muscle
electromyographic signals are many for relatively simple movements. Similarly, model
outputs of body segment motions, each with 3 degrees of freedom and 15 variables of forces
and moments, can soon become overwhelming. It is no wonder, then, that most modelers have
greatly oversimplified, constrained, or limited conditions for their models in order to deal with
these problems (Onyshko and Winter, 1980; Siegler et al., 1982).
All this is not necessarily bad, however. Depending on the use of the model, a simplified
artificial model may be preferred to a complex realistic model. This preference is especially
true if the model is to be used to impart understanding of general patterns rather than to
diagnostically treat individual malfunctions. Biomechanical models, used to identify causes of
abnormal gait patterns or to improve competitive running performance, are necessarily very
complex models. Since the objective for including models in this book is to aid general
understanding through mathematical description (see Section 1.1), models chosen for
inclusion are of the general or simplistic type.
There are many reasons for developing biomechanical models of walking and running.
Pierrynowski and Morrison (1985a, b) developed theirs to predict muscular forces; Williams
and Cavanagh (1983) and Morton (1985) developed theirs to predict power output during
running; Greene's model (1985) has applications to sports; Dul and Johnson (1985) developed
a descriptive kinematic model of the ankle; and Hatze and Venter (1981) used their models to
investigate the effects of constraints on computational efficiency. Reviews by King (1984)
and Winter (1983) summarize many recent modeling attempts.

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

The one model chosen to be highlighted here uses stepping motion as the object of the
model and includes control aspects as well as mechanical descriptions (Flashner et al., 1987).
In this model is postulated a hypothetical, but nevertheless plausible, hierarchical structure of
stepping control.
The hierarchy of control, diagramed in Figure 2.4.7, includes both open- and closed-loop
components. In general, Flashner et al. postulated a system that normally determines, based on
previous experience, the trajectory of a step to be taken. This is used as an open-loop
procedure during stepping. Only when the controller determines that the trajectory is not
proceeding as planned does it take corrective action.
For instance, if an object stands in the way of the step, the leg and foot must move in
such a way as to clear the object. Presumably the individual, over the years, has learned how
to optimally perform this task, The trajectory that has been stored from previous trials is then
used to program hip, leg, and foot motion. The action is quick and sure as long as nothing
unexpected happens. The controller samples sensors in the leg to determine if the intended
trajectory is being achieved. This sampling may occur at a slower or faster rate, depending on
the needs of the controller.
If conditions are found to be not as anticipated (for instance, if heavier shoes are worn or
the object moves), feedback control is used to correct the intended action (for instance,
muscle forces are increased or activity times are changed). Since feedback control is slower
than feedforward control, and feedback control does not effectively use past experience (at
least control with constant coefficients, or nonadaptive control), feedback is used only when
required.

Figure 2.4.7 Hierarchical control of a stepping motion. The decision to perform the motion results in a
trial trajectory given to the leg. Sampled data from the leg are sent to the interactive control unit, where it
is determined whether or not to send correction torques to the leg to overcome unforeseen disturbances.
(Adapted from Flashner et al., 1987.)


WALKING AND RUNNING

61

The highest level of control decides about task performance: to step or not to step, to
change task strategy for feedforward or feedback control units. The interactive control unit is
activated only when corrections to the preplanned movement are needed. This is the site of
feedback control.
At a lower level comes the preplanned control unit, wherein are stored optimal
trajectories parameterized by relevant variables of motion such as step height, step length, and
step duration (or, more likely, muscle forces and durations).
The leg dynamics level includes both sensing and activation. Its outputs are used by both
the feedforward and feedback control units, and it receives input information from both
control units.
During learning the interactive control unit is constantly active. The preplanned control
unit determines a candidate trajectory. Joint angles and control torques are calculated and sent
to the leg dynamics unit. Some performance criterion is calculated and stored. Over the course
of the learning period the task is repeated many times with different candidate trajectories.
Each of these yields a different value for the performance index. The trajectory with the most
desirable (usually the maximum or minimum) cost or performance index is the trajectory that
is remembered.
Performance criteria17 for the task may include any number of aspects. Minimizing time,
energy, peak force, or any combination of these is a possible performance criterion. In
addition, there are constraints, such as limits to the force of contact with the ground,
velocities, and accelerations. These must be included in the model formulation.
Figure 2.4.8 is a diagram of the dynamic leg model. The leg starts in position 1, fully
extended. As it moves to position 2 in midswing the hip and knee are bent. Flashner et al.
consider ankle bending only when the foot touches the ground. Hip height decreases but the
foot is raised to clear the object. Upon landing, the foot again raises the hip and both hip and
knee ankles return to their initial values.
Flashner et al. considered cycloidal velocity profiles for hip and knee joints:

θDH = C1 (ω − ω cos ω t )

(2.4.7a)

θDK = C2 (ω − ω cosω t )

(2.4.7b)

where θDH = time rate of change of hip angle, rad/sec
θDK = time rate of change of knee angle, rad/sec
ω,C1,C2 = constant parameters, whose values are chosen to match experimental data,
rad/sec
Cycloids have the advantage that their first and second time derivatives vanish at the
beginning (ωt = 0) and end (ωt = 2π) of the cycle. Experimental evidence suggests that the
smooth transition from a stationary state to a moving state and back again requires both
velocity and acceleration to be zero. Cycloids also introduce no more new parameters than do
sines or cosines, and, once hip motion is specified, all other angles, positions, velocities, and
accelerations are determined.
Kinematic equations can be derived for all segments of the model. Flashner et al.
presented these for the foot:

17

XF = XH+ LTH sin θH – LSH sin Θ

(2.4.8a)

YF = YH – LTH sin θH – LSH cos Θ

(2.4.8b)

C cos Θ
XC F = XC H + LTH θCH cosθ H − LSH Θ

d t  ∂ q i  ∂ q i

(2.4.12)

where ‹ = system Lagrangian

qi = generalized coordinates, m or rad
Qi = generalized forces, N or N·m
Ci = constraints, N or N·m
For Flashner et al.’s model, the coordinate vector is
q = [q1 q2 q3 q4]T = [XH YH θH θK]T

(2.4.13)

Q = [Q1Q2Q3Q4]T = [FHXFHYTHTK]T

(2.4.14)

and the force vector is

where FHX, FHY = force component acting on the hip, N
TH, TK = torques acting at hip and knee joints, N·m
The constraint vector is
C = J(q)λ

(2.4.15)

where J(q) = Jacobian matrix19 that relates the Cartesian coordinates of mass centers to
generalized coordinates qi
λ = vector of length to be determined by the system of constraints
During the swing phase of stepping there are no constraints on the motion of the leg.
During the landing phase of stepping the motion of the foot is constrained by the surface of
the ground. Flashner et al. introduce these constraints by
XF = 0
YF = 0

(2.4.16)

These conditions were used to derive equations of motion for the swing and landing phases.
Flashner et al. (1987) fitted their equations to experimental data as seen in Figure 2.4.9. It
can be seen from the figure that the agreement is quite close. Because these data were used as
the basis for model calibration, the fit would be expected to be very good as long as the model
had general validity.20 The conclusion which can be reached, therefore, is that the model has
sufficient capacity to reproduce reality in very limited circumstances. Whether the model is a
good description of the actual control of stepping and whether the model is a good predictor
of other data to which it has not been calibrated have yet to be determined.
18
Any system of equations which must be solved subject to certain constraints is a candidate for Lagrange's method. Constraints
are introduced into the equation set using a series of parameters called Lagrange multipliers. See Appendix 4.1.
19
The Jacobian matrix contains elements each of which is a partial derivative of a coordinate in one system with respect to a
coordinate in another system. All such elements ∂xi / ∂qi are included.
20
Flashner et al. (1987) show closer agreement to their data when the cycloidal motion of the hip is modified using fitting
techniques.

Experimental Results

Bassett et al. (1985) measured the oxygen cost of running, comparing overground and
treadmill running. They found no statistical difference between these two types of running,
either on a level surface or on a 5% uphill grade. Level running gave regression lines as
follows for treadmill:
VO 2 = 2.22m(10–7 s – 10–8),

s ≤ 4.77 m/sec

(2.4.17)

and for overland running:
VO 2 = 2.02m [10–7 s + (2.65 x 10–8)],

s ≤ 4.77 m/sec
3

where VO 2 = oxygen consumption, m /sec
m = body mass, kg
s = running speed, m/sec
They also reported that the additional oxygen cost caused by air resistance is
∆ VO 2 = 3.3 x 10–11 s3

(2.4.18)

(2.4.19)

where VO 2 = additional oxygen cost to overcome air resistance, m3/sec
Measurements of additional metabolic energy used by a runner to overcome air resistance vary
widely – from 2% (Bassett et al., 1985) to 16% (Ward-Smith, 1984).


CARRYING LOADS

CARRYING LOADS

Load carrying is an important aspect of manual labor and of certain sports such as weight
lifting. Load carrying has been the subject of a great deal of study by exercise physiologists
and ergonomicists, and it has even been quantified to a large extent (see Section 5.5). Yet
there are quite a few different ways of carrying loads, and quantitative description of these has
not been fully completed.
2.5.1

Load Position

Load position has an important effect on the amount of energy required to carry the load.
Body weight, for example, is carried with metabolic cost usually less than externally carried
loads, since it is reasonably well distributed and its center of mass passes through the center of
mass of the body. Light loads carried on the hands, on the head, and high on the back are
carried with almost no additional energy penalty except for the weight itself (Table 2.5.1).
Heavy loads on the feet and hands, however, pose a muscular burden out of proportion to
weight carried (Martin, 1985; Soule and Goldman, 1969)
2.5.2

Lifting and Carrying

Lifting of loads requires an initial isometric muscular contraction to overcome inertia and set
the postural muscles followed by a dynamic muscular contraction as the load is moved. The
major part of the lift, when it occurs on the job, is composed of dynamic contraction. Pytel
and Kamon (1981) studied workers to determine if a simple predictor test could be devised for
maximum lifting capacity of an individual. Such a test would be useful in industrial situations.
By measuring the dynamic lifting strength of the combined back and arm muscles and
comparing this to voluntary maximum acceptable loads lifted, they were able to obtain this
simple equation with an r2 (statistical coefficient of determination) of 0.941:
Fm = 295 + 0.66Fdls – 148Sx
where

(2.5.1)

Fm = maximum load to be lifted repetitively, N
Fdls = peak force developed during dynamic lifting strength test, N
Sx = sex indicator, 1 for men and 2 for women, dimensionless

Wyndam et al. (1963) give a regression equation relating oxygen consumption to work rate of VDO 2 = 6.535 x

10–6 + 2.557 x 10–7 WD where VDO 2 = oxygen consumption, m3/sec, and WD = work rate, N·m/sec (original
values of equation coefficients are 0.3921 L/min and 3.467 x 10–4 L/ft·lb). The range of applicability of this
equation is not known, however, since data were originally obtained from 88 Bantu tribesmen.

EXERCISE BIOMECHANICS

Average values for Fdls were 379 N for women and 601 N for men. Maximum dynamic loads
were 250 N for women and 544 N for men. Further observations on steelworkers exhibited
much more data scattering and much less satisfactory regression equations (Kamon et al.,
1982). Goldman (1978) reviewed the field of load lifting and Freivalds et al. (1984) produced
a biomechanical model of the load lifting task.
Givoni and Goldman (1971) proposed an empirical equation to predict metabolic energy
cost of walking at any given speed and grade while carrying a load. In developing this
equation they used data from many different sources but found excellent agreement between
data and calculations. They proceeded to provide corrections for load placement (as already
discussed), carrying very heavy loads (very heavy loads are carried less efficiently), effect of
terrain (higher metabolic costs are involved for rougher walking surface), and running (below
a critical speed which depends on external load and grade, running is less efficient than
walking). A more thorough presentation of this material can be found in Section 5.5.1, and the
reader is referred there.
2.5.3

Using Carts

Using handcarts to carry the load has been found to be much easier than carrying the same
load by backpacking. Haisman et al. (1972) tested four commercially available handcarts and
found that on a treadmill and on a level asphalt surface a 500 N (50 kg) load required a range
of 480-551 N·m/sec to pull while walking. The predicted cost of walking alone was about 446
N·m/sec. The difference between these two was the additional power required to transport the
load. Taken a different way, about 800 N-m/sec would have been required to transport the
same load on the back.
The same advantage does not appear to hold with rough terrain. Haisman and Goldman
(1974) loaded a cart with various weights carefully balanced in the cart. On a blacktop surface
little difference was found in metabolic rate of the subject whether he was carrying a 200 N
(20 kg) load on his back or 200, 600, or 1000 N loads in a handcart. On a dirt road or dry
grass terrain, however, metabolic cost increased up to 50% for the 1000 N load in the cart
compared to a 200 N load carried by pack. Although the metabolic cost advantage of carrying
loads in a cart is not nearly as great over rough terrain as it is over a smooth surface, carts still
make possible transporting loads that would not be possible to carry by hand.
2.6

SUSTAINED WORK

The capacity to perform physical work depends on age, gender, and muscle fiber composition
(Kamon, 1981). The demands which any given task make on the body can therefore best be
studied by standardizing, or normalizing, to maximal body capacity. For dynamic work efforts
it is usually maximum oxygen uptake which is considered to be a measure of maximum
capacity (see Section 1.3.4). For static work efforts the maximum muscle force or torque that
can be developed by the muscles is useful as a measure of maximum capacity. Thus work can
be sustained for periods of time depending on the type (static or dynamic) of work and the
fraction of maximum oxygen uptake (dynamic work) or maximum voluntary contraction
(static work).
Kamon (1981) gives the maximum time to exhaustion for dynamic work as
 VDO max 
 − 7020
texh = 7200 D2
 VO 
2


where texh = time to exhaustion for sustained dynamic work, sec
VDO 2 = oxygen uptake, m3/sec
VDO 2 max = maximum oxygen uptake, m3/sec

(2.6.1)


REFERENCES

67

Maximum oxygen uptake values maybe found in Table 1.3.2. Kamon recommends working
periods of texh/3 for sustained industrial work involving moving tasks.
Recovery time is generally exponentially related to work intensity. Kamon (1981)
suggests that a recovery time of twice the working time is sufficient to replenish ATP in the
muscles.
Steady-state (or sustained) dynamic submaximal work at rates above 50% of VDO 2 max is
accompanied by lactic acid production (see Section 1.3). Duration of resting periods for work
rates above 50% VDO 2 max should be based on the rate at which lactic acid appears in the blood
and the rate at which it disappears. Lactic acid appearance in the blood peaks about 240–300
sec (4–5 min) after muscular exercise ceases, and its elimination rate is linear at about 0.05
mg %/sec (Kamon, 1981). From these, Kamon makes the following recommendation for rest
times when working above 50% VDO 2 max :
