CHAPTER 5

Thermal Responses
Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, A and B, by a division in which
there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see individual molecules, opens and closes this hole,
so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from A to B.… He will thus, without expenditure of
work, raise the temperature of B ... in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.1
-James Clerk Maxwell

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Human responses to the thermal environment are many and varied. Active responses include
conscious changes of environment, such as removal of clothing, and unconscious changes,
such as sweating. Passive responses include heat lost or gained from the environment solely as
a result of temperature differences, much as heat is gained or lost by a house in summer or
winter. If heat is not removed as rapidly as it is produced, body temperature will rise, thus
aiding passive cooling. If heat is removed more rapidly than it is produced, body temperature
falls. High rates of muscular exertion generate large amounts of heat, which must be removed
or body temperature will increase to and beyond a point dangerous to life. Responses to this
challenge are the subject of this chapter.
5.1.1

Passive Heat Loss

Heat flow in a passive system can be predicted by a means analogous to Ohm's law (Figure
5.1.1):
q = ∆θ/Rth
(5.1.1)
where q = rate of heat flow, N·m/sec
∆θ = temperature difference between two places exchanging heat, oC
Rth = thermal resistance appearing between them, oC·sec/(N·m)
Heat flow in Equation 5.1.1 occurs because a temperature difference exists between the body
surface and the environment, and it is greatly reduced for surrounding temperatures
approaching skin temperature. When this happens, passive cooling is no longer possible, and
active mechanisms must be used to remove heat.
In general, thermal resistance is a complicated assemblage of more elementary
resistances in series and parallel with one another. The higher the total thermal resistance, the
lower the total heat exchange and the more insulated the system.
Heat exchange can occur by conduction, convection, radiation, or evaporation. For a nude
individual resting in a thermoneutral environment, 60% of total heat loss is by radiation, 25%
by evaporation, 12% by convection, and 3% by conduction (Nilsson, 1987). Conduction and

Maxwell introduced his demon in this way to illustrate the statistical nature of heat. Since then, the demon has been the subject
of much discussion.

variable is heat.

convection heat losses are normally calculated by means of equations of the form of Equation
5.1.1. Radiation heat losses, although properly proportional to the difference between the
fourth powers of the absolute temperatures of the two surfaces exchanging heat, are, for
convenience, frequently artificially made to conform to equations of the form of Equation
5.1.1. Evaporation, especially of sweat, must be calculated in a manner different from that
given by Equation 5.1.1, although sweat evaporation, if it occurs on the skin surface, directly
affects skin temperature and thus ∆θ.
Passive heat loss from a human occurs not only between the surface and the environment,
but also between portions of the body itself. Some thermal models (Brown, 1966) consider the
body as a series of shells exchanging heat between them. The simplest is a core-and-shell
model (Figure 5.1.2), where the core is taken to represent two-thirds of the body mass and
which maintains a nearly constant temperature. The shell, comprising the remaining third of
the body mass, is varied in temperature to control the heat loss from the core. Heat exchange
between core and shell can be calculated by means of Equation 5.1.1.
Heat loss is only one factor determining the thermal state of the human body. We are also
aware that the body generates heat, the amount of which is discussed later. Including this term
in a generalized heat balance gives
rate of heat gained - rate of heat lost + rate of heat generated
= rate of change of heat storage

(5.1.2)

Since stored heat is manifested as a certain temperature, we see that if the rate of heat lost
during exercise is not great enough, deep body temperature will rise, and it may rise to levels
dangerous to health.

shape to be cylindrical, with a cross section appearing as above.

5.1.2

Active Responses

The body is clearly able to actively respond to thermal challenges. Within the thermal comfort
zone (or thermoneutral zone), shown in a portion of the psychrometric chart in Figure 5.1.3
(ASHRAE, 1974), vasomotor responses are sufficient to maintain thermal equilibrium. In this
region, thermal resistance is actively varied by changing the amount of blood flow to the skin.
In hotter environments, sweating becomes an important active response. Evaporation of
sweat absorbs latent heat at the place where evaporation occurs. For nude humans, most of
this heat will come from the skin and thus from the interior of the body. For clothed humans
where the sweat has soaked through the clothing, evaporation occurs at the surface of the
clothes and is not as effective in removing heat as is evaporation from the skin.
In environments colder than thermoneutral, shivering becomes one of the foremost means
of producing extra heat. Shivering is the uncoordinated tensing and relaxing of skeletal
muscles. This muscular activity generates heat. For an unclothed individual, however,
shivering is not an efficient means of heat generation. One of the best insulators is a layer of
still air. Shivering under bare skin disrupts this still air layer (Kleiber, 1975) and may also
cause greater local surface blood flow. Wearing clothing makes shivering much more
effective as a means to generate additional heat because the sill air layer on the outside of the
clothing remains relatively undisturbed.
None of the unconscious active mechanisms is as effective as the conscious mechanisms
of adding or removing clothing, changing activity level, huddling together, moving to a region

bulb temperature and clothing thermal conductance is 10.8 N·m/(m2·oC·sec). The comfort zone is drawn

of less extreme environment, or modifying the local thermal environment.2 Indeed, it is the
human capacity to accomplish these active responses that has allowed people to exist in harsh
environments despite their semitropical nature.
5.2 THERMAL MECHANICS
In this section we deal with specific components of the general heat balance equation (5.1.2).
Although heat gained and lost by passive processes can occur by the same mechanisms of
conduction, convection, and radiation, we consider them, as appropriate, in the manner in
which they normally occur.
Figure 5.2.1 is a schematic representation of the heat loss mechanisms available to the
clothed human body. From the core of the body are several parallel pathways for heat loss: (1)
evaporation from the respiratory system to the environment, (2) convection from the
respiratory system to the environment, and (3) heat transfer through the tissues to the skin
surface. This last avenue is accomplished by a combination of conduction and convection,
which are difficult to separate. At the skin surface, heat may be removed by conduction
through the clothing or by evaporation of sweat. Conducted heat is lost to the environment by
convection or radiation, whereas sweat is removed by diffusion through the clothes and by
convection at the clothing surface. Each of these processes resists the flow of heat or vapor, as
symbolized by the resistances appearing in the diagram. Below each resistance is listed the
equation(s) by which it can be calculated.
Body heat is produced by chemical processes needed to maintain the body in proper
working order (basal metabolic rate), ingestion of food (specific dynamic action), and
muscular contraction. Heat loss occurs by the mechanisms listed in Table 5.2.1. As
environmental temperature increases, the role of sweating becomes much greater and that of
radiation and convection becomes much less.

Animals such as rats exposed to cold environments can be trained to work for pulses of infrared radiant heat as a physical
reward (Refinetti and Carlisle, 1987). This experimental paradigm has been used to study thermoregulatory mechanisms
associated with brain thermal stimulation, brain lesions, chemical microinjections, administration of pyrogens, and so on.

5.2.1

Convection

Heat loss by convection occurs by means of a simultaneous heating and mass movement of a
fluid, usually air. To avoid complicated geometrical and boundary layer factors, convection is
usually calculated by means of the simplified equation
qc = hcA(θo – θa)

(5.2.1)

where qc = rate of heat loss3 by convection, N·m/sec
A = surface area, m2
θo = surface temperature, oC
θa = ambient temperature, oC
hc = convection coefficient, N·m/( oC·sec·m2)
Relating Equation 5.2.1 to 5.1.1 gives
Rth = 1/hcA

(5.2.2)

Convection that occurs as a result of forced air movement—by means of a fan, or wind, or an
exercising subjects, for example—is called forced convection. Convection that occurs because
heating of the air surrounding the body expands the air, causing it to rise and establish thermal
currents, is called natural convection. During exercise, natural convection is too small in
relation to forced convection to be considered.
The convection coefficient hc is usually a function of air velocity, physical properties of
the air, and temperature difference between surface and air (Kreith, 1958).4 Posture of an

Heat loss in newton-meters per second is equivalent to watts or joules per second. In this text conventional units have appeared
elsewhere in parentheses next to standard units of measurement. Because of the numerical equivalence of newton-meters per
second and watts, thermal values originally in watts do not appear in parentheses.

and thus includes a means to correct as physical properties of air change with temperature, pressure, composition, and so on.
The experimental data obtained with humans, however, frequently do not include this generality.

individual also affects the convection coefficient (ASHRAE, 1985). In general, hc, can be
given by a relation of the form (Kleiber, 1975)

hc = k v

(5.2.3)

where k = coefficient, (N·sec1/2)/(oC·m3/2)
v = air velocity surrounding the individual, m/sec
Tables 5.2.2 and 5.2.4 give representative values of the convection coefficient for various
room air velocities. Table 5.2.3 gives equations relating the convection coefficient to velocity
for several different activities. Because activity is accompanied by relative movement between
portions of the body and the surrounding still air, the act of movement itself increases
convective heat loss. In Table 5.2.5 is shown the variation between the convection coefficient
hc and activity in still air, originally given in mets.5 The still air convection coefficient can be
calculated (ASHRAE, 1977) from

hc = 5.7(met – 0.85)0.39 = 0.93(MA – 89)0.39

(5.2.4)

where MA = metabolic rate, N·m/sec

A met has been defined as the resting metabolic rate of an average male. As such, its value has been standardized at
58 N/(m·sec), or 105 N·m/sec for a standard man with 1.8 m2 surface area. One met is approximately four-thirds of the basal
metabolic rate and will maintain comfort of a man with 1 clo of insulation in a room with 0.1 m/sec air velocity, temperature of
21oC, and relative humidity of 50%. (See footnote 8 and accompanying text for a definition of the clo).


367

Body Surface Area. Also needed to calculate convective heat loss is the surface area A. By
far the most frequently used means of calculation of body surface area of nude humans is from
the DuBois formula (Kleiber, 1975):6

Anude = 0.07673W0.425 Ht0.725

(5.2.5)

where W = body weight, N
Ht = height, m
A = area, m2
For an average man 1.73 m tall and 685 N (70 kg) weight, a nude surface area of 1.8 m2
results. Table 5.2.14 gives the distribution of this surface area over parts of the body.
All of this surface area does not contribute to heat loss with the same efficiency. Those
areas which are in immediate contact with other parts of the body surface clearly cannot lose
heat by convection or radiation. There are other portions of the body surface area that do not
feel the full effect of air movement across the body. These, too, are not as efficient in losing
heat by convection (and probably not by radiation, as well). Nevertheless, the surface area
calculated by means of Equation 5.2.5 gives a reference surface area over which an average
heat transfer coefficient may be considered to be effective.
Clothing the human body increases its surface area by a factor of 1.00 to about 1.25. In
calculating convection of clothed humans, Equation 5.2.5 must be modified slightly to include
this increase in surface area from clothing:

A = fc Anude

(5.2.6)

where fc = correction factor to account for extra clothing surface area, dimensionless
Values of fc are given by Equation 5.2.18 or 5.2.19.
Respiratory Convective Heat Loss. A small amount of convective heat loss occurs by
respiration. This heat loss is in addition to the heat lost by evaporation (called "latent" heat)
from the respiratory system, and this rate of heat loss (called "sensible" heat loss) is
determined as the rate of heat transfer required to raise the temperature of the inhaled air to
body temperature:

q c,res = mD a c p (θ res − θ a ) = VDρ c p (θ res −θ a )

(5.2.7)

where qc, res = respiratory convective heat loss N·m/sec
mD a = mass rate of flow of air, kg/sec
cp = specific heat of air, N·m/(kg·oC)
θa = ambient temperature, oC
θres = effective temperature of the respiratory system, oC
VD = volume flow rate inhaled, m3/sec
ρ = density of air, kg/m3
Some difficulty is encountered when applying this equation, however, because VD , ρ, and cp
are all functions of temperature.
Fanger (1967) proposed a simplified form of Equation 5.2.7 using, as an indirect measure
of respiratory ventilation rate, the metabolic rate:
qc,res = 0.0014 MA(θres – θa)

(5.2.8)

where MA = metabolic rate, N·m/sec
θres ≅ 32.6 + 0.066θa + 32ωa ≅ 34oC

(5.2.9)

6
Actually, the DuBois formula is 71.84W0.425 H0.725 where W is measured in kg, H is measured in cm, and A is in cm2. Jones et
al. (1985) give an equation they claim to be more accurate: A = 0.327 + 0.0071 W + 0.0292Lc, where A is in m2, W in kg, and Lc
is upper calf circumference in cm.

Thermal resistance of convective losses from the respiratory system is, using the preceding
formulation,

(5.2.10)

Varène (1986) proposed a different means to calculate respiratory convective heat loss.
He began with Equation 5.2.7, and replaced θres with a linear function of ambient temperature:
θres = a + bθa

(5.2.11)

where a, b = constants, oC and dimensionless, respectively
Thus
q c ,res = VDρ c p [a + (b −1)θ a ]

(5.2.12)

In the range 8oC< θa < 33oC and 10-4 m3/sec < VD < 5.83 x 10-4 m3/sec (6-35 L/min), best fit
values for a and b were determined by Varène and appear in Table 5.2.6. VD must be corrected
to BTPS conditions (see Section 4.2.2). These parameter values were obtained for normal
atmospheric pressure and composition. For nonstandard conditions, the STPD correction of
ventilation rate, density values, and specific heat values must be used correctly.
5.2.2

Conduction

Heat is transferred by conduction between parts of the human body and from the body surface
through clothing which is worn. Heat loss by conduction may be calculated7 from
7

Although this form of the conduction equation is often applied to heat transfer in humans, it is absolutely correctly applied only
to heat transfer across an area bounded by two flat parallel planes. If thickness is small relative to height and width, Equation
5.2.10 becomes a close approximation to actual beat transfer equation forms. If the conducting medium is too thick, the form of
the heat transfer equation must reflect the actual geometrical configuration. While the generalized conduction equation in

θi = temperature of inside surface, oC
θo = temperature of outside surface, oC
The thermal conductivity k is a property of the material through which heat is being
conducted. Thermal conductivity is usually somewhat dependent on temperature, but this
dependence is largely neglected (Kreith, 1958). Materials having high thermal conductivities
(especially metals) are considered to be conductors, whereas materials with low values of
thermal conductivity (especially nonmoving gases) are considered to be insulators. In terms of
Equation 5.1.1,
R th =

L
kA

(5.2.14)

Different tissues of the human body have different thermal conductivities, as seen in Table
5.2.7 (and Lipkin and Hardy, 1954). These values are necessary to calculate heat conduction
from the body core through the peripheral tissues to the body surface, as in a model of the
kind illustrated in Figure 5.1.2. When it is necessary to conserve body heat, cutaneous
vasoconstriction effectively reduces skin thermal conductivity compared to times when it is
necessary to lose body heat (Newman and Lele, 1985).
When calculating heat transfer through the tissues of the skin, muscles, and viscera, a
large contribution to heat gain or loss is due to movement of blood flowing through the tissue.
Blood heat gain or loss is distributed diffusely throughout the tissue and is considered to be a
convective process. However, blood heat transfer is not considered in the same way as the
convection just considered. Rather, blood heat transfer is normally considered to be an
addition or removal of heat stored in the blood (Hodson et al., 1986), and an additional
( mC c p ∆θ ) term is added to the generalized conduction equation (see Section 5.2.6).
Clothing. Clothing provides the largest amount of insulation encountered in normal life. The


370

insulation value of clothing is characterized by the accepted, but nonstandard, clo unit.8 A clo
is defined as the amount of insulation that would allow 6.45 (N·m)/sec (5.55 kcal/hr) of heat
from a 1 m2 area of skin of the wearer to transfer to the environment by radiation and
convection when a 1oC difference in temperature exists between skin and environment
(Goldman, 1967). The higher the clo value of clothing, the less heat will be transferred from
the skin. Clo, which contains the insulation of dry clothes plus the underlying still air layer, is
usually measured on a manikin with copper skin ("copper man") and heated internally to
simulate a human wearer with constant skin temperature (Goldman, 1967). This method
allows the normal draping and folding of clothes, which influence measured clo values, to be
present.
The combination (k/L) is usually called thermal conductance and will be symbolized here
for clothing by Ccl with units of N·m/(m2·sec·oC). Thermal conductance is used when material
thicknesses are standard (as with bricks or plywood) or, more importantly here, when the
thermal conductivity and thickness effects of clothing are not distinct.
Heat conduction through clothing is given by
qk =

6.45 A
(θ sk −θ o ) = C cl A(θ sk −θ o )
clo

(5.2.15)

where θsk = mean skin temperature, oC
θo = temperature at clothing surface, oC
Data for individual pieces of men's and women's clothing appear in Table 5.2.8 (see also
Table 5.2.16). In terms of Equation 5.1.1,
R th =

clo
1

6.45 A C cl A

(5.2.16)

Clothing ensembles require combination of conductance values for individual items in
Table 5.2.8. By regression this combination has been found to be (ASHRAE, 1985)
−1 C ) / A
R th = (0.82 ∑ cl

(5.2.17)

As mentioned earlier, the surface area A can be related to the body surface area as
calculated from Equation 5.2.5 by using a factor fc (Equation 5.2.6). This factor has been
found experimentally to be (ASHRAE, 1977)
fc = 1.00 + 1.27/Ccl

(5.2.18)

where fc = clothing surface area correction factor, dimensionless
for individual clothing items, or
−1C
f c =1.00 + 1.48∑ cl

(5.2.19)

for clothing ensembles.
Mean Skin Temperature. Mean skin temperature must be known to calculate heat loss to
the environment by conduction. The preferable means to obtain mean skin temperature is by
measurement. However, an estimate can be obtained from the following relationships
(ASHRAE, 1977). Each is essentially independent of metabolic rate up to four to five times
8

The clo unit was defined in 1941 as the insulation of a normal business suit worn comfortably by sedentary workers in an
indoor climate of 21oC (70oF).

θsk = 25.8 + 0.267θe

(5.2.21)

θe = (hcθa + hrθr)/(hc+ hr)

(5.2.22)

where hc = convection coefficient, N·m/(m2·sec·oC)
hr = radiation coefficient, N·m/(m2·sec·oC)
θa = ambient temperature, oC
θr = mean radiant temperature, oC
The mean environmental temperature θe is essentially a weighted average of mean convective
temperature θa and mean radiative temperature θr.
5.2.3

Radiation

Unlike conduction and convection, which require physical contact between the mass gaining
heat and the mass losing heat, radiation heat exchange requires only that there be an
unobstructed view from one object to another. Heat is transferred mostly by electromagnetic
radiation with a wavelength slightly longer than that of visible light. With a distinctly different
modality, radiation heat exchange has been found to depend on the fourth power of the
absolute temperature of the body accepting or losing heat:
qr (1 – 2) = σA1F1 – 2( T14 − T24 )

(5.2.23)

where qr (1 – 2) = heat exchanged by radiation, N·m/sec
σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant
= 5.67 x 10–8 N·m/(m2·sec·oK4)
A1 = area of radiating surface, m2
F1 – 2 = shape factor, dimensionless
T = absolute temperature, oK
The rate of heat transfer qr (1 – 2) is specified between body 1 and body 2. If there are but
two objects in the system, heat lost by object 1 equals heat gained by object 2:
qr (1 – 2) = qr (2 – 1)

(5.2.24)

With more than two objects, there is no assurance that the rate of heat transferred between
each pair of objects will sum to zero.
The shape factor F1–2 represents the fraction of total radiant energy leaving body 1 which
is intercepted by body 2. The quantity (A1F1–2) represents the fraction of the surface area of
body 1 which could be seen by an observer at various points on body 2 (Figure 5.2.2). Shape

factors are determined solely by geometry. A table of shape factors can be found in Kreith
(1958). A reciprocity theorem gives
AiFi – j = AjFj – i

(5.2.25)

and because all parts of a surface must be able to be observed by at least some portions of the
surrounding surfaces,
n

∑ Fi − j =1

i =1

(5.2.26)

Radiation can thus be described as a surface phenomenon that depends on surface
characteristics. Equation 5.2.23 describes radiation occurring between perfect radiators and
absorbers. To a human observer, a perfect absorber would appear to be totally black, since no
incident radiation would be reflected. These are known, therefore, as "black bodies."
Real surfaces are often not totally black. Incident radiation can be reflected and
transmitted as well as absorbed. To account for the fraction of radiant energy absorbed and
reflected, the absorptivity α and reflectivity ρ are introduced. For opaque surfaces
α=1–ρ

(5.2.27)

since transmissivity assumes a value of zero.
In the steady state, where the body is neither gaining nor losing energy, the body emits
energy at the same rate as it gains energy. To express the fraction of energy emitted by the
body compared to that of a black body, surface emissivity ε is used. Absorptivity and
emissivity are nearly identical numerically. If absorptivity and emissivity do not vary with
wavelength, the bodies are called "gray bodies,"10 and the amount of radiation energy
transferred between them and their surroundings is a constant fraction of black body radiation.
Average emissivities for various substances are given in Table 5.2.9.
10

For gray bodies, absorptivity α and emissivity ε are the same value if taken at any radiant wavelength. However, it is not
uncommon that a body emits the bulk of its radiation at a different temperature than it receives the radiation. Therefore, average
values of α and ε are not necessarily the same. Absorptivity α is thus properly evaluated at the temperature corresponding to the
emitted radiation striking the body, whereas ε is properly evaluated at the temperature of the body receiving the radiation.


374

For radiation heat transfer between real surfaces, therefore, Equation 5.2.23 is not
adequate. As a matter of fact, the possibility of reflection as well as absorption of incident
radiation considerably complicates the calculation of radiation heat exchange. For radiant heat
exchange between two bodies,

(5.2.28)

which accounts for actual surface characteristics. For radiation between more than two bodies,
a different scheme must be used for calculation (Kreith, 1958). Fortunately, the case where
radiation heat exchange occurs between two bodies, especially where one body, such as a
human, is totally enclosed within the other, such as his total environment, is common enough
and important enough to minimize the need to consider more complex cases.
For one body completely enclosed within another, when neither body can see any part of
itself,
Fij = 1

(5.2.29)

Furthermore, it is frequently true that the surface area of the enclosing body is much greater
than the surface area of the enclosed body (A1 >> A2).
Equation 5.2.28 becomes

(5.2.31)

Radiant Heat Transfer Coefficient. Because it depends on the fourth power of absolute
temperature, energy exchange by radiation predominates at large temperature differences
between the body losing heat and that gaining heat. Practically speaking, however, conduction
and convection cannot be neglected, and heat is transferred by several modes simultaneously.
It is thus convenient to define a radiant heat transfer coefficient hr to be used to calculate
radiation energy exchange by a simple temperature difference only:

qr = hrA(T0 – Te) = hrA(θ0 – θe)

(5.2.32)

Rth = (hr fc Anude)–1

(5.2.33)

and

The similarity of Equations 5.2.32 and 5.2.1 for convection can be immediately seen. Indeed,
if, as is often assumed, the mean environmental temperature θe equals the temperature of the


375

surrounding air θa, an overall heat transfer coefficient h can be used:
h = hr + hc

(5.2.34)

and the heat transferred by combined radiation and convection is
q = hA(θ0 – θa)

(5.2.35)

The radiant heat transfer coefficient can be related to radiant heat exchange by
hr =

A(T0 − Te )
[T0 − Te ]

[

= σε T03 − T02 Te + T0Te2 + Te3

]
]

(5.2.36)

for one body completely enclosed within another. Representative values of hr for Equation
5.2.32 range from 4.1 to 5.8 N·m/(m2·sec·oC) (Seagrave, 1971) with an average value for
normal environments of 4.7 N/(m·sec·oC) (ASHRAE, 1977). Kenney et al. (1987) used a
combined coefficient (h) value of 7.5 N·m/(m2·sec·oC) in their work. For a subject wearing
shorts and tennis shoes, the radiation coefficient has been estimated at 6.11 N·m/(m2·sec·oC)
(Goldman, 1978b). This value is to be reduced to 4.27 N·m/(m2·sec·oC) when the subject
wears long-sleeved shirts and trousers.
Similarly, the value of surface area to be used in Equation 5.2.32 can be calculated as a
fraction of the total body surface area (Equations 5.2.5 and 5.2.6) available to radiate. This
fraction is 0.3 for supine, 0.67 for crouching, 0.70 for sitting, and 0.73 for standing, regardless
of sex, weight, height, and body type (Figure 5.2.3).
A 15.4 cm globe with its surface painted flat black has a ratio hc/hr of 0.178, which
closely approximates the corresponding ratio for an average human body (Goldman, 1978b).
Globe temperature, as measured by a thermometer with its bulb at the center of this hollow
globe, can be used to estimate mean radiant temperature experienced by a human:

Tr = (1+ 0.222v0.5)(Tg – Tdb) + Tdb

(5.2.37)

where Tr = mean radiant temperature, oK
Tg = globe temperature, oK
Tdb = dry bulb temperature of the air, ok
v = air velocity, m/sec
Solar Heat Load. Human solar heat load can be a very large contributor to heat stress.
Roller and Goldman (1968) and Breckenridge and Goldman (1972) presented a means by
which this heat load can be analyzed. Referring to Figure 5.2.4, solar heat load in man can be
considered to be composed of several components. Sources of radiant energy are (1) direct
radiation from the sun, (2) diffuse radiation from dust and water vapor in the sky, and (3)
radiation reflected from the terrain. Energy from these three sources impinges on the clothing
surface and is reflected, absorbed, or transmitted to the skin [transmittance of light fatigues
has been given as 0.02 (Breckenridge and Goldman, 1971), but heavier clothing is assumed to
be completely opaque]. Radiant heat absorbed by the clothes is then transmitted by conduction
to the skin surface or lost directly from the clothing surface by convection or reradiation. Only
that fraction of the total incident radiation that reaches the skin must be considered to be a
heat burden to the body. Alternatively, one may consider the solar heat load to be a reduction
in possible heat removal from the skin to the clothing surface as a result of the increased

surface temperature of the clothes.
Direct radiant load qrdr is given as
qrdr = Anude fc r γd I

(5.2.38)

where γd = fraction of area of nude surface which intercepts direct solar beam (shadow area
on a plane normal to the beam), dimensionless
I = intensity of direct sunlight, N·m/(m2·sec)
fcr = ratio of γd for clothed man to γd for nude man, dimensionless
For diffuse radiation heat load calculation, Roller and Goldman (1968) proposed a
cylindrical model of a man standing in the sun. Direct incident radiation and diffuse radiation
impinge directly on the top and sides of the cylinder, but radiation reflected from the terrain
hits only the sides. Diffuse radiation on the top plane is simply the area of the top of the
cylinder times the diffuse radiation flux.
The top of the cylinder is diagramed in Figure 5.2.5 for incoming rays in one horizontal
plane. If uniform radiant flux is assumed, then for any angle φ between these rays and a given
vertical cross section, the ratio of radiation on the projection of the vertical plane M to the
radiation on the entire wall projection N is sin φ. Integration over the angular span of 0 to π
rad gives an average ratio of 2/π.
Rays that are not entirely horizontal will intersect the cylinder wall and the vertical cross
section at different heights. Some diffuse rays that would hit the cylinder wall would miss the
vertical cross section entirely. Breckenridge and Goldman (1972) assumed their cylinder to
have a large enough length-to-diameter ratio to be able to neglect any reduction in intercepted
diffuse radiation due to this cause. Thus the total amount of intercepted diffuse radiation on
the side of the cylinder is the area of the vertical plane times the diffuse radiation flux on each
side times π /2.
Total diffuse radiation is the sum of radiation on the top and sides of the cylinder:

378

where qrdf = diffuse radiant heat load, N·m/sec
d = cylinder diameter, m
D = intensity of diffuse radiation on a horizontal plane, N/(m·sec)
L = cylinder length, m
Relating the cylinder dimensions to the nude surface area of a man, which can be calculated
from weight and height (Equation 5.2.5), gives
d=

( 4 Anude f c γ z ) / π

(5.2.40)

and
L = Anudefcγh/(πd)

(5.2.41)

where γz = fraction of the nude area facing the zenith, dimensionless
γh = fraction of the nude area facing horizon, dimensionless
Therefore, Equation 5.2.39 can be rewritten as
qrd f = Anude fc(γz + γh/2)D

(5.2.42)

Terrain-reflected radiation is assumed to hit only the vertical sides of the cylindrical
model. Thus
qrtr = Anude fc γh X

(5.2.43)

where qrtr = terrain reflection heat load, N·m/sec
X = intensity of terrain-reflected radiation on a vertical plane, N·m/(m2·sec)
Again, referring to Figure 5.2.4, of the radiation striking the clothing surface, some is
transmitted and some is absorbed. Assuming all sunlight is absorbed at the clothing surface,
and not within the clothing, the resultant heat splits, some flowing through the clothing to the
skin surface, and some flowing to the air by convection. Thus
qs = (qrdr + qrd f + qrtr)(τ + αU)

where qs = solar heat load, N·m/sec

α = clothing absorptivity, dimensionless

absorptivity is 0.8 for army green clothes.
Values for γd, γz, and γh appear in Table 5.2.10, and values fcr appear in Table 5.2.11.
Using measured values of direct, diffuse, and reflected radiation, average predicted solar heat
loads were within 4 N·m/sec of actual heat load as measured by a heated copper manikin
(Breckenridge and Goldman, 1972).
For the purposes of prediction of solar heat load, it is not always possible to measure each
component of solar radiation. Roller and Goldman (1967) tabulated representative values
(Table 5.2.12) of solar radiation for nine different geographical areas from meteorological
data compiled for summer days at 1400 hours at environmental temperature levels expected to
be exceeded in only 5–10% of the days. They adjusted the data to account for conditions of
haze, humidity, and cloud cover. Caution should be exercised, however, in using these data,
because meteorological conditions are so variable.

5.2.4

Evaporation

One of the most important modes of heat loss from the body is by means of evaporation of
water. This evaporation is composed of three components:
1. Evaporation from the respiratory system.
2. Nonregulated evaporation from the skin.
3. Regulatory sweat evaporation.
Before considering the details of any of these, a general discussion of evaporation must be
undertaken.
There is a similarity between convective and evaporative processes because convection
involves heat transfer through a thermal boundary layer adjacent to the surface and
evaporation involves mass transfer through a concentration boundary layer some fraction of
the thickness of the thermal boundary layer (Threlkeld, 1962).11 Evaporative heat loss from a
surface is thus calculated from
qevap = hdA(ωsat – ωa)H

(5.2.50)

where qevap = evaporative heat loss, N·m/sec
hd = convection vapor transfer coefficient, kg/(m2·sec)
A = body surface area, m2
ωsat = humidity ratio of air saturated at body temperature, kg H2O/kg dry air
ωa = humidity ratio of surrounding air, kg H2O/kg dry air
H = latent heat of vaporization of water at body surface temperature, N·m/kg
The similarity between convection and evaporation is embodied by the Lewis number
(Threlkeld, 1962)12:
Le =

hc
hd c

(5.2.51)

where Le = Lewis number dimensionless
c = specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure, N·m/(kg·oC)
The Lewis number can be related to properties of the air, water vapor, and boundary layer
dimensions (Johnson and Kirk, 1981); it is illustrated graphically in Figure 5.2.6. The Lewis
number can be seen to be slightly dependent on wind velocity and average temperature of
body surface and surrounding air.
The specific heat of air c has been measured and can be calculated (Johnson and Kirk,
1981) from

 ω sat + ω a 

2



c = 1000 + 1880 

(5.2.52)

11
There are two modes of mass transfer from place to place. The first is molecular diffusion, analogous to heat transfer by
conduction. This mode requires a medium through which molecules move that is stationary at least in the direction of molecular
movement. The second mode is convection, which occurs when molecules are moved into a volume as bulk movement replaces
the mass in that volume. Molecular diffusion is considered later (Equation 5.2.70) and has been discussed as well in Section
4.2.2.
12
There appears to be some disagreement about the precise definition of the Lewis number. Threlkeld (1962) defines the Lewis
number as in Equation 5.2.51 and shows that this is equivalent to Le = [α/D]1 – c, where α = thermal diffusivity (m2/sec), D =
mass diffusivity (m2/sec), and c = dimensionless constant (value generally 0.3–0.4 for turbulent flow). Rohsenow and Choi
(1961) define the Lewis number as Le = (α/D). The first definition is the one used for further development in this book. Both
show the relationship between mass and thermal diffusivities.

where the specific heat of dry air is 1000 N·m/kg·oC and the specific heat of water vapor is
1880 N·m/kg·oC). Other parameters required in Equation 5.2.50 are the humidity ratio ωa,
which may be obtained most easily from a standard psychrometric chart once two ambient
measures are known, and the latent heat of vaporization H, given as (Johnson and Kirk, 1981)
H = 2.502 x 106 - 2.376 x 103 θ,

0oC < θ < 50oC

(5.2.53)

Frequently, evaporative heat loss is computed from a hybrid equation:
qevap = hvA(psat – pH2O)

(5.2.54)

where hv = heat transfer coefficient for evaporation, m/sec
psat = partial pressure of water vapor at body surface temperature, N/m2
pH2O = partial pressure of water vapor in surrounding air, N/m2
The heat transfer coefficient for evaporation is treated differently by different authors.
Seagrave (1971) gives a representative value of hva as
hva = 0.104v0.6

(5.2.55)

where hva = heat transfer coefficient for evaporation into air, m/sec
based on reports in the literature (see also Table 5.2.15). Goldman (1967) and ASHRAE
(1977) relate hva to the convection coefficient hc through the Lewis number. Equating
Equations 5.2.50 and 5.2.54:
hdA(ωsat – ωa)H = hvaA(psat – pH2O)

(5.2.56)


383

canceling the area, and making use of Equation 5.2.5.
hc H (ω sat −ω a )
= hva ( p sat − pH 2 O)
Le c

(5.2.57)

From Lee and Sears (1959), the humidity ratio ω can be related to water vapor partial pressure
if the vapor and dry air are assumed to be ideal gases following the ideal gas law:
pV = mRT

(5.2.58)

where p = pressure of gas, N/m2
V = volume of gas, m3
m = mass of gas, kg
R = gas constant, N·m/(kg·oK)
T = gas temperature, oK

and dry air,

convection is known. This similarity among Equation 5.2.61 for evaporation, Equation 5.2.1
for convection, and Equation 5.2.32 for radiation makes calculation of heat loss from these
mechanisms simpler than it otherwise would be.
The saturation pressure of water vapor is a function only of temperature. Table 5.2.13
gives this saturated pressure for temperature likely to be encountered at various parts of the
body. Some investigators (ASHRAE, 1977; Givoni and Goldman, 1972) have chosen the
saturated vapor pressure to be 5866 N/m2 (44 mm Hg) and others (Seagrave, 1971) have used
6266 N/m2 (47 mm Hg).
Respiratory Evaporation. With this general discussion behind us, we can now turn our
attention to the three modes of evaporative heat loss mentioned earlier. First, respired water
vapor heat loss13 can be calculated by means of Equation 5.2.54 with the proper value of hv. It
can also be obtained if respiratory ventilation rate and ambient water vapor conditions are
known, since air leaving the respiratory tract can be assumed to be nearly saturated with water
vapor at 37oC14:

q evap, res = VDρ H (ω res −ω a )

(5.2.62)

where qevap, res = respiratory, evaporative heat loss, N·m/sec
ωres = absolute humidity of saturated air at effective respiratory system
temperature, kg H2O/kg air
ωa = absolute humidity of ambient air, kg H2O/kg air
VD = ventilation rate, BTPS, m3/sec
H = latent heat of vaporization of water, N·m/kg
ρ = density of air, kg/m3
Hanna and Scherer (1986) formulated a model of heat and water vapor transport from the
human respiratory tract and found that the two most important parameters governing heat and
water transfer are the blood temperature distribution along the airway walls and the total
cross-sectional area and perimeter of the nasal cavity. Varène (1986) published a
semiempirical equation relating respiratory evaporative heat loss to environmental parameters:
qevap, res = 0.001 VD (59.34 + 0.53θa – 0.0116pH2O)

(5.2.63)

where θa = ambient temperature, oC
pH2O = ambient water vapor pressure, N/m2
Respired heat loss has been empirically found to be proportional to the volume rate of air
through the lungs, which in turn is proportional to the metabolic rate. Based on a mean
pulmonary ventilation of
mD = 1.67 x 10-6 MA

(5.2.64)

where mD = mass flow of air out of the respiratory system, kg/sec
MA = metabolic rate per unit area, N·m/(m2·sec)
13
Such heat loss can be a bronchoconstrictive stimulant, resulting in exercise-induced asthma (Sheppard and Eschenbacher,
1984).
14
Varène et al. (1986) claim that expired air is not water vapor–saturated and they have measured the temperature of expired gas
at 31.5oC for mouth breathing and 29.6oC for nose breathing. The reason for temperatures lower than body temperature is that
inhaled air cools the respiratory passages and exhaled air subsequently loses heat to them. This countercurrent heat exchange
mechanism recovers a great deal of heat that would ordinarily be lost in cold environments. Varène et al. also found about a 7%
reduction in convective and evaporative heat loss when breathing through the nose compared to mouth breathing.


385

and an empirically derived approximation that
ωsat – ωa ≅ 0.029 – 0.80 ωa

ωsat – ωa > 0

(5.2.65)

Fanger (1967) derived an equation for latent heat loss from the respiratory system. In terms of
the heat transfer coefficient for evaporation,
hvr = 1.725 x 10-5 MA

(5.2.66)

where MA = metabolic rate, N·m/(sec·m2)
and where psat is to be taken as 5866 N/m2 (47 mm Hg) and pa is 105 N/m2 in Equation 5.2.59.
Thermal resistance of evaporation from the respiratory system is
Rth = (hvr Anude)-1

(5.2.67)

where Anude is total body surface area.
Sweating. Evaporative heat loss from sweating skin is both regulatory and nonregulatory.
Unstressed skin always sweats about 6% of its maximum capacity. During long exposure to
low humidities, dehydration of outer skin layers causes this percentage to drop as low as 2%
(ASHRAE, 1977). Each kilogram of sweat requires 2.4 x 106 N·m (670 W·hr) to evaporate
(ASHRAE, 1977).15 The maximum sweating rate for an average man (1.8 m2 surface area) is
about 5 x 10-4 kg/sec. Maximum cooling is about 675 N·m/(m2·sec) (equivalent to 1200
N·m/sec, or 11.4 mets) for the average man (ASHRAE, 1977). This means that unstressed
skin is constantly losing about 40 N·m/(m2·sec) or 73 N·m/sec total. For relative humidities of
40–60%, ambient temperatures below 20oC, and during rest, evaporative heat loss amounts to
20–25% of the total metabolic rate of the subject (ASHRAE, 1977).
Regulatory sweating comprises the other 94% of maximum capacity, and this 94% is not
totally effective. Sweat that rolls off the skin is ineffective; sweat that is absorbed by clothing
may evaporate within the clothing or at its surface. Thus a more practical limit to maximum
cooling is 350 N·m/m2 (equivalent to 6 mets). The sweating process involves recruitment of
various areas of skin. Sweating does not begin over all areas at the same time or the same
temperature. Even in one area, sweating does not reach a maximum value all at once but
instead appears to be regulated to lose the required amount of heat. Table 5.2.14 lists preferred
temperatures of various regions of the body, along with sweating heat loss from these regions
under moderate heat stress. Overall, a skin temperature of 33oC can be assumed to be the most
comfortable.
Clothing. Figure 5.2.1 shows two series resistances between the evaporation at the skin and
ambient vapor pressure. Clothing presents an impedance to the movement of vapor from the
skin and will be considered first.
Nishi and Ibamoto (1969) developed equations for calculation of the heat loss due to
evaporation through clothing. They began with the form of heat transfer in Equation 5.2.54,

qevap = hvcl A(psat – pcl)

(5.2.68)

where hvcl = heat transfer coefficient for evaporation from clothing, m/sec:
pcl = partial pressure of water vapor at the clothing surface, N/m2
Evaporative heat loss can also be calculated from the rate of evaporation of water m v
15
The figure given by ASHRAE is equivalent to the amount of heat required to evaporate an equivalent amount of water.
Snellen et al. (1970) measured the heat equivalent of sweat to be 2.6 x 106 N·m/kg (43.3 W·min/g), or about 8% higher than that
of water. Their figure was independent of prevailing air temperature or humidity.

multiplied by the latent heat of evaporation of water H:
qevap = mD v H

(5.2.69)

The rate of evaporation of water also equals the rate at which water vapor is transmitted
through the clothing by molecular diffusion. Steady-state molecular diffusion is defined by
Fick's law (Anderson, 1958; Geankoplis, 1978):

mD v = DA

(5.2.70)

where D = mass diffusivity16 of water vapor
= 0.0883 m2/hr
A = surface area, m2
cv = concentration of water vapor, kg/m3

Substituting vapor pressure of water vapor determined from the ideal gas law, Equation 5.2.58
gives

Rv T dy

(5.2.71)

where Rv = gas constant for water vapor
= 461 N·m/(kg·oK)
T = absolute temperature, oK
p = water vapor partial pressure, N/m2
Integrating Equation 5.2.71 from the skin, where p = psat, to the clothing surface,
16
Nishi and Gagge (1970) give the mass diffusivity of water vapor into air as D = 0.0784 (T / 273)1.8, which means that D =
0.0883 m2/hr corresponds to a temperature of 19oC. Yang (1980) gives the mass diffusivity of liquid water through skin as 2.41
x 10-5 m2/hr.

mD v =

DA psat − p cl
Rv T
L

(5.2.72)

where pcl = vapor pressure at the clothing surface, N/m2
L = effective clothing thickness, m
The effective clothing thickness can be approximated by assuming the insulation value of
clothing results entirely from dead air trapped in pockets within the fibers:
L = ka /Ccl

(5.2.75)

The thickness of the diffusion layer for water vapor has been approximated by the term ka /Ccl
based on the assumptions that (1) the physical properties of clothing materials such as thermal
conductivity, moisture absorption capacity, porosity, weaving density, thickness, and chemical
treatment are ignored; and (2) atmospheric air movement does not break the still air layer in
the clothing.
Nishi and Ibamoto (1969) calculated an approximate value of the heat transfer coefficient
for evaporation through clothing to be
hvcl = 0.0179kcl/L = 0.0179Ccl(kcl/ka)

(5.2.76)

Rth = (hvclAnude)-1

(5.2.77)

With thermal resistance,

For perfect vaporproof clothing, hvcl = 0, and hvcl is independent of clothing conductance. This
restriction, however, applies only to a skin-tight suit completely covering the man (Nishi and
Ibamoto, 1969). Other values for hvcl appear in Table 5.2.15.
Nishi and lbamoto (1969) formed a dimensionless permeation index, P, which they use to
help calculate evaporative heat transfer through clothing and the surrounding still air layer:
P=

hvcl
1
=
hva + hvcl 1+ ( hva / hvcl )

(5.2.78)

They considered the permeation to be a measure of the cooling efficiency of the evaporative
heat loss from the body through the clothing. Actual conditions may cause changes in the
permeation as follows:
17

Johnson and Kirk (1981) give the thermal conductivity of air to be ka = 2.416 x 10-2 + 7.764 x 10-5 θa, 0oC < θa < 50oC.

Compiled from Kenney et al., 1987. Values were corrected for surface area by
assuming body surface area to be 1.8 m2 and clothing surface area correction fc to be
1.2. Average wind speed was taken to be 0.4 m/sec. Compare these values with that
given in Equation 5.2.55, which is for nude or very light clothing, and would be
expected to be greater than hvcl for protective clothing,

1. Wind penetration through clothing and ventilation through the neck and sleeves increases P.
2. There is a physiological property that most of the sweat of a clothed man is secreted on
exposed parts of the body, which increases P.
3. The interruption of diffusion by the fabric decreases P.
When hvcl is calculated by means of Equation 5.2.76 and hva is calculated from Equation
5.2.61, the resulting permeation agrees well with experimental data presented by Gosselin
(1947) and Nagata (1962). This agreement can be seen in Figure 5.2.7 and can be taken as
evidence of the validity of Equations 5.2.61 and 5.2.76. Although the permeation index P is
used elsewhere in the literature (ASHRAE, 1977), its use here is limited to a role of
confirmation of agreement between theory and experiment.

Selected values from Goldman.

In 1962 Woodcock introduced a dimensionless "impermeability index," im, to be a
measure of the resistance of clothing to water vapor. As described by Goldman (1967), the
evaporative heat transfer for a nude man or any clothing system could be expressed as the
ratio of the actual evaporative heat loss, as hindered by the clothing, to that of a wet bulb with
equivalent clothing insulation. This ratio of evaporative loss would vary from 0 for a system
with no evaporative vapor transfer to 1 for a system that had no more resistance to evaporative
heat transfer than the usual slung wet bulb thermometer. Radiation for men in comparatively
still air tends to limit im to 0.5 rather than 1.0 (Table 5.2.16). It is in terms of this index that a
model is developed here.
From the definition of the impermeability index, evaporative heat transferred (Goldman,
1967; Nishi and Gaffe, 1970) is
q evap =

im ( hva / hc ) ( p sat − pH 2 O) A
1 /(hr + hc ) + Lcl / k cl

(5.2.79)

Setting this heat loss equal to that treated by Equations 5.2.54 and 5.2.69–5.2.78:
qevap = wPhva (psat – pH2O)A

(5.2.80)

where w = fraction of the total surface which is wetted by sweat, dimensionless
The impermeability index is found to be
 1
L 
+ cl 
im = whc P 
 hr + hc k cl 

(5.2.81)

For completely impermeable clothing, im = 0, P = 0, and hvcl = 0. For an unclothed subject,
im =

whc
hr + hc

(5.2.82)

Data obtained from a sweating manikin, where w = 1, show almost identical agreement


390

between values of im measured directly and from Equation 5.2.81 when Goldman's fatigue
uniform and standard Kansas State University clothing are compared (Nishi and Gagge,
1970).
As a final consideration under evaporative heat loss through clothing, Nishi and Gagge
(1970) discussed the effect on heat loss of infiltration of sweat into the clothes. If the sweat
vaporizes somewhere within the layers of clothing, evaporation is less effective in removing
heat from the skin surface. Sweating efficiencies, defined as evaporated sweat to total sweat
production, are given in Table 5.2.15.
The water that fills the voids between clothing fibers increases the effective thermal
conductance of the clothes and, under some circumstances, tends to compensate for sweating
inefficiency. This compensation would be possible only if the surroundings were cooler than
the skin surface. Fortunately, this is usually the case during exercise. With high radiant loads,
however, sweat infiltration may add to the amount of heat to be removed from the skin
surface.
Vapor pressure at the surface of permeable clothing is not the same as ambient vapor
pressure. There is an effective resistance between the surface vapor pressure and ambient
vapor pressure due to limited movement of water molecules from the clothing surface. A
vapor convective process similar to convection of heat removes water vapor from the surface
to be added to the ambient air. The similarity between these two convection processes has
already been described and developed in Equation 5.2.6 1. Thus, once the convection
coefficient has been determined by one of the equations in Section 5.2.1, vapor convection
can be calculated from Equation 5.2.61, and the resistance to water vapor transmission at the
clothing surface can be given by
Rth = (hav fc Anude)-1

(5.2.83)

where a correction for surface area has been made.
5.2.5

Rate of Heat Production

In the general heat balance, Equation 5.1.2, the rate of heat generated must be added to the
difference between heat gained and lost to obtain the net heat load of an individual. There is,
therefore, a qualitative difference between the preceding sections and this, because we are
concerned here not with mechanisms of heat transfer but with mechanisms of heat generation.
Heat production in a human is controlled by hormonal secretion, which affects
metabolism. Metabolism is composed of the complex, step-wise processes that oxidize food,
called catabolism, and formation of energy-rich substances, such as proteins, fats, complex
carbohydrates, adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate, called anabolism. At the
cellular level, these processes contribute to the heat generated by the organism.
Basal Metabolic Rate. Heat is produced according to three classifications (Figure 5.2.8):
(1) basal metabolic rate, (2) specific dynamic action of food, and (3) skeletal muscular
contraction. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the summation of heats from all chemical and
mechanical processes which must occur to sustain life at a very low level. BMR is usually
determined at as complete mental and physical rest as possible, in a comfortable room
temperature, and 12–14 hours after the last meal (Ganong, 1963). It includes heat produced by
the nervous system, liver, kidneys, and heart muscle. Skeletal muscle tone and gastrointestinal
activity should be at a minimum. Actually, metabolic rate during sleep is frequently lower
than the BMR measured under standard conditions.
BMR is affected by age, sex, race, emotional state, climate, body temperature, and levels
of epinephrine and thyroxine circulating in the blood. Age and sex differences in BMR are
illustrated in Table 5.2.17. BMR decreases with age, with a reduction of 2% for each decade
increase in years (ASHRAE, 1977). BMR for females at all ages is about 0.9 that of males

when based on body surface area, as in Table 5.2.17. For average sized women with body
weights 0.8 those of average men, BMR, not based on area, is about 0.85 that of men.
It has been reported that Chinese and Indians have lower BMRs than Caucasians
(Ganong, 1963) and that Eskimos have higher BMRs (Kleiber, 1975). Stress and tension cause
increased muscular tensing, which increases the BMR even at rest. An increase in body
temperature will raise the BMR as well, due to the increased rate at which chemical activity
occurs. For each degree Celsius of fever, the BMR is increased about 9% (Ganong, 1963).18
18

The effect of environmental temperature on the rate of heat production is given by the Van't
Hoff equation (Kleiber, 1975):
(θ / 10)
Mθ = M 0 Q10

(5.2.84)

where Mθ = metabolic rate at temperature θo C, N·m/sec
M0 = metabolic rate at some reference temperature, N·m/sec
Q10 = Van't Hoff quotient, dimensionless
Typical values of Q10 orange from 2 to 4. That is, a 10o increase in temperature can cause a twofold to fourfold increase in the
metabolic rate. This same effect can be seen in many biological activities and chemical reaction rates.
The Van't Hoff equation is often confused with the Arrhenius equation:
Mθ = M 0− µ / T
where µ is a constant and T is absolute temperature.

BMR for an average man is about 84 N·m/sec or 0.8 met (Seagrave, 1971), which, as can
be seen from Table 5.2.21, is due to blood circulation, respiration, digestion, and central
nervous system activity.19 BMR has historically been considered to be proportional to body
surface area, since larger body surface areas lose more heat in cool climates and require higher
rates of heat production to maintain equilibrium body temperatures. Fasting homeotherms
produce about 50 N·m/(sec·m2), or 1000 kcal/(day·m2), based on body surface area (Kleiber,
1975). Table 5.2.18 illustrates this assertion for seven different species.
Another explanation for the variation of BMR with body weight is that BMR should
depend on body mass, since it is the body mass that actually produces the heat. This relation is
shown somewhat schematically in Figure 5.2.9 in a logarithmic graph (Seagrave, 1971). This
explanation is also favored by Kleiber (1975), who argues that, for all species but man, a
confusion exists over true surface area. The Dubois area formula (Equation 5.2.5) in man is so
widely accepted that the question of surface area in man is not considered serious. Kleiber
asserts that BMR should depend on body mass:
BMR = 3.39m0.75

(5.2.86)

where BMR = basal metabolic rate, N·m/sec
m = body mass20, kg
Body surface area, which has dimensions of length squared, is proportional to mass to the
two-thirds power.21 It is unlikely that a difference in the underlying relationship between
BMR and either surface area or body mass could be determined from data which include large
amounts of variation. There is not much numerical difference between mass to the two-thirds
power and mass to the three-fourths power.
Basal metabolic rate is strongly influenced by environmental temperature, especially cold
temperature. Heat-generating mechanisms such as shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis
are activated to maintain normal body temperature. When environmental temperature is higher
than thermoneutral, metabolic processes are thermally stimulated (Van't Hoff equation), thus
raising metabolic rate. Table 5.2.19 shows oxygen consumption indicative of metabolic rate,
as it varies with environmental temperature.
Exercise training has been shown to influence resting metabolic rate (Tremblay et al.,

Stolwijk and Hardy (1977) report BMR to be produced by the brain (17% of total), trunk core (60%), skin and musculature
(18%), and skeleton and connective tissue (5%).

1n standard gravity, this equation becomes BMR = 0.612W 0.75 where W = body weight in newtons.
21
As we saw in Chapter 2, area can be expressed in dimensions of L2. Mass equals density times volume, and density is nearly
constant between species. Thus mass is proportional to L3 Area, expressed in terms of mass, has dimensions M2/3.

2/3, indicating a relationship between BMR and body mass to the 2/3 power. (Data from Ganong, 1963,

1988). When exercise-trained subjects were allowed to rest for three days, BMR decreased
significantly. Thus comparison of experimental measurements of BMR between different
studies should be made cautiously.
Food Ingestion. Recently ingested foods also increase the metabolic rate, and this is known
as the specific dynamic action (SDA) of food. The SDA is apparently caused not by digestive


394

action but by catabolism as the food is chemically changed and assimilated into the body.22
Excess food nutrients, those which are lost to the feces, urine, and gas production, do not
result in an SDA (Kleiber, 1975). However, of the catabolized portion, 30% of protein energy
is transformed into SDA, 6% of carbohydrate is transformed into SDA, and 4% of fat is
transformed into SDA (Ganong, 1963). This means that a portion of food containing 100 N·m
(0.024 kcal) of protein, 100 N·m of carbohydrate, and 100 N·m of fat will result in an SDA of
40 N·m. This energy is higher in leaner individuals (Segal et al., 1985) and lower following
regular exercise (LeBlanc et al., 1984a; Tremblay et al., 1988). The energy value of the food
as it can be utilized by the body is reduced by the amount of the SDA. The SDA may be
released over a time period of 6 hours or more.
Muscular Activity. Muscular inefficiency provides the largest component of heat
generation. Efficiency is defined as

η=

external power produced
total (heat) power expended

(5.2.87a)

η=

external work produced
chemical energy consumed

(5.2.87b)

or

where efficiency defined in Equation 5.2.87a is the instantaneous efficiency, or the efficiency
over a period of time characterized by a reasonably constant rate of work.23 The efficiency
defined in Equation 5.2.87b is the efficiency for a particular task. The fact that physical work
(force times distance) or power (force times distance divided by time, or force times velocity)
appears in the numerator and heat energy or power appears in the denominator recognizes the
fact that an equivalence between heat energy and work is demonstrated by the first law of
thermodynamics. Food energy, which is the source of muscular energy, is usually measured as
heat in a calorimeter; it could just as well be measured as work in a Carnot engine.
The efficiency of muscular activity depends on the muscle used, the nature of the task,
and the rate at which the task is performed. In general, the larger muscle groups, such as the
gastrocnemius of the lower leg or the triceps extensor cubiti of the upper arm, have higher
efficiencies than the smaller muscles such as the opponeus pollicis of the thumb or the levator
palpebrae superioris of the eye. The larger muscles perform most external work and have
efficiencies of 20–25% (about the same as a gasoline engine); the smaller muscles perform
exacting control tasks and have efficiencies of 5% or less. More exacting tasks are usually
accomplished with a high degree of antagonistic muscular activity, thus reducing the overall
efficiency still further.24
Exercise physiologists sometimes define efficiency as (Kleiber, 1975)

η=

external work
total metabolic work − BMR

(5.2.88)

With this definition, walking 0.90–1.80 m/sec on a 5% grade, man's mechanical efficiency is
22
LeBlanc et al. (1984) showed that meals identical with regard to composition and caloric content produced four times less heat
when the food was placed directly into the stomach by means of a tube (gavage) compared with oral ingestion.
23
Constant rate of work is the same as constant power.
24
From the standpoint of thermoregulatory responses, skin temperature, core temperature, and sweating rate appear to be
independent of the skeletal muscle mass employed and appear to be dependent only on the absolute metabolic intensity (Sawka
et al., 1984b). Thus muscular efficiencies are sufficiently similar to evoke identical responses.

approximately 10%. On a 15–25% grade, it rises to about 20%. Best efficiencies of 20–22%
occur with leg exercises that involve lifting body weight. In carpentry and foundry work,
where both arms and legs are used, average mechanical efficiency is approximately 10%
(ASHRAE, 1977). Gross muscular efficiency varies with the work load, as shown by Figure
5.2.10 (Goldman, 1978a). As the resting metabolic demands of respiration, circulation, central
nervous system activity, and digestion become a smaller fraction of overall body oxygen
demands, gross efficiency approaches a limiting value of close to 20% for bicycling.
Muscles generally are able to exert the greatest force when the velocity of muscle
shortening is zero (isometric exercise).25 Muscular power must still be expended to maintain
this force. Since there can be no external power produced if the velocity is zero, muscular
efficiency for isometric exercise is zero.
Exerted muscular force decreases curvilinearly as velocity of shortening increases (Figure
5.2.11).26 Since power produced equals force times velocity, there is a maximum power
condition which occurs at about one-third of maximum speed and one-fourth of maximum
force (Milsum, 1966). The rate of energy use by the muscle also varies as rate of shortening
increases. Maximum efficiency therefore occurs at a lower speed than maximum power: at
about one-quarter of maximum speed and one-half of maximum force (Milsum, 1966).
Isotonic exercise, moving a muscle at constant force, will have an efficiency that depends on
the rate of shortening and the force applied.
The isometric length–tension relationship of a muscle (Figure 5.2.12) shows that the
maximum force developed by a muscle is exerted at its resting length and decreases to zero at
twice its resting length and also at its shortest possible length. Resting length is defined as the
slightly stretched condition the muscle is in when attached by its tendons to the skeleton
25
Energy consumed as a muscle contracts isometrically is proportional to the area under the curve of muscle force with time
(McMahon, 1984).
26
Hill’s analysis showed this curve to be a hyperbola of the form (F + a)(v + b) = constant, where F is the force, v is velocity of
shortening, and a and b are parameters. The parameter a is related to the heat liberated by the muscle (Mende and Cuervo,
1976).

(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Thus efficiency of muscular contraction depends on the length of
the muscle. Since length changes during constant contraction, efficiency is always changing.
Figure 5.2.13 shows one aspect of this change in efficiency for stair climbing at different
speeds (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
It is common practice to take the efficiency of muscular exercise as 20%. This means that
80% of the muscular energy expended becomes heat to be removed by the body. Tables
5.2.20–5.2.22 give energy expenditures for various activities performed by men and women.

tension (force/area) exerted by the unstimulated, or relaxed, muscle. The developed tension curve

Specific dynamic action of proteins appears to be unaffected by muscular activity
(Kleiber, 1975) and should be added to muscular heat production. Fat and carbohydrate SDA,
on the other hand, appears to be abolished by exercise and is not additive (Kleiber, 1975).
Exercise also has a lengthy effect on BMR. Immediately after the termination of
nonaerobic exercise, there is an increased metabolic activity to make up the oxygen debt (see
Section 1.3). This is immediate and relatively short-lived. Anaerobic work is less efficient
than aerobic work, with efficiencies as low as 8% (Morehouse and Miller, 1967). A longer
effect is also present. A 10% increase in a man's metabolic rate has been reported for as long
as 48 hours after strenuous exercise, and a 25% increase above basal level has been reported
15 hours after work (Kleiber, 1975).
It is the skeletal muscles that produce the extra heat during exercise. Some organs, like
the heart, become more active during physical activity. Some, like the brain, do not change.
Others, like the kidney and gastrointestinal tract, decrease their activity (Webb, 1973). None
of these produces significant heat when compared to skeletal muscle (Table 5.2.23).
Negative work is produced by a muscle when it maintains a force against an external
force tending to stretch the muscle. An example of negative work is the action of the leg
muscle during a descent on a flight of stairs. The potential energy of the body is decreasing,

since the body’s mass is being lowered. If left to itself, this mass would increase its kinetic
energy as it accelerated due to gravity. To keep the body's velocity from increasing beyond
safe levels, the descent is controlled by the leg muscles. These muscles are using
physiological energy and producing negative amounts of mechanical work. It is usually
difficult to calculate the actual mechanical efficiency of the muscles while producing negative
work (Kleiber, 1975), but negative work generally decreases the overall efficiency of a
maneuver (Alexander, 1980). For example, there is a time during walking when both feet are
on the ground (see Section 2.4). The trailing foot exerts a force while it shortens and thus is
producing positive work; the leading foot, however, exerts a force while it stretches and thus
produces negative work. This is the principle of antagonistic muscular activity: the action of
the leading foot is required for control of walking (actually, of falling), but the overall
mechanical efficiency of walking suffers (Figure 5.2.14).
As shown in Figure 2.4.5, running muscles expend more energy than walking muscles.
There is also a minimum energy expenditure for the walking–running composite curve for any
given grade of the running surface. As the grade becomes more and more negative (more
steeply downhill), this minimum energy expenditure decreases until, at a gradient of about
- 10%, no further decrease is seen. At slopes more negative than - 10%, the energy of walking
again increases (McMahon, 1984).
Muscular efficiencies for walking downhill approach - 120% (McMahon, 1984). This
means that the muscles absorb more energy when walking downhill than they expend during
walking. It also means that the heat produced by these muscles is about 220% of their energy
expenditure. From Figure 5.2.14, we see that energy expenditure of the muscle undergoing
negative work is about one-sixth that of a muscle doing positive work, for the same absolute
value of external work load. We might expect, then, a leg muscle going uphill to produce
about twice as much heat as a leg muscle going downhill.
Heat production during exercise is thus produced largely by the skeletal muscles. If no
better information on metabolic rate is available, then, as long as a significant change in body
fat does not occur, the metabolic heat production during a day can be taken as the caloric
intake of food during that day. If 145 N·m/sec (3000 kcal/day) of food is eaten, 145 N·m/sec is
the average rate of heat production.
5.2.6

Rate of Change of Stored Heat

The last term of the general heat balance Equation (5.1.2) to be defined is the rate of change of
heat storage. This term equals the sum of heat gained from the environment, heat lost to the
environment, and rate of heat generation. Any imbalance in these quantities will reflect itself
in a change of body temperature; during exercise this usually means an increase. This increase
of temperature is the manifestation of a rate of change of stored heat, since

qstored = mc

dθ
dt

(5.2.89)

where qstored = rate of change of heat storage, N·m/sec
m = body mass, kg
c = specific heat of the body, N·m/(kg·oC)
dθ/dt = time rate of change of mean body temperature, oC/sec
Physiologists have historically assumed the mass of an average man to be 70 kg (a weight
of 686 N). From Tables 5.2.24 and 5.2.25 it can be seen that 70 kg underestimates military
personnel body mass but overestimates that for college students. Women's average body mass
is about 85% that of comparable men.
The specific heat of the body is taken to be nearly the value for water, since the body is
nearly 98% water. This value, which appears in Table 5.2.7, is 3470 N·m/(kg·oC).
The increase in body temperature does not occur as soon as there is a net positive

imbalance in the left-hand side of Equation 5.1.2. Active control mechanisms to be discussed
in Section 5.3 attempt to correct the imbalance by causing the body to lose more heat. There
appears to be a lag time during which there is no discernible change in deep body temperature
(Givoni and Goldman, 1972). The magnitude of this time lag becomes shorter as the
metabolic rate becomes higher (see Section 5.5):

td =

2.1 x 10 5
M

(5.2.90)

where td = delay time, sec
M = metabolic rate, N·m/sec
After the delay time, body temperature still does not increase all at once but instead increases
in an exponential manner. The time course of rectal temperature change is discussed in
Section 5.5.
A different form of Equation 5.2.89 is used when a convective process is considered, as
in heat transfer by the movement of blood or other bodily fluids. In this case, mass moves and
(at least in the steady state) temperatures are considered to be static, unlike the condition


403

represented by Equation 5.2.89, where mass is static and temperatures increase or decrease.
The rate of change of heat storage for convective processes is
qstored = mC c (θ in −θ out )

(5.2.91)

where mC = mass rate of flow, kg/sec
c = specific heat of fluid, N·m/(kg·oC)
θin = temperature of fluid as it enters the surrounding tissue, oC
θout = temperature of fluid as it exits the surrounding tissue, oC
The tissue through which the fluid flows is usually assumed to be isothermal, and the
convective process is usually assumed to be effective enough that the exiting temperature of
the fluid equals the tissue temperature. Depending, then, on blood flow (see Table 5.4.5), a
great deal of heat can be delivered to, or removed from, a volume of tissue. While some
regions of the body, notably the liver and the brain, produce relatively vast quantities of heat
and are thus prone to possess temperatures higher than surrounding tissues and organs,
temperature differences are kept small due to the heat removal capacity of the blood flowing
through these tissues.
5.3 THERMOREGULATION

Animals that maintain their central body temperatures within relatively narrow limits are
termed homeothermic, as compared to poikilothermic animals, which control their body
temperatures very imprecisely (Ganong, 1963; Milsum, 1966). Humans are homeotherms and
must regulate body temperature within physiologically close limits: enzymatic activity
becomes very low below 37oC,27 and irreversible damage occurs to the central nervous system
above 41oC (Milsum, 1966). Very precise thermoregulation occurs only within the
thermoneutral zone (see Figure 5.1.3). Outside this zone, thermoregulatory mechanisms are no
longer able to maintain body temperature at a constant level, and a rise or fall of deep body
temperature occurs in response to the environment.
There are distinct and somewhat independent responses to heat and cold. In exercise it is
clear that heat loss mechanisms predominate, but heat maintenance mechanisms can interfere
with these and influence thermal response. For this reason, some explanation is given of both
responses.
Thermoregulation involves many bodily functions. There appear to be several levels of
thermoregulation, with the most precise control occurring with the hypothalamus intact, but
with subordinate thermoregulatory structures able to initiate localized and less precise control
should hypothalamic direction be lacking (Bahill, 1981; Johnson, 1967; Keller, 1963).
Thermoregulation employs feedback of thermal information to the controller, and this thermal
information is influenced by various bodily mechanisms intended to lose or maintain heat. We
discuss the thermoregulatory structures of sensors, controllers, and activating mechanisms.
5.3.1

Thermoreceptors

Thermoreceptors are small, unencapsulated nerve endings distributed unevenly throughout the
body (Hardy, 1961; Hensel, 1963).28 Thermoreceptors appear to be of two types, warm
27
Because chemical reaction rates are in general higher at higher temperatures, warm-blooded animals are capable of sustained
activity levels higher than cold-blooded animals. This has been of consequence in the survival of warm-blooded species because
they are capable of seizing prey and escaping capture even at environmental temperatures low enough to immobilize coldblooded animals (Johnson, 1969).
28
Several concentrations of skin thermoreceptors are in the palms of the hands and feet, the lips, and the pelvic area. Other
concentrations appear to be in the hypothalamus and in the esophagus. Thermoreceptors may also be present in the veins and
muscles.


404

receptors and cold receptors, with the difference being that warm receptors increase discharge
frequency29 with temperature increase in the thermoneutral range, whereas cold receptors
decrease discharge frequency with temperature increase in the thermoneutral range (Johnson,
1969). Figure 5.3.1 illustrates the difference between cold and warm receptor outputs. It also
shows the paradoxical discharge of cold fibers at high temperatures, which may be responsible
for the cold sensation felt when in very hot water (Dodt and Zotterman, 1952b). Somatic cold
receptors are much more numerous than warm receptors (Hensel, 1963; Zotterman, 1959) and
usually produce an output frequency in the normal range of physiological interest, whereas
warm receptors are fairly inactive (Hensel, 1963). Hence it is likely that cold receptors are of

in the middle a typical single warm fiber (filled circles), and to the right the paradoxical cold fiber
discharge (open circles) as a function of temperature. (Used with permission from Dodt and Zotterman,
1952a.)

Figure 5.3.2 Cold receptor response. When temperature is lowered, receptor output frequency increases.
There is an initial overshoot in frequency, which disappears after a short time. When temperature is
increased, steady-state frequency of the cold receptor again decreases. The transient response is negative
this time, even causing the receptor to remain silent for a period of time corresponding to the time the
frequency would have been negative. Larger temperature steps cause larger transient and steady-state
responses.
29
Neurons appear to carry information encoded as a series of electrical–ionic pulses normally passed from the receptor end to
the distal end of the cell. This series of pulses, referred to as the discharge frequency, can carry information related to the
frequency of pulse production or related to the temporal pattern of pulse production (Cohen, 1964).

current and exponential change in the Q10 term. Simulated is a temperature step decrease of 5oC starting

and Scott, 1971.)

primary importance in thermoregulation while warm receptors perhaps find their main
function in conscious temperature sensation (Hardy, 1961; Hensel, 1963; Randall, 1963).
Many different stimuli applied in sufficient magnitudes will cause receptor responses, but
the term "adequate stimulus" is applied to the type of stimulus to which the receptor is most
sensitive (Patton, 1965). The adequate stimulus for thermoreceptors is temperature level, but
strong mechanical stimuli can also cause thermoreceptor outputs (Johnson, 1969). Response
thresholds and sensitivities vary depending on location and normal thermal environments.
Receptors located in the tongue, for instance, have generally higher threshold temperatures
than receptors located in the skin (Hensel et al., 1960; Hensel and Zotterman, 1951).
Thermoreceptors appear, as well, to respond to the time rate of change of temperature
(Johnson, 1969) and therefore can be termed proportional plus derivative responding (Figure
5.3.2).30
Very few models of thermoreceptor action appear in the literature, but the model by
Johnson and Scott (1971) is based on the Hodgkin–Huxley equations for neural discharge.31
Reasonably good agreement was found between model response and thermoreceptor action
(Figure 5.3.3). As important as thermoreceptors are to temperature sensation and
thermoregulation, they do not usually appear as entities in thermoregulatory models (Hwang
and Konz, 1977).
5.3.2

Hypothalamus

At the base of the forebrain (Figure 5.3.4) is a small neural structure called the hypothalamus,
which has been found to be the center of thermoregulatory control (Johnson, 1967). The
anterior hypothalamus appears to be the site of heat loss control and the posterior
hypothalamus the site of control of heat maintenance. The anterior hypothalamus contains
30
Thermal sensations also appear to depend on the total skin area stimulated, known as "spatial summation" (Greenspan and
Kenshalo, 1985).
31
The Hodgkin–Huxley equations describe neural discharge by modeling cell membrane conductances for sodium and
potassium. They were first derived to describe the action of the giant squid axon but have since been used as a basis for
modeling myocardial activity, skeletal muscle action, and neural receptor mechanisms. For a good motivational background to
the Hodgkin–Huxley equations, see Stevens (1966).


406

Figure 5.3.4 Thermoregulatory centers and pathways. The posterior hypothalamic "heat maintenance
center" (P) is synaptic and indifferent to thermal stimulation. The anterior hypothalamic "heat loss
center" (A) is extremely sensitive to thermal stimulation. Center A operates by activating sweat glands
and vessels and by depressing the response of metabolizing tissue to cold stimulation of the skin. (Used

temperature-sensitive neurons (Hardy et al., 1962; Nakayama and Eisenman, 1961) but the
posterior hypothalamus does not (Benzinger et al., 1963). The anterior hypothalamus has been
postulated (Benzinger et al., 1963) as being the terminal sensory organ for warm responses,
and it transmits impulses to the sweat glands and vasodilation effectors. The posterior
hypothalamus performs not as a terminal sensory organ, but as a relay of impulses from cold
skin to the metabolic heat production centers. A connection between these two centers forms a
pathway for the warmth receptors in the anterior hypothalamus to inhibit responses to cold
from the posterior hypothalamus.
Because Benzinger and colleagues obtained their data from humans on whom
hypothalamic temperatures were inaccessible, they measured tympanic membrane
temperature (measured in the inner ear at the eardrum) and assumed this to be equivalent to
hypothalamic temperature (Benzinger and Taylor, 1963). They discovered that hypothalamic
temperature (tympanic temperature) was much more closely related to heat loss and
production than was rectal (or deep body) temperature. Drastic changes of metabolic rate
elicited by stimuli from the skin due to sudden changes of environmental temperature were
transitory, not continuous. Sudden cooling of the body caused the rate of heat production to
first rise and then decline to a new, higher level commensurate with the new, lower level of
skin temperature. When the skin was suddenly warmed in a water bath, oxygen consumption
exhibited a transient depression and then settled at a new, lower, steady rate commensurate
with the new, higher level of steady skin temperature. Benzinger et al. (1963) noted the
similarity between this type of response and the transient thermoreceptor response seen in
Figure 5.3.2 and concluded that skin thermoreceptor outputs, mediated by the posterior
hypothalamic heat maintenance center, were the cause of this behavior.
Steady-state responses of humans provide much more evidence for the hypothalamic
control centers influenced by cutaneous thermoreceptors. When the skin was cold, and the


407

central (hypothalamic) temperature was below a "set point," heat production increased in an
amount related to the difference between the set point and the central temperature level
(Figure 5.3.5). A family of curves was obtained, with skin temperature as the third variable.
Higher skin temperatures induced lower metabolic rates. No matter what the skin temperature,
if the central temperature was above the set point, sweating rates and vasodilation increased
rapidly with increased cranial temperature and independently of skin temperature insofar as
skin temperature exceeded 33oC. When skin temperature fell below 33oC and central
temperature remained above the set point, sweating was inhibited, even to the point of
disappearance (Figure 5.3.6). These results indicate that heat loss and heat production can be
determined if only the two temperatures, skin and cranial, are known.
This simplified model of the thermoregulatory controller is not universally accepted,
however. Most criticism centers about the assumption that hypothalamic temperature can be
replaced by tympanic membrane temperature (Randall, 1963). Others note local
thermoregulatory responses obtained without hypothalamic intervention (Blair and Keller,
1946; Randall, 1963) or of a smaller magnitude than would be expected from skin and
hypothalamic temperatures alone (Hardy, 1961). The first criticism can be settled by
experimental measurements, and the second by admitting that there are subordinate
thermoregulatory mechanisms involving only local feedback loops which are capable of local
thermoregulation of a less precise nature than hypothalamic control (Figure 5.3.7). Perhaps
more serious is the fact that hypothalamic temperature has been found to vary greatly within
short periods of time. Fusco (1963) found experimentally that when a dog resting in a

Figure 5.3.5 Experimental determination of human thermoregulatory mechanisms. Cranial internal
(presumably hypothalamic) temperature and skin temperature together determine body heat production or
loss. At cranial temperatures less than 37.1oC, heat production increases as cranial temperature or skin
temperature decreases. Cranial temperatures higher than 37.1oC elicit low, constant heat production rates
and evaporative heat loss increases. (Adapted and used with permission from Benzinger et al., 1963.)

409

thermoneutral environment raised its head, hypothalamic temperature immediately rose.32
Lowering its head caused hypothalamic temperature to fall. Changes in blood flow were cited
to be the cause (Hammel et al., 1963). Pettibone and Scott (1974) showed blood flow to be a
major determinant of hypothalamic temperature in poultry, but blood cooling in the neck and
heat generation were also found to be important (Morrison et al., 1982). Hypothalamic
temperature was also found to be highly variable by Johnson (1967) and to be related to
oviposition by Scott et al. (1970) and Hirata et al. (1986). Hammel et al. (1963) note that an
animal in a normal thermal environment would exhibit very different responses for the same
hypothalamic temperature when exposed to different temperatures or would exhibit the same
response at widely different hypothalamic temperatures at different times, depending on
whether it was asleep or awake. This brings us to a central issue on thermoregulation: just
what is the controlled variable? Is it hypothalamic temperature, deep body temperature, some
spatially integrated temperature distribution (Werner, 1986), amount of heat exchanged, or
some other, more complex quantity? Different responses to this question form the bases for
the thermoregulatory models discussed in Section 5.4.
5.3.3

Heat Loss Mechanisms

Heat loss mechanisms are classified in Section 5.1 as active or passive, and passive heat loss
was treated completely in Section 5.2. Hypothalamic control facilitates these mechanisms by
varying skin temperature and skin wetness, and also by reducing heat production.
Vasodilation. Skin temperature can be controlled by cutaneous vasodilation: arterioles are
known to increase their calibers by neural and chemical mechanisms (Ganong, 1963). When
the arterioles dilate, warm blood flows in relatively large amounts through vessels close to the
skin, thus raising skin temperature. As a consequence, convective and radiative heat loss is
facilitated. Vasodilation of the hand begins at an environmental temperature of 22oC, but a
general increase in skin heat conductance does not usually occur until an environmental
temperature of 28oC has been reached (Robinson, 1963) and may be delayed by nonthermal
factors such as motivation and emotion (Brack, 1986; Wenger, 1986).
Hypothalamic control of vasodilation appears to occur directly through efferent nervous
pathways and indirectly through circulating hormonal substances which it causes to be
released (Ganong, 1963). Local skin effects can sometimes be strong enough to overcome
central control.
Innervation of cerebral vessels is scanty and is not of functional importance (Ganong,
1963). This means that temperature of the head is very nearly always high and the head loses a
great deal of heat. Heat loss from the head has been estimated as 50% of total body heat loss
in the cold, which makes head coverings very effective for maintenance of body heat.
Similarly, head cooling has been suggested as a means to reestablish thermal comfort of
humans in hot environments (Brown and Williams, 1982; Nunneley et al., 1982), and many
attempts have been made to design cooling helmets. Indeed, any means by which heat can be
added to or removed from the head area has almost immediate effects on thermal responses.33
The magnitude of head cooling that can be accomplished in hyperthermia is limited, however,
to about 100 N·m/sec, which limits its use to providing comfort for resting individuals; head
cooling cannot be used to significantly reduce the heat burden of heavy exercise in the heat
(Nunneley, 1988). Morrison et al. (1982) applied heat to inspired air and found that
32
Although the central nervous system (CNS) weighs only about 2% of total body weight, it accounts for about 20% of total
oxygen consumption. The metabolism of the brain is therefore very high. Blood flow through the hypothalamus thus cools
rather than heats. When blood flow to the hypothalamus is occluded, hypothalamic temperature rises. Vascularity of the anterior
hypothalamus is markedly greater than that of the posterior hypothalamus, and it would be expected to be more sensitive to
cooling by the blood (Randall, 1963).
33
We have shown that a shivering bird can be caused to stop shivering almost immediately by shining a heat lamp on its head.
Shining the heat lamp on its body had no noticeable effect on its shivering.

large number of experiments on one subject. The data show how the thresholds for the onset of sweating

hyperthermic individuals showed rapid reduction of metabolic heat generation because central
heating was accomplished faster in this way than it would have been by heating the entire
body.
In Figure 5.3.8 is shown the rate of sweating as well as vasodilation as obtained by
Benzinger et al. (1963). Vasodilation is expressed in terms of skin conductance in
N·m/(sec·oC) or cal/(sec·oC) and is related to the previous discussion on conduction by being
equal to the inverse of thermal resistance defined in Equation 5.2.14.34 For the subject whose
data appears in Figure 5.3.8, there is an apparent increase of skin conductance of 251
N·m/(sec·oC) for each degree Celsius rise in cranial temperature beyond the apparent set point
of 36.9oC. This conductance change is due to an increase of 25 cm3 /sec blood flow35 through
the skin (for each 1oC rise in cranial temperature) and can drastically increase heat lost to a
thermoneutral environment. As an illustration of this point, the thermal resistance diagram of
Figure 5.3.9 is considered. Heat flows from the core to the skin surface by conduction and
convection, and from the skin surface to the environment by convection and radiation (which
may also be included within Benzinger's conductance values). Thermal resistance of surface
tissue for this subject is
Rth, sk = [18.8 + 251(θr – 36.9)]-1

(5.3.1)

where Rth, sk = thermal resistance of the skin, oC·sec/(N·m)
θr = deep body temperature, oC
34
There is an unfortunate conflict of definitions here that cannot be easily resolved. The definition of conductance as used in
Equation 5.2.16 is the standard definition used by heat transfer engineers. That is, conductance equals thermal conductivity
divided by thickness and has units of N·m/(m2·sec·oC). The way the term is used by some physiologists, however, includes skin
area as well. Units of N·m/(sec·oC) are associated with this definition. There is no alternative word to use for either of these
definitions.
35
Estimates of overall blood flow to the skin vary from 2.7cm3/sec per square meter of skin area (l60 mL/m2/min) in a nude man
resting in the somewhat cool temperature of 28oC to 43 cm3/(sec·m2) (2.6 L/m2/min) in men working in an extremely hot
environment (Robinson, 1963).


411

Figure 5.3.9 Decrease in skin thermal resistance and increase of heat flow from the subject whose data
appear in Figure 5.3.8, assuming deep body temperature (θr) equals cranial (hypothalamic) temperature
and that skin conductance is uniform over the body. General case (top), internal temperature below
threshold (middle), internal temperature above threshold (bottom).

Assuming a thermoneutral ambient temperature of 25oC (Figure 5.1.3), an average radiation
coefficient hr of 4.7 N/(m·sec·oC) (Section 5.2.3), an average convection coefficient hc of
6.0 N/(m·sec·oC) (Table 5.2.5), and a surface area of 1.8m2 (Equation 5.2.5), the thermal
resistance of radiation and convection acting in parallel is, by Equations 5.2.2 and 5.2.34,
Rth, r + c =

1
= 0.052oC·sec/(N·m)
(hr + hc ) A

(5.3.2)

Skin temperature can be found by realizing that all the heat that flows through the skin
through Rth, sk also flows to the environment through Rth, r+ c. Thus


R th, r + c

θsk = θa + (θr – θa) 
 R th, r + c + R th, sk 



(5.3.3)

and total heat flow is

q=

θ r −θ a
R th, sk + R th, r + c

(5.3.4)

Results are summarized in Figure 5.3.9.
For any given total body heat load, a significantly greater skin conductance was observed
by Robinson (1963) during work than at rest. This stimulating effect of neuromuscular work
has been likened to the reflex manner of respiratory stimulation during work (see Section
4.3.4). Benzinger et al. (1963), however, reported a decrease in skin conductance during work
which they attributed to effects of local skin cooling.
The initial reaction to heat stress is diversion of blood from the splanchnic bed, kidneys,
fat, and muscle to the skin to promote heat loss. There will also be an increase in cardiac


412

output (see Section 3.2.3). When the thermal challenge cannot be met, however, heat stroke
ensues. The onset of heat stroke may involve a decrease in central venous pressure and
consequent reduction of cardiac output. To compensate, constriction of both arterioles and
veins of the skin occurs. The resultant reduced body heat loss and subsequent rise in deep
body temperature causes death due to central nervous system damage or the fatal lodging of
emboli (blood clots) following intravascular blood coagulation (Hales, 1986). Reduced blood
volume due to dehydration while exercising may exacerbate the effect of central venous
pressure on cardiac output (Kirsch et al., 1986).
Sweating. Sweating appears to be controlled by local events more than does cutaneous
vasodilation (Figure 5.3.6). Very cool skin temperatures can extinguish sweating response
despite very high hypothalamic temperatures. Because of this, it is frequently seen that deep
body temperature increases rapidly after sudden cessation of exercise (see Section 5.5.2).
Apparently the skin cools rapidly because of evaporation of accumulated sweat, causing local
vasoconstriction and a sudden decrease of sweating.
Different areas of the body appear to have different preferred temperatures (Table 5.2.14)
and therefore begin sweating at different times. As more sweating is required, the surface area
engaged in sweating increases up to the maximum, and the rate of sweating in any area also
increases (Randall, 1963). The progression of area recruitment is generally from the
extremities toward the central regions of the body and headward (Tables 5.3.1 and 5.3.2), thus

giving evidence of some local control. Sweating is not a continuous but a cyclic process,
marked by alternating periods of high and low sweating activity (Randall, 1963). With full
sweating, the trunk and lower limbs provide 70–80% of the total moisture perspired (Berenson
and Robertson, 1973).
At maximum sweat cooling capacities of about 1200 N·m/sec (1030 kcal/hr), the
sweating mechanism fatigues in 3–4 h, or sooner if adequate water and electrolyte
replenishment is not practiced. Sweat rates lower than the maximum, or a high degree of heat
acclimatization, will tend to lengthen the time until sweating becomes fatigued.
Benzinger et al. (1963) present evidence that the central (hypothalamic) temperature set
point for sweating is the same for vasodilation (Table 5.3.3). Although there is no particular
reason why these two mechanisms must have the same set-point temperature, the set-point
differences presented by Benzinger et al. (1963) are very small considering the questions that
have been raised concerning the equivalence between cranial temperature and hypothalamic
temperature.
Grucza et al. (1985) investigated sexual differences in delay of onset and time constant of
sweating and their relation to thermoregulation in dry, hot environments. They found no
significant differences in time constant between men and women (about 8 min), but a longer
delay in onset of sweating was found in women (18.1 vs. 7.8 min). There appeared to be no
differences in body temperature responses to the hot environment, so they concluded that
whereas both sexes tolerate dry heat exposure equally well, sweating seems to be a more
important mechanism for heat loss in men than it is in women. Frye and Kamon (1983)
showed that in hot, humid environments, women had higher sweating efficiencies (lower
sweating rates compared to required heat removal) but men had higher sweating reserves
(higher possible sweating rates).
5.3.4

Heat Maintenance and Generation

In response to cold environments, several effector mechanisms are available to the
hypothalamic controller to maintain body warmth. These include vascular, muscular, and
hormonal responses.
Vascular Responses. Vasoconstriction occurs in response to cold environments in order to
reduce the difference between skin and ambient temperatures. Vasoconstriction is not
necessarily the absence of vasodilation; Robinson (1963) states that blood flow to hands and
feet is normally maximized by muscle fibers, which must receive constant nervous impulses


414

to produce vasoconstriction. Cutaneous blood flow to the forearms and legs requires increased
neural input in order to vasodilate.
What this vasoconstriction accomplishes is a shunting of returning blood from surface
veins to veins deep within tissue. Deep veins in limbs normally are located close to arteries
(Figure 5.3.10), allowing a large measure of countercurrent heat exchange to take place (Jiji et
al., 1984; Weinbaum and Jiji, 1985; Weinbaum et al., 1984). That is, returning venous blood
is always colder than entering arterial blood. The close proximity of arteries and venae
comitantes allows a strong flow of heat from artery to vein all along the parallel vessels
(Figure 5.3.11). Therefore, blood which eventually reaches the limb is precooled and
peripheral heat loss is reduced; returning venous blood is heated almost to body temperature

and does not significantly cool the main body mass. This mechanism has been highly
exploited by vascular structures called "retes," which efficiently transfer large amounts of heat
in arctic animals (Carlson, 1963). The effect of vasoconstriction is to increase effective
thermal resistance of the tissues, especially of the skin. Haymes et al. (1982) reported on a
study of exercise at –20oC in regulation cross-country ski uniforms.36 Addition of vests to the
ski uniforms resulted in a significant rise in skin temperature in the area of the vest and also a
significant decrease (about 33%) in tissue resistance. These results would indicate that
vasoconstriction, reacting to local warming of the skin, becomes relaxed and allows more heat
to pass from the interior of the body.
When local vasoconstriction occurs, subcutaneous fat becomes the chief insulative layer.
A linear relationship has been found between tissue insulation and percentage of body fat
(Haymes et al., 1982). However, the insulative shell for the body includes more than just
subcutaneous fat. Chilled muscles may also contribute to body insulation.
Shivering. Shivering has been already considered somewhat in Section 5.1, where it was
mentioned that shivering in a naked human can interrupt the insulating dead air layer
surrounding the skin and thus result in larger amounts of heat loss. Shivering, however, can
increase metabolic rate (as measured by total oxygen consumption) by approximately three
times (Hemingway and Stuart, 1963).
Shivering is absent in muscles below spinal cord transection, and a major neural pathway
from the brain is therefore necessary for shivering to occur. Integrity of the posterior
hypothalamus has experimentally been found necessary for shivering to occur (Hemingway
and Stuart, 1963).
Nonshivering Thermogenesis. There is a component of cold-induced heat production
which is hormonally controlled—nonshivering thermogenesis, (Janský, 1971). The two
hormones most closely associated with this general increase in BMR are catecholamines
(adrenaline, or epinephrine, and noradrenaline, or norepinephrine) produced by the
sympathetic nervous system and adrenal glands, and thyroxin, produced by the thyroid gland
(Hart, 1963). Among other effects of catecholamines, heat production is very important in
cold environments. Catecholamines can be released very shortly after cold challenge.
Thyroxin requires somewhat longer time, but it is more important in the long run (Figure
5.3.12). Both of these require the integrity of the hypothalamus (Hart, 1963).
Two thyroid derivatives have been found to be calorigenically potent. Triiodothyronine
has been found to be eight times as potent as thyroxin (Figure 5.3.12) in raising the BMR
(Ganong, 1963).
The SDA effect does not appear to reduce nonshivering thermogenesis but instead adds
to the body's heat production (Hart, 1963). Muscular exercise, like the SDA, also seems to
have no direct effect on nonshivering thermogenesis.
To sustain this increased metabolic rate requires a large intake of food. Appetite and
hunger, also under hypothalamic control, usually increase in coordinated fashion with
metabolic responses to cold (Ganong, 1963).
Age and sex are two factors influencing cold response in humans (Stevens et al., 1987).
Wagner and Horvath (1985) found that exposure to cold temperatures resulted in a body
temperature maintenance for young men; young women exhibited a maintenance of body
temperature at 20oC and a body temperature decline at lower environmental temperatures;
older women showed maintenance of body temperature at all environmental temperatures;
steady declines in body temperatures were seen for older men. Body fat percentages were
36

Among their interesting results was that an exercise intensity of at least 1050 N·m/sec (10 mets) had to be attained before the
body could maintain thermal equilibrium with the environment in a 4.1 m/sec wind. During the downhill portion of a crosscountry ski run, velocities exceed 4.1 m/sec with little muscular activity. Core temperatures have been observed to drop during
the downhill portion of the course.

found to be important indicators of these results, and the distribution of body fat was also very
important (fat beneath the skin acted as an insulating layer).
5.3.5

Acclimatization

Cold acclimatization is generally a coordinated increase in nonshivering thermogenesis and
food intake (Hart, 1963). Peripheral vascular readjustments (vasodilation) lead to higher
temperatures in limbs and appendages. In general, peripheral vasodilation results in higher
amounts of heat lost to the environment by acclimatized individuals. Figure 5.3.13 shows the
rapid increase in adrenal cortex activity—releasing norepinephrine—followed by a gradual
decline as the exposure to cold continues. Thyroid activity requires a longer time to mobilize
but is maintained indefinitely in the cold. Heat production shifts from shivering to
nonshivering thermogenesis.
Acclimatization to heat also is acquired as time of exposure to a stressful environment
increases; it begins with the first exposure and is well developed in four to seven days (Bass,
1963; Libert et al., 1988). Acclimatization is facilitated by activity in the heat, and it occurs
more rapidly to subjects in good physical condition (Bass, 1963). Acclimatization is
accompanied by an increase in blood volume (presumably to satisfy competing demands on
the blood for heat loss and oxygen transport) of up to 25%, an increased tendency toward
earlier vasodilation during exercise, salt conservation, and an increase in sweat production
capacity (Bass, 1963; Robinson, 1963). Heat-acclimatized individuals also appear to reduce
metabolic heat generation elicited by muscular exercise (Sawka et al., 1983). As
acclimatization progresses, increased sweating appears to assume the main heat loss function,
and vasodilation and blood volume return to normal (Robinson, 1963). Colin and Houdas
(1965) concluded that for nonadapted subjects the mechanism of sweating is activated by


417

centrally located receptors, but that in adapted subjects skin receptors are able to activate
sweating before central receptors feed their impulses to the heat loss center. Libert et al.
(1988) reported that sweat rates increased for successive exposures of subjects undergoing
heat stress, but that sweat rates began declining after three days. No changes in body
temperature were noted, but there was an apparent decrease in circulatory strain. Pandolf et al.
(1988) reported that age and sex differences in thermoregulatory responses to heat
disappeared when body weight, surface area, percentage of body fat, and maximal aerobic
capacity were no different between groups. Therefore, regular exercise was found to lessen
the effects of thermal stress; young and old men were found to acclimate to the heat in the
same way.
Contrary to belief, cold acclimatization does not affect heat acclimatization per se, and
heat acclimatization is unable to affect cold acclimatization. Both acclimatizations can coexist
in an individual; loss of one or the other results from the absence of an adequate stimulus
(Davis, 1963).
5.3.6

Circadian Rhythm

A repeating pattern of temperatures and thermoregulatory responses related to the timing of
external events is referred to as a circadian, or biologic, rhythm. The most completely studied
of these is the diurnal variation of body temperature. Resting minimum deep body temperature
normally occurs during the early morning hours, just before arousal begins (Sawka et al.,
1984a; Scott et al., 1970). Resting maximum deep body temperature usually occurs during
early evening hours (Sawka et al., 1984a). Deep body temperature differences are
accompanied by changes in hypothalamic temperature (Scott et al., 1970); therefore, there are
also diurnal variations in the thermoregulatory responses. Peripheral blood flow and sweating
rate change diurnally (Sawka et al., 1984a).
Sleep deprivation interferes with normal diurnal thermoregulatory patterns. As sleep
deprivation progresses, changes in deep body temperature become less pronounced. Panferova
(1964) reported that people with relaxed muscles who were placed in special chairs and water
baths for several days began to lose the characteristic body temperature cycle beginning with


418

the second day. Almost a complete loss in the cyclic pattern was seen in some subjects.37
Activity appears to be a prime stimulant for diurnal rhythms.
Strogatz (1987) reports that subjects who live in isolation chambers without time clues
often establish 24–25 hour activity cycles during which their wake–sleep cycles (controlled by
the central nervous system) and body temperature cycles (controlled by the neuroendocrine
system) are synchronized. Spontaneous desynchronization also occurs, during which time the
body temperature cycle remains as before, but the wake–sleep cycle lengthens to 30–50 hours.
Entrainment of the two cycles is eventually restored. Strogatz modeled these rhythms as two
coupled oscillators that sometimes become unlinked. The application of this model to the
disruption caused by jet lag or rotating-shift work schedules has yet to be made.
5.3.7

Exercise and Thermoregulation

The demands of exercise clearly strain thermoregulatory capacity, and thermoregulatory
responses interfere with exercise performance. Aside from the obvious increase in heat
production as a result of muscular inefficiency (see Section 5.2.5), there are other
interferences between exercise performance and thermoregulation. Most importantly,
cutaneous vasodilation shunts blood from the muscles to the skin to facilitate heat loss
(Roberts and Wenger, 1979). Not only do the muscles then lose a large part of their oxygen
supply, but pooling of the blood in the vascular bed makes that much less blood available to
support muscular activity. Acclimatization helps to restore the required balance between
muscular capacity and thermal normalcy.
There is evidence that exercise lowers the thermoregulatory set point for sweating (Tam
et al., 1978), because exercise sweating has been observed to begin at lower mean skin
temperatures than does sweating at rest. Exercise also appears to interfere with shivering
through some central mechanism (Hong and Nadel, 1979). Nonexercising muscles appear to
be inhibited from shivering when other muscle groups are used to perform exercise.
Shivering clearly interferes with muscular work, since the same muscles cannot be used
for both. Since shivering muscles are 100% efficient for heat production, but working muscles
are only 80–85% efficient for beat production, it can sometimes be difficult to control the
muscles to perform external physical work. Muscular heat production can actually decrease in
work performance compared to shivering.
Hormonal changes can have subtle effects on exercise performance. Increased levels of
catecholamines and thyroxin in the cold, or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal
cortical steroids in the heat (Bass, 1963), will likely have effects, sometimes facilitating and
sometimes debilitating, on exercise capacity. Injected atropine reduces sweating during
exercise, and this effect can be partially overcome by heat acclimatization.
Nicotine is a mild vasoconstrictive agent (Saumet et al., 1986), whereas carbon dioxide
and lactic acid produced during exercise are vasodilators (Ganong, 1963), which can lead to
increased heat loss. These substances usually improve blood flow through the muscles, but
their action may also interfere with proper thermoregulatory adjustments.
Sleep deprivation appears to interfere with thermoregulatory responses during exercise.
Sawka et al. (1984a) report that 33 hours of wakefulness followed by moderate intensity cycle
ergometer exercise in a temperate environment resulted in a decrease in evaporative
(sweating) and dry heat loss (vasodilation) compared to the well-rested condition. The result
was an increased rate of rise of deep body temperature in the sleep-deprived state.
Usually, thermoregulatory responses do not significantly interfere with physical work
capacity. This is more true of acclimated individuals, who also tend to be in better physical
condition.
37

Also affected were normal diurnal cycles in pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiration.

5.4 THERMOREGULATORY MODELS

Models to describe human response to environmental thermal challenges have been proposed
by many authors.38 Good reviews of these appear in articles by Hwang and Konz (1977) and
Werner (1986). Some of these have been implemented on analog computers (Brown, 1966;
Cornew et al., 1967; Crosbie et al., 1963; Wyndham and Atkins, 1968), others on the digital
computer (Gagge, 1973; Stolwijk, 1970). Most are constantly undergoing changes (Charny et
al., 1987; Charny and Levin, 1988), which makes constant monitoring of the literature very
important.
For the most part, these models incorporate various concepts of human thermoregulation,
as well as thermal mechanics, to predict a more or less thorough set of corporal parameters—
including central, or deep body, temperature, skin temperature, blood flow, sweat rate, and
sometimes much more. Most models do not incorporate long-term changes in
thermoregulatory responses (acclimatization), have not been adequately compared with
similar or identical sets of data, and cannot deal directly with thermal responses to exercise.
For these shortcomings, one must look to the deep body temperature model of Section 5.5,
which does not incorporate active thermoregulation and which does not pretend to predict an
exhaustive set of physiological parameters.
The models considered in this section are meant to illustrate several different techniques:
(1) modeling the human body as a circular cylinder with various distinct layers, (2) modeling
the human body as composed of many segments, and (3) modeling thermoregulation to
construct a surrogate thermoregulator external to the human body.
5.4.1

Cylindrical Models

Two models are described, both based on replacing the complex geometry of the human body
with a simple cylinder composed of distinct layers. It is obvious that the only part of the
human body that resembles a cylinder is the trunk, and perhaps the head. Legs (if they remain
together), and arms (if they remain close to the torso) can be reasonably included under
nonexercise conditions. The cylinder has the advantage of relatively simple heat transfer
equations, one-dimensional heat conduction (neglecting end effects), and no thermal
concentration points, as exist in a body of rectangular cross section. Other simple geometrical
shapes, such as prolate spheroids and oblate spheroids (Moon and Spencer, 1961), which
better match actual geometries, also possess the property that their differential equations
governing heat conduction are separable (i.e., temporal effects can be treated separately from
spatial effects).
Gagge Model. The Gagge (1973) model is a simplified version of that presented by Gagge
et al. (1971) and is intended to compare expected physiological heat stress caused by clothing,
radiant heat, and air movement. It includes elements of exercise adjustments.
The human body is considered to be a single cylinder with two concentric layers, similar
to that diagramed in Figure 5.1.2. The inner layer is the central core and the outer layer is the
skin. Thermoregulation is considered to be accomplished by a combination of skin and core
temperatures.
Central to the model is a heat balance, similar to that given as Equation 5.1.2. Rate of
heat generated M is actually measured. For most tasks, muscular efficiency is taken to be 0%,
for bicycle pedaling it is assumed to be 20%. The system of equations used by Gagge to
describe the heat balance is

qstored = qstored, core + qstored, sk

There also appear in the literature many thermal models dealing with animals. As examples of these, see Birkebak et al.

2. To account for evaporative heat loss, the contributing terms of respiratory evaporation,
sweating, and skin diffusion are summed. Respiratory evaporation was given previously as
Equation 5.4.11. Sweating is controlled by both mean body temperature and peripheral skin
temperature:
mD sw = 250A[β(θsk – 34) + (1 – β)(θr – 37) exp[(θsk – 34)/10.7]

(5.4.16)

where mD sw = mass of sweat, kg/sec
Passive skin diffusion of water vapor is assumed to be 6% of total sweat capacity:
mD v = ρd mD sw, max + mD sw

(5.4.17)

where ρd = fraction of maximum sweating capacity diffused (ρd = 0.06), dimensionless
mD v = total mass of skin water vapor, kg/sec
mD sw, max = maximum sweating rate, kg/sec

When clothing resistance to water vapor movement (Equation 5.2.77), the relationship
between thermal convection coefficient and vapor coefficient (Equation 5.2.60), and latent
heat are accounted for, we obtain
qevap = qevap, res + 250HAβ(1 – ρd)(θsk – 34) + (1 – β)(θr – 37) exp [(θsk – 34)/10.7]

psat = saturated water vapor pressure at skin temperature, N/m
and where the second term must be greater than or equal to zero and total calculated
evaporative heat loss cannot exceed the maximum value.

Gagge's model can be used to describe thermoregulatory responses to various
environmental and exercise conditions, but accuracy of transient predictions depends almost
entirely on time steps used for integration.
Wyndham–Atkins Model. Wyndham and Atkins (1968) proposed an analog computer
model which is summarized by Hwang and Konz (1977). This is a cylindrical model with four
layers (Figure 5.4.1): (1) a central core composed of skeleton and viscera, (2) muscles, (3)
deep skin and fatty tissue, and (4) outer skin. Muscular heat generated during exercise is
transferred to the deep skin by conduction and vascular convection. Heat flow through the
outer skin is assumed to be entirely by conduction, since this layer is assumed to be extremely


423

thin with negligible blood flow. All layers are assumed to be homogeneous with uniform
thermal conductivity, metabolic heat production rate, and heat exchange with the blood.
Heat exchange is by conduction, assumed to occur only radially, and by vascular
convection, from capillaries only. That is, all arterial blood has the same temperature, no
matter which layer it enters. Capillary blood enters at the arterial blood temperature and leaves
through the veins at the local tissue temperature.
A control center has temperature receptors near the skin surface, within the spinal cord,
and within the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic temperature is nearly equal to arterial blood
temperature, and arterial blood temperature is assumed to be the internal reference
temperature that controls blood flow, heat production rate, and sweat rate.
The system of equations for heat transfer begins with the generalized heat balance
equation (5.1.2) for radial conduction. Rate of change of heat is set equal to radially conducted
heat plus heat supplied by the blood:

425

Thermoregulatory equations are based on experimental findings from four highly
acclimatized subjects under steady-state conditions (Wyndham and Atkins, 1968) and are
therefore limited in range of applicability. To form prediction equations from their data,
Wyndham and Atkins assumed a hypothalamic model as in Figure 5.4.2, where facilitation of
the effector neurons in the heat loss center by incoming impulses from hypothalamic
thermoreceptors and cutaneous thermoreceptors results in sweating and increased thermal
conductance. Facilitation of effector neurons in the heat maintenance center results in
cutaneous vasoconstriction and shivering. Facilitation of one center inhibits the other.
The equations for sweating are developed only for skin temperatures less than or equal to
33oC, which Wyndham and Atkins termed the "cold zone":
qevap = [H/3600][0.55(θr – 36.5) – 0.455(θr – 36.35)(1 – e-2.7[33 – θsk])]

θsk > 33oC
(5.4.26)

This equation fits their data only approximately; other equations for evaporative heat loss, as
well as other thermoregulatory processes, were not presented. Notice that Wyndham and
Atkins assumed temperature set points of 36.5 and 33oC in deep body and skin temperatures.
Gagge used temperatures of 37 and 34oC for the same variables.
5.4.2

Multicompartment Model

The Stolwijk (1970) model, which is really an extension of models by Crosbie et al. (1963),
their colleagues J. D. Hardy and H. T. Hammel, and others at the John B. Pierce Foundation in
New Haven, Connecticut, uses a multicompartment model similar to that presented by Wissler
(1963). The body is divided into six segments (head, trunk, arms, legs, hands, and feet) linked
together via blood flow to and from a central blood compartment (Figure 5.4.3). Each segment
is composed of four layers of core, muscle, fat, and skin. There are thus 24 compartments plus
the central blood compartment for a total of 25, each requiring heat balance equations similar

identification: 1 = head; 2 = trunk; 3 = arms; 4 = hands; 5 = legs; 6 = feet. Each segment is composed of

to Equation 5.1.2. The head segment is considered to be a sphere, whereas trunk, arms, hands,
legs, and feet are considered to be cylinders. Basic body data and segmental areas, volumes,
and masses used by Stolwijk and Hardy (1977) appear in Tables 5.4.2–5.4.4. Table 5.4.5 lists
assumed dimensions for each of the body compartments. Volumes appearing in the table are
inclusive; that is, inner compartment volumes have not been subtracted from outer
compartment volumes. Thus the total volume of 0.0744 m3 (74.4 L) is obtained by adding
each of the skin compartment volumes and neglecting the blood compartment volume (which,
in reality, appears within the other compartmental volumes).
The heat generation term is composed of basal metabolism (Table 5.4.5) plus activity
metabolism. For the three interior layers of core, muscle, and fat, heat input and output occur
through tissue conduction and blood flow convection (Figure 5.4.4). Thermal conductances
between segments are calculated and appear in Table 5.4.5.
The outer layer of skin exchanges heat with the environment through evaporation,
convection, and radiation. Heat transfer coefficient values which appear in Table 5.4.3 are for
the natural convection condition and must be modified by Equation 5.4.27 to account for
external relative air movement:
h = hr + 3.16hcv0.5

(5.4.27)

where h = combined convection and radiation coefficient, N·m/(m2·sec·oC) (Table 5.4.3)
hr = radiation coefficient, N·m/(m2·sec·oC) (Table 5.4.3)
hc = convection coefficient, N·m/(m2·sec·oC) (Table 5.4.3)
v = relative wind speed, m/sec
Because there are 25 compartments, there are many redundant equations in the Stolwijk
and Hardy model. The following heat exchange equations are to be applied to each
compartment:
1. For heat exchange between each compartment and the blood:
qc, bl = 3600 Vbl (θi– θbl)

(5.4.28)

2. For conduction between segments:
qk = C(θi– θj)

(5.4.29)

3. For net heat transfer from each compartment:
q = Mi – qevap – qc, bl – qk

measures are required. The total control signal is considered to be composed of the error
signal in the compartment corresponding to the brain (head core) and error signals from the
skin areas of each segment. Weighting is applied to these skin signals in an attempt to account
for different thermoreceptor concentrations in different skin areas. Applicable weighting
factors for thermosensory inputs appear in Table 5.4.7.
Output signals are required for sweating, vasodilation, shivering, and vasoconstriction.
These are then used to vary blood flow, metabolic rate, and skin evaporation heat loss. These
four signals are calculated by

Mmus = BMRmus + Wmus Fmus + (SH)Fsh

(5.4.38)

Mall others = BMR

(5.4.39)

where BMR = basal metabolic rate, N·m/sec
M = metabolic rate in each compartment, N·m/sec
Wmus = total muscular work rate, N·m/sec
Fmus = fraction of work done by each muscle compartment, dimensionless (Table
5.4.8)
Fsh = fraction of total shivering done by each muscle compartment, dimensionless
(Table 5.4.8)
Evaporative heat loss from the respiratory system is

qevap, res = (86.4 + M)(1.725 x 10-4)(5866 – pH2O)

(5.4.40)

and evaporation from the skin is

qevap, sk = (qevap, b + [Fsw][SW]) 2(θ sk −θ spsk ) / 4

(5.4.41)

For all other compartments,

qevap = 0
where qevap, res = evaporative heat loss from the respiratory system, N·m/sec
qevap, sk = evaporative heat loss from the skin, N·m/sec
qevap, b = basal evaporative heat loss from the skin, N·m/sec (Table 5.4.9)
Fsw = fraction of sweating command applicable to each skin compartment, dimensionless (Table 5.4.7)
M = metabolic equivalent of muscular work, N·m/sec
pH2O = ambient vapor pressure, N/m2
The fraction Fsw accounts for the fact that there is an uneven distribution of sweat gland
concentration and skin area in different skin segments. Thus sweating heat loss from each skin
segment is different from the others. The term 2(θ sk −θ spsk ) / 4 accounts for a local skin
temperature effect on the skin sweating heat loss. Stolwijk and Hardy (1977) indicate that the
denominator of the exponent should be 10, but their program shows it as 4.

Total evaporative heat loss cannot exceed the maximum obtained when the skin is totally
wet. Maximum evaporative heat loss is checked using the Lewis relationship presented in
Equation 5.2.61:

qevap, max = 0.0165hcA(psat – pH2O) > qevap, sk

(5.4.42)

where qevap, max = maximum evaporative heat loss from the skin, N·m/sec
hc = convection coefficient, N·m/(m2·sec·oC) (Table 5.4.3)
A = area of each skin segment, m2 (Table 5.4.3)
psat = partial pressure of water vapor at the temperature of the evaporation
surface, N/m2 (Table 5.2.12)
Blood flow to each compartment is also computed. The core and fat compartments are
assumed to maintain blood flow at their basal levels (Table 5.4.5). Muscle blood flow is
calculated from
Vbl = Vbl, b + 3.60(M – BMR)

Fvd = fraction of vasodilation command applicable to each skin area, dimensionless
(Table 5.4.7)
Fvc = fraction of vasoconstriction command applicable to each skin area, dimensionless (Table 5.4.7)
The term 2 (θsk −θspsk ) /10 accounts for local temperature effects on skin blood flow.
Model and experimental results are compared in Figure 5.4.5 (Stolwijk and Hardy, 1977).
The model gives a reasonably close fit. Another comparison by Hancock (1981) indicates that
the model does not always closely predict mean body temperature during exercise. The value
of this model, however, goes beyond the comparison with experimental values, because the
amount of research that was necessary to estimate parameter values was tremendous. These
values, which appear in Tables 5.4.2–5.4.9, can be useful in other anthropometric studies not
necessarily related to thermoregulation or exercise.
5.4.3

External Thermoregulation

An external thermoregulatory system has many advantages for the design of space suits or
other impermeable clothing where accumulation of sweat poses an extreme design difficulty.


434

Figure 5.4.5 Comparison of physiological data with theoretical values derived from the model. A subject
clad in shorts sat for 1800 sec (30 min) in a neutral environment, 30oC, and transferred quickly to a room
at 48oC for 7200 sec (2 hr). A final hour was spent at 30oC. Solid lines denote experimental data; dashed
lines denote computed values. (Adapted and used with permission from Stolwijk and Hardy, 1977.)

Since working subjects are often poor judges of their own thermal states, they cannot be relied
upon to adequately control external cooling. Automatic control is thus offered as a reasonable
design alternative. This control must be both accurate and timely despite changing activity
levels.
Webb et al. (1968, 1970) successfully operated external cooling devices with closed-loop
controllers utilizing physiological input feedback. Figure 5.4.6 is the basic diagram of these
systems.
Cooling water is circulated by a pump from inside the suit, where it absorbs heat, to an
external thermoelectric cooler, where it is cooled. Webb et al. (1968) chose a constant water
flow of 2.5 x 10-5 m3/sec (1.5 L/min), which would keep a resting subject comfortable at a
temperature of 26–32oC yet could remove all metabolic heat a man brought to his surface
during hard work.
Two water temperature controller principles were successfully used. The first uses human
oxygen consumption as a measure of metabolic heat production. The difficulty with this
method is that oxygen consumption can change rapidly, but water inlet temperature requires a
longer time to change. There is human body thermal mass, which slows the rate of change of

body temperature upon initiation of activity (see Section 5.5.2). Human and mechanical
cooling systems must be matched. Webb et al. (1968) give an equation from which the
controller may operate:
τc θDwi = – θwi + B(M0 – M)

(5.4.45)

where τc = controller time constant, sec
θDwi = rate of change of inlet water temperature, oC/sec
θwi = inlet water temperature, oC
B = gain of the system, oC·sec/(N·m)
M = metabolic rate measured from oxygen consumption, N·m/sec
M0 = reference metabolic rate, N·m/sec
A second controller principle operates by matching heat removed by the cooling water to
maintain thermal equilibrium from the skin. This is a much more direct feedback control
principle than the controller using oxygen consumption (which is nearly open loop).
Temperature of the inlet and outlet manifolds of the water-cooled suit are used to obtain
total amount of heat removed. Average skin temperature is derived from four thermistors
placed inside the suit over the thigh muscle, the biceps, the lower abdomen, and the kidney.
When this average temperature increases, inlet water temperature decreases to increase heat
removal:
m c (θw0 – θwi) – q0 =

θ sk −θ sk 0
B

where m = mass rate of water flow, kg/sec
c = specific heat of cooling water, N·m/(kg oC)
θw0 = outlet water temperature, oC
q0 = resting cooling rate, N·m/sec
θsk = skin temperature, oC
θsk0 = resting skin temperature, oC
B = system gain, oC·sec/(N·m)

Although the hypothalamic area is the site of precise thermoregulation, human hypothalamic
temperature itself is an inaccessible index of thermal stress. Furthermore, the environmental
range where thermoregulation finely adjusts bodily responses is fairly narrow. At high levels
of exercise, or in very hot environments, the body reacts grossly, not entirely able to maintain
a constant body temperature but instead attempting to constrain body temperature rises to
those not damaging to itself.
Rectal temperature, as measured 8 cm beyond the sphincter, is an easily obtained index of
heat loss, and when rectal temperature approaches 40oC in normal men, heat exhaustion is
imminent. Thermoregulatory mechanisms have been known to lose control, with resulting
rapid increases in body temperature and probable death.
The major impetus for development of models to predict deep body temperature during
exercise has come from two sources: the military and industry. In the military, heat stress can
be a significant influence on the capabilities of fighting men (Belyavin et al., 1979), and by
knowing probable responses to work, environment, and clothing, suitable adjustments can be
made.
Heat stress is also important in industries such as foundries and steel mills, and recent
attention has been focussed on better protection of workers (Kamon, 1984). Of these two
motivators, work has progressed furthest on the military models (Pandolf et al., 1986).
Therefore, most of the following discussion applies mainly to average responses of young,
healthy, reasonably fit, heat-acclimatized men. Even among this group, individual differences
may be significant and cannot be totally corrected.
5.5.1

Equilibrium Temperature

As long as exercise occurs at or below the comfort zone (the zone of thermoregulation in
Figure 5.1.3), rectal temperature depends only on the metabolic level and is independent of
climatic conditions (Lind, 1963; Nielsen and Nielsen, 1962). When immediate
thermoregulatory mechanisms have reached their limits and can provide no more active
control, rectal temperature seems to respond to variations of clothing, work, and
environmental conditions (Givoni and Goldman, 1972).
Equilibrium temperature is defined as the temperature reached by the body after all
changes have been completed. Equilibrium temperature may require body temperature to
move to lethal levels. In such a case, thermal responses of the body will drive body
temperature toward the equilibrium temperature, and death will result, unless changes are
made in work, environment, or clothing. Equilibrium temperature is assumed to be prescribed
by factors in the basic heat balance Equation (5.1.2). These factors are (Givoni and Goldman,
1972) (1) metabolic heat load, (2) radiation and convection beat gain or loss, and (3) the
difference between required sweating rate and evaporative capacity of the air. Each is
discussed in turn.
Metabolic Heat Load. Metabolic heat load was discussed in Section 5.2.5. Muscular
metabolic heat load is the difference between energy required by the muscles and the energy
equivalent of external work. Givoni and Goldman (1972) have given an empirical equation for
heat production for men walking on any terrain at any speed at any grade:

M = 0.10ζW{2.7 + 3.2(s – 0.7)1.65 + 100G[0.23 + 0.29(s – 0.7)]} – WsG

where M = net metabolic heat load for walking, N·m/sec
ζ = terrain factor, dimensionless
W = total weight (body + load + clothing), N
s = speed of walking, m/sec
G = fractional (not percent) grade, dimensionless

(5.5.1)


437

The term WsG represents the rate of external physical work accomplished by the muscles: this
muscular power is transferred into increased potential energy and does not constitute a heat
burden on the body, This formula has been claimed (Givoni and Goldman, 1972) to be usable
for running with energy costs up to 1400 N·m/sec, but it cannot be used for walking speeds
below 0.7 m/sec, where it is difficult to maintain a smooth movement pattern. For comfort, M
should be maintained in the range of 290–525 N·m/sec for average men (Goldman, 1975). At
rest a constant value of 105 N·m/sec can be assumed for M.
For the case of downhill walking, leading to negative work, Goldman (1988) indicated
that the grade is taken to be a positive number (see Section 5.2.5 for heat production of a
muscle performing negative work) and the physical work rate is added to, rather than
subtracted from, the expression for metabolic heat load.
Terrain coefficients ζ are corrections applied to terrain surfaces to correct for the
increased metabolic cost of walking on these surfaces compared to walking on the treadmill,
where Equation 5.5.1 was developed. Values of terrain coefficients valid for men carrying
loads of 100–400 N appear in Table 5.5. 1.
The weight W to be used in Equation 5.5.1 is the total weight carried, including nude
weight, clothing weight, and load carried. It has been found, however, that placement of the
load carried will affect the metabolic cost of the load (Soule and Goldman, 1969). Placing the
load on the head did not appreciably affect the metabolic rate over that which it would have
been had the weight been body weight; placing the load in the hands increased the metabolic
cost somewhat; and placing it on the feet increased it greatly. Givoni and Goldman (1971)
suggested a correction factor for Equation 5.5.1 which can be used to account for load
placement:
M′ = M + K Wl2 s2

(5.5.2)

where M′ = heat production with load placement correction, N·m/sec
M = walking metabolic load from Equation 5.5.1, N·m/sec
K = proportionality factor, sec/(N·m)
Wl = weight of load, N
s = walking speed, m/sec
Givoni and Goldman (1971) use K = 5.51 x 10-3 sec/(N·m) [0.015 hr/(km·kg)] for loads in the
hands, and K = 23.5 x 10-3 sec/(N·m) [0.064 hr/(km·kg)] for loads on the feet. In the
computation of the correction for loads on the feet, only deviations from the weight of

standard army service boots (15 N, or 1.5 kg) should be taken into account. They indicate that
since usual shoes normally weigh 10 N, this adjustment can be omitted with little error. Extra
layers of clothing significantly increase metabolic cost, but the increase cannot be attributed
entirely to displacement of the load from the axis of the torso (Teitlebaum and Goldman,
1972). Perhaps this effect is due to friction between clothing layers and increased interference
of the clothing with natural movement.
Very heavy loads seem to require a disproportionately high amount of energy to carry
(Givoni and Goldman, 1971). When the product of the load carried Wl times the speed of
walking s exceeds 270 N·m/sec (100 kg·km/hr), a correction is required. If Wls < 270 N·m/sec,
no correction should appear:
M" = M + 0.147 (Wls – 270),

Wls > 270

(5.5.3)

where M" = heat production with heavy load correction, N·m/sec
Givoni and Goldman (1971) also corrected Equation 5.5.1 for heat production while
running. They indicate that below an energy cost (external work plus heat production) of
about 1000 N·m/sec (900 kcal/hr) walking is more efficient than running (see Figure 2.4.5).
Above 1000 N·m/sec, running is more efficient. They thus propose the required running
correction to be
M′" = [M + 0.47 (1047 – M)] [1 + G]

(5.5.4)

where M′" = heat production for running, N·m/sec
Pandolf et al. (1977) developed an equation for energy expenditure for the same
conditions of Equation 5.5.1, except that it does not suffer from the lower walking speed limit
of 0.7 m/sec. This equation has five components: (1) metabolic cost of standing without load
(calculated as 0.15 N·m/sec per newton of body weight), (2) metabolic cost of standing with a
load, (3) metabolic cost of walking on the level, (4) metabolic cost of climbing a grade, and
(5) external work. This formula is
M = 0.15Wb + 0.20(Wb + Wl)(Wl /Wb)2

+ 0.102ζ(Wb + Wl)(1.5s2 + 35sG) – (Wl + Wb)sG

(5.5.5)

where Wb = body weight, N
Wl = load weight, N
Although this equation does predict metabolic cost of walking over a wider range of speeds
than does Equation 5.5.1, the corrections represented by Equations 5.5.2–5.5.4 have not been
validated for use with Equation 5.5.5.
Equation 5.5.5 predicts equal metabolic costs of certain combinations of carried load and
walking speed. That is, heavier loads are accompanied by slower speeds. Myles and Saunders
(1979) investigated the implications of this equation by testing men carrying different loads at
different speeds. Their results confirm that the metabolic cost of load-carrying can indeed be
predicted by the methods of Pandolf et al. (1977), and that walking speeds can be adjusted to
give the same metabolic costs for heavier loads as with lighter loads. However, there is an
extra cost to the cardiopulmonary system of the heavier loads: heart rates for the heavier loads
were higher despite equal metabolic costs with lighter loads and higher speeds; breathing rates
and minute volumes were higher as well. Ratings of perceived exertion39 were higher for
heavier loads, again despite an equal metabolic cost.
39
Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), also called reported perceived exertion, measure the intensity of work as apparent to the
worker. This is a mental perception of work instead of a physiological measurement. It is postulated that RPE reflects feelings
of strain derived from the two sources of the working muscles and the cardiopulmonary system, but the scale was originally
selected to correspond to heart rate divided by 10 (Goldman, 1978a; Myles and Saunders, 1979).


439

Radiation and Convection Heat Exchange. Radiation and convection were discussed in
Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2. That information is relevant here. However, Givoni and Goldman
(1972) use a different set of clothing thermal conductance (Ccl) values which include the
thermal resistance of a still air layer. Thus the thermal resistances of conduction through
clothing and convection through the boundary layer of air, as diagramed in Figure 5.2.1, are
combined in their equations. Because body movement as well as wind reduces the insulation
value of the surrounding still air layer, a correction must be applied whenever air movement is
present.
Givoni and Goldman also assumed a mean radiant temperature equal to the air
temperature, so that radiation and convection can be combined; and a mean skin temperature
of clothed men in hot environments to be 36oC. Their basic convective and radiative heat
exchange equation is

(qr + qc) = (CclA)(θa – 36)

(5.5.6)

Correction for wind and relative air movement caused by motion of the body and limbs
through the air has been estimated by
veff = v + 0.004(M – 105)

(5.5.7)

where veff = effective air speed, m/sec
v = wind speed, m/sec
(M – 105) = total metabolic rate above the resting level, N·m/sec
M = total metabolic rate, which may include all corrections M', M", and M"', N·m/sec
and tabulated clothing thermal conductance values are multiplied by the "pumping
coefficient," which takes values between v0.2 and v0.3. Table 5.5.2 includes several of these
effective Ccl values.
Sweating. Required evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature equilibrium is just the
sum of the physical heat exchange and net metabolic heat load:

Ereq = M + (qr + qc)

(5.5.8)

where Ereq = required evaporative cooling, N·m/sec
Evaporative capacity of the environment depends on the water vapor pressure of the air
[obtainable from a psychrometric chart and Equation 5.2.59 and the ability of water vapor to
pass through the clothing (im)]. Making use of the Lewis relation value developed in Section
5.2.4, evaporative capacity is given by (Givoni and Goldman, 1972; Goldman, 1975)
Emax = 0.0165AimCcl (psk – pH2O)

where Emax = maximum evaporative heat loss, N·m/sec
psk = vapor pressure of water at the average skin temperature; for θsk =36oC, psk =
5866 N/m2
pH2O = vapor pressure of air, N/m2
A = body surface area, = 1.8 m2
If the vapor pressure of the air is above the vapor pressure of the skin, condensation appears
on the skin, and the heat of condensation is added to the entire body heat load. Fortunately,
this is a very rare occurrence.
Sweating effectiveness depends on where sweat evaporates. In hot, dry environments, air
water vapor pressure will be low, and the maximum evaporative heat loss able to be supported
by the environment (Emax) will be very high, far exceeding the required level of evaporative
heat loss (Ereq). Under these conditions, sweat will evaporate at the skin surface and the
percentage of wetted skin area will be low. High air water vapor pressures, caused either by
humid ambient conditions or by water-impermeable clothing, require higher percentages of
wetted skin area in order to satisfy Ereq. This leads to sweat accumulation which drips from the
skin.
Shapiro et al. (1982) developed an empirical equation predicting rate of sweating for fully
heat-acclimatized men:
-6
–0.455
,
m sw = 7.75 x 10 Ereq (Emax/A)

50 < ( Ereq/A) < 360; 20 < ( Emax/A) < 525
(5.5.10)

where m sw = rate of sweat mass production, kg/sec
The authors compared predictions from this equation with those by others (most notably
the predicted four-hour sweat rate, or P4SR) and found good agreement. This equation,
however, has a wider range of applicability.
Equilibrium Body Temperature. Experimental testing and insertion of empirical data
have yielded the following equation for final rectal temperature for resting or working men
(Givoni and Goldman, 1972):

θrf = 36.75 + 0.004 M + (0.00217Acl)(θa – 36) + 0.8exp[0.0047(Ereq – Emax)]

(5.5.11)

where θrf = final (equilibrium) rectal temperature, oC
Here, the 36.75 equals the equilibrium rectal temperature corresponding to the basal metabolic
rate and the net metabolic rate M may include all corrections in M', M", and M'". For resting
men with a metabolic rate of 105 N·m/sec in an ambient environment of 36oC, rectal
temperature becomes 37.15oC.
Below an ambient temperature of 30oC, rectal temperature appears to be independent of
the temperature of the environment. Thus equilibrium rectal temperature can be predicted
from Equation 5.5.11 for any temperature below 30oC (at least down to 15oC) by assuming an
ambient temperature value of 30oC.
For comfort, rectal temperature must be less than 38.2oC. There is a 25% risk of heat
casualties for unacclimatized men at a rectal temperature of 39.2oC, a 50% risk at 39.5oC, and
nearly 100% risk at 40oC (Goldman, 1975).
5.5.2

Variation of Rectal Temperature with Time

An infinite amount of heat would be required to instantly raise deep body temperature. Time
changes in body temperature depend on many environmental and metabolic factors and are
usually characterized by a period of no observable change, an almost exponential change, and
a final period of equilibrium. There are three distinct conditions which have been analyzed by
Givoni and Goldman (1972). Each is considered in turn.


441

Changes at Rest Under Heat Stress. When climatic conditions are changed during rest,
there is an appreciable time during which no detectable change in rectal temperature occurs.
This is especially true for an increase in heat stress. The rate of change at first is slow, then
accelerates, and finally diminishes while approaching the new equilibrium level. This
complex pattern can be described by (Givoni and Goldman, 1972)

θr = θr0 + (θ rf −θ r 0 )(0.1) 0.4[t −1800 / 3600]

(5.5.12)

where θr = predicted rectal temperature at any time, oC
θr0 = rectal temperature when the change first occurs in environmental heat stress, oC
θrf = final rectal temperature, oC
t = time, sec
The complex exponent 0.4[(t – 18000) / 3600] allows prediction at changing rates and gives about
1800 sec (30 min) for the initial time lag when the change is only 10% complete. Time t
begins when resting begins. When t approaches infinity, θr approaches θrf. It is possible to
estimate the initial resting temperature of young, healthy, heat-acclimatized men by (Givoni
and Goldman, 1972)
θr0 = 36 + 0.0015W

(5.5.13)

where W = body weight, N
This equation will give only an estimate, however; it will not yield normal variations due to
season, time of day, activities of the previous day and night, and emotional influences.
Elevation During Work. Experiments have shown that rectal temperature during work
again does not change immediately, and, in fact, shows no influence of the increase in
metabolic rate for quite some time. This time lag becomes shorter as the metabolic rate
becomes higher. This was expressed in the form (Givoni and Goldman, 1972)

tdw = 208,800/M

(5.5.14)

where tdw = delay time in onset of increase of rectal temperature during work, sec
M = total metabolic rate, including external work, N·m/sec
During this period of time, rectal temperature continues to follow the pattern determined by
the previous work condition. For work which begins after rest, rectal temperature during the
time lag should be computed as if the man were still resting (Equation 5.5.12).
Following the time delay, rectal temperature begins to increase with a time constant that
varies directly as the total expected rectal temperature change: a small total change in rectal
temperature will be completed in a shorter length of time than a larger change. For a time
constant of fixed value, the time for the change to be complete does not depend on the total
expected rectal temperature increase. Therefore, a variable time constant was proposed:

τw=

3600
2 − 0.5 θ rf −θ r 0

(5.5.15a)

where τw = time constant of rectal temperature increase during work, sec
Berlin (1975) reported that Goldman has used an alternate form for τw:

τw=

3600

(5.5.15b)
0.5+1.5e −0.3(θ rf −θ r 0 )
Givoni and Goldman indicated that to avoid the possibility that τw could become negative


442

under extreme conditions, they calculate τw by

τw=

1800
e

−0.17 (θ rf −θ r 0 )

(5.5.15c)

Goldman (1988) indicated that the time constant currently is simply restrained from assuming
negative values.
Rectal temperature during work, after the initial delay time, can be computed from
(Givoni and Goldman, 1972)

θ r =θ r 0 + (θ rf −θ r 0 )(1− e −(t −tdw ) / τ w )

(5.5.16)

where the time t begins when the work is initiated and the new equilibrium rectal temperature
θrf must be computed from Equation 5.5.11 for the conditions of work.
Recovery After Work. During recovery from work, the body temperature at first continues
to climb and then falls toward the resting value predicted by Equation 5.5.11 for resting
conditions. The initial rate of rise in body temperature is probably due to local cooling of the
skin by vasodilation and sweating. Without the benefit of as much warming as during work,
evaporation of accumulated sweat cools the skin below a point at which local reflex action
reduces sweating and perhaps even causes vasoconstriction. Residual heat from the muscles is
therefore restricted from escaping, and body temperature rises. This occurs during a recovery
delay time of

tdr = 900e-0.5CP

(5.5.17)

where tdr = delay time in onset of cooling during recovery, sec
CP = effective cooling power of the environment, N·m/sec
CP = 0.015[0.7Emax + (qr + qc) – 105]

(5.5.18)

where Emax = evaporative cooling capacity of the environment, N·m/sec
Here, evaporative cooling has been assumed to be an average of 70% of maximum
evaporative capacity. The resting metabolic rate of 105 N·m/sec has been subtracted from
evaporative, convective, and radiative heat losses. Combining Equation 5.5.18 with Equations
5.5.8 and 5.5.9 gives
CP = 1.73 x 10-4im CclA(pe – pa) – 0.0150A(θa – 36)Ccl – 1.57

(5.5.19)

During this delay time tdr, rectal temperature is assumed to rise one-half as rapidly as
predicted from Equation 5.5.16 during work. Thus Equation 5.5.16 would be used to calculate
rectal temperature at the end of the period of work, the same equation would be used to
predict a rectal temperature during the recovery delay time as if work had not ceased, and the
actual rectal temperature during the recovery delay time would be the calculated temperature
at the end of work plus one-half the difference between temperature during recovery and at
the end of work:
θr = + 0.5(θrww – θrw)

(5.5.20)

where θr = rectal temperature during recovery delay time, oC
θrw = predicted rectal temperature at the end of working period, oC
θrww = rectal temperature during the recovery period delay time predicted as if working
were still continuing, oC


443

After the initial rectal temperature rise during recovery, cooling begins. This cooling also
occurs at a variable rate described by a time constant (Givoni and Goldman, 1972):

τr =

3600
1.5(1− e −1.5CP )

(5.5.21)

and rectal temperature during recovery is
θr = θr0 – (θr0 – θrf)(1 – e − (t − tdr ) / τ r )

(5.5.22)

where θr0 is the highest temperature obtained during recovery. It is calculated from Equations
5.5.16 and 5.5.20 assuming a total time in Equation 5.5.16 of the entire time of working plus
the entire recovery delay time tdr.
Effect of Acclimatization. Predicted final rectal temperature from Equation 5.5.11 is valid
only for acclimatized men. Givoni and Goldman (1973) found that resting rectal temperatures
are an average of 0.5oC lower for acclimatized men compared to unacclimatized men. Further,
rectal temperature in the heat for working acclimatized men is a maximum of 1.2oC lower
than for unacclimatized men (Figure 5.5.1). This acclimatization process occurs over a
number of days, with the number of consecutive days of work experience being reduced onehalf day for each day missed. Givoni and Goldman (1973) present this correction40 to
Equation 5.5.11:

θrf(unacc) = θrf(acc) + [0.5 + 1.2(1 – e −0.5(θ rf (acc) − 37.15) )]e–0.3N

(5.5.23)

where θrf(unacc) = unacclimatized equilibrium rectal temperature, oC
θrf(acc) = acclimatized equilibrium rectal temperature calculated from Equation 5.5.11,
o

N = number of consecutive days work in heat minus half the number of days
skipped, days

49oC, 20% relative humidity, at 1.6 m/sec. Solid lines are model predictions. Circles are subject data.

40
Givoni and Goldman assumed acclimatization to be complete after 6 days working in the heat. Their equation does not predict
acclimatization to be complete until 12–15 days.


444

Givoni and Goldman (1973) also assumed acclimatization effects to be caused partially by
higher circulatory efficiency and partially by a higher sweat production rate. When
evaporation is restricted, especially by impermeable clothing, low air movement, or high
ambient humidity, sweating acclimatization is of less consequence. To account for this effect,
θrf(unacc) = θrf(acc) + [0.5 + 1.2(1 – e −0.5(θ rf (acc) − 37.15) )][e–0.3N][1 – e −0.005 Emax ] (5.5.24)
where Emax is computed according to Equation 5.5.9. With these changes in equilibrium rectal
temperature, the time pattern of rectal temperature change occurs in the same manner as
before and can be calculated from Equations 5.5.12, 5.5.16, and 5.5.21.
5.5.3

Model Limitations and Performance

This model has been tested by a large number of experiments and found to give good fit
(Givoni and Goldman, 1972). In Figure 5.5.2 the agreement between predicted and actual
equilibrium rectal temperatures is seen; in the upper left, data produced in studies by Givoni
and Goldman (1972) for men resting, walking up a I% grade, and walking up an 8% grade are

conditions are compared in the middle right, Figure 5.5.2c is the comparison for data by
Wissler (1963) for different rates of step work; in the lower left is the comparison for data by
Goldman et al. (1965) for resting men in hot, humid environments; and in the lower right
resting and walking data by Givoni (1963) are compared.
The comparison for time patterns of rectal temperature appear in Figure 5.5.3 for a cycle
of rest, work, and recovery, and in Figure 5.5.4 for a cycle of work, recovery, work, and
recovery. In both figures the period of work is indicated.
The model, however, does have limitations, which are discussed by Goldman (1975).
Effects of sex are not known; effects of load carriage are not completely known; sweat
inefficiencies due to evaporation inside the clothing and accumulation in some areas have not
been incorporated, that is, the model assumes equivalence for all sweating areas, but some
areas seem to be more likely to sweat than others; conductance from core to skin has been
assumed, but this requires validation; effects of age, physical condition, and motivation have
not been adequately studied. This model does not completely describe the physiology of
hyperthermia. Nevertheless, for many purposes this model adequately predicts rectal
temperature for young, reasonably fit males.
