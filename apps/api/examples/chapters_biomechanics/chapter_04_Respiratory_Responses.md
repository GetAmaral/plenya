CHAPTER 4
Respiratory Responses
Air which has thus served the purpose of animal respiration is no longer common air; it approaches
to the nature of fixed air [air containing CO2 and not O2] in as much as it is capable of combining
with lime-water and precipitating the lime from it, in the form of a calcareous earth; but it differs
from fixed air.
—Antoine Lavoisier describing the work of Priestley

INTRODUCTION

Of all the bodily functions performed during exercise, respiration appears to be one of the
most highly regulated and optimized. The amount of work performed by respiratory muscles
to supply air for the exercising body can be considered to be a large part of the body's
overhead. Respiratory work, which accounts for 1–2% of the total body oxygen expenditure
during rest, may rise to as much as 10% or higher during exercise. This represents oxygen that
is unavailable to the skeletal muscles for performing useful work. It appears reasonable,
therefore, that neural mechanisms regulating respiration would aim to minimize the work of
respiration. Simultaneous adjustments in airflow pattern, respiration rate, and respiratory
mechanics appear to be directed toward minimizing oxygen expenditure of respiratory
overhead.
Respiratory ventilation during rest is subject to a high degree of voluntary control. In
exercise this does not appear to be true. Except for specialized sports such as swimming
(where breathing must be synchronized to gulp air, not water) and weight lifting (where
breath-holding is practiced to increase torso rigidity), respiration during exercise appears to be
very highly deterministic; conscious control is difficult and usually not brought to bear. We
thus find that models to predict respiratory responses usually match experimental findings
very well. Even where external events such as stepping during running and pedaling during
bicycling tend to synchronize breathing, many respiratory parameters can be predicted.
As in other chapters, mechanics and control are introduced before models are presented.
The reader should note the similarity (and coupling; Whipp and Ward, 1982) between
cardiovascular and respiratory mechanics and control. Both systems propel fluids, both have
conducting passageways, and both represent support functions not directly involved in useful
external work. Therefore, both are subject to some degree of optimization to reduce the
burden of support during exercise.
4.2 RESPIRATORY MECHANICS
Respiratory mechanics, perhaps more than mechanics of other systems in this book, is an
extremely complicated topic. The respiratory system, we all know, functions to bring air to the
blood. It also functions to maintain thermal equilibrium and acid-base balance of the blood.
Even while its primary function of air movement is occurring, there are gaseous fluid

166

mechanics, physical diffusion, gas-to-liquid mass transport, muscular movement, and neural
integration to consider. Although it can be argued that many of the same processes occur in
the cardiovascular system, for instance, it was convenient to ignore all but those that were in
consonance with the theme of this book. These mechanisms are intrinsic to respiratory
functioning, however, and it is not possible to ignore them. Therefore, a slightly less
integrated approach has been taken for respiratory matters compared to cardiovascular and
thermal studies.
Mechanical properties of the respiratory system are best understood by first reviewing
respiratory anatomy. Following that, it will be clearer how various mechanical models are
formulated to account for structural considerations.
4.2.1

Respiratory Anatomy

The respiratory system consists of the lungs, conducting airways, pulmonary vasculature,
respiratory muscles, and surrounding tissues and structures (Figure 4.2.1). Each of these is
discussed to show the ways in which it influences respiratory responses.
Lungs. There are two lungs in the human chest; the right lung is composed of three
incomplete divisions called lobes and the left lung has two.1 The right lung accounts for 55%
of total gas volume and the left lung accounts for 45%. Lung tissue is spongy because of the
very small (200-300 x 10-6 m diameter in normal lungs at rest) gas-filled cavities called
alveoli, which are the ultimate structures for gas exchange. There are 250 million to 350

million alveoli in the adult lung, with a total alveolar surface area of 50–100 m2 depending on
the degree of lung inflation (Hildebrandt and Young, 1966).
Conducting Airways. Air is transported from the atmosphere to the alveoli beginning with
the oral and nasal cavities, and through the pharynx (in the throat) past the glottal opening,
into the trachea, or windpipe. The larynx, or voice box, at the entrance to the trachea, is the
most distal structure of the passages solely for conduction of air. The trachea is a
fibromuscular tube 10–12 cm in length and 1.4–2.0 cm in diameter (Sackner, 1976a). At a
location called the carina, the trachea terminates and divides into the left and right bronchi.
Each bronchus has a discontinuous cartilaginous support in its wall (Astrand and Rodahl,
1970). Muscle fibers capable of controlling airway diameter are incorporated into the walls of
the bronchi, as well as in those of air passages closer to the alveoli. The general tendency of
airways closer to the alveoli is to be less rigid and more controllable by muscle fibers (Table
4.2.1). Smooth muscle is present throughout the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts but
is absent in the last alveolar duct, which terminates in one to several alveoli (Sackner, 1976a).
The alveolar walls are shared by other alveoli and are composed of highly pliable and
collapsible squamous epithelium cells.
The bronchi subdivide into subbronchi, which further subdivide into bronchioles, which
further subdivide, and so on, until finally reaching the alveolar level. The Weibel model is
commonly accepted as one geometrical arrangement of air passages (another more

complicated asymmetrical model is described in Yeates and Aspin, 1978). In this model
(Figure 4.2.2), each airway is considered to branch into two subairways. In the adult human
there are considered to be 23 such branchings, or generations, beginning at the trachea and
ending in the alveoli.
Dichotomous branching is considered to occur only through the first 16 generations,
which is called the conductive zone because these airways serve to conduct air to and from the
lungs.2 After the sixteenth generation branching proceeds irregularly dichotomously or
trichotomously for three generations. A limited amount of respiratory gas exchange occurs in
this transition zone. In the respiration zone, generations 20–23, most gas exchange occurs.3
Movement of gases in the respiratory airways occurs mainly by bulk flow (convection)
throughout the region from the mouth and nose to the fifteenth generation (Figure 4.2.3).
Beyond the fifteenth generation, gas diffusion is relatively more important (Pedley et al.,
1977; Sackner, 1976a).4 With the low gas velocities that occur in diffusion, dimensions of the
space over which diffusion occurs (alveolar space) must be small for adequate oxygen
delivery to the walls; smaller alveoli are more efficient in the transfer of gas than are larger
ones.5 Thus animals with high levels of oxygen consumption are found to have smaller
diameter alveoli compared to animals with low levels of oxygen consumption (Figure 4.2.4).
2
The airways also serve to temper air conditions by (usually) heating and humidifying the air and removing dust particles (see
Chapter 5 for thermal effects). In cold weather, some of the moisture added to the air is recovered by condensation in the
nostrils, thus leading to a runny nose.
3
About 2% of the oxygen consumption at rest, and a slightly larger percentage of carbon dioxide lost, occurs in humans by
diffusion through the skin (Hildebrandt and Young, 1966).
4
Radial gaseous diffusion in the upper airways appears to be much more important in gas mixing and flow than axial gaseous
diffusion (Pedley et al., 1977).
5
When lung inflation doubles, as during exercise, the nearly spherical alveoli increase their diameters by only 1.3. Thus
diffusion distances do not change greatly.

Alveoli. Alveoli are the structures through which gases diffuse to and from the body. One
would expect, then, that alveolar walls would be extremely thin for gas exchange efficiency,
and that is found to be the case. Total tissue thickness between the inside of the alveolus to
pulmonary capillary blood plasma is only about 0.4 x 10-6 m (Figure 4.2.5). From the relative
dimensions, it is apparent that the principal barrier to diffusion is not the alveolar membrane
but the plasma and red blood cell (Hildebrandt and Young, 1966).
Molecular diffusion within the alveolar volume is responsible for mixing of the enclosed
gas. Due to the small alveolar dimensions, complete mixing probably occurs in less than
10 msec (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970), fast enough that alveolar mixing time does not limit
gaseous diffusion to or from the blood.
Of particular importance to proper alveolar operation is a thin surface coating of
surfactant. Without this material, large alveoli would tend to enlarge and small alveoli would
collapse. From the law of Laplace (see Section 3.2.3) for spherical bubbles

bubble are driven into the larger one. If we generalize this instability to the lung, it is not hard
to imagine the lung composed of one large, expanded alveolus and many small, collapsed
alveoli. Surfactant, which acts like a detergent, changes the stress-strain relationship of the
alveolar wall and stabilizes the lung (Notter and Finkelstein, 1984).6
Pulmonary Circulation. The pulmonary circulation is relatively low pressure (Fung and
Sobin, 1977). Because of this, pulmonary blood vessels, especially capillaries and venules, are
very thin walled and flexible. Unlike systemic capillaries, pulmonary capillaries increase in
diameter with any increase in blood pressure or decrease in alveolar pressure. Flow, therefore,
is significantly influenced by elastic deformation.
Pulmonary circulation is largely unaffected by neural and chemical control (Fung and
Sobin, 1977). It responds promptly to hypoxia, however. And a key anatomical consideration
is that pulmonary capillaries within alveolar walls are exposed to alveolar air on both sides,
since alveolar walls separate adjacent alveoli.
There is no true pulmonary analog to the systemic arterioles (Fung and Sobin, 1977).
6
Surfactant is always present on the surface of the alveoli of healthy individuals. Sighs or yawns may function by stretching
closed alveoli and spreading surfactant across their surfaces so they will stay open. This contention is disputed by Provine et al.
(1987). Lung surfactant is likely to be dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline, or DPPC (Mines, 1981).

That is, the pressure-reduction function performed by the systemic arterioles (see Section
3.2.2) is not matched by the pulmonary arterioles. Therefore, pulmonary vessels, including
capillaries and venules, exhibit blood pressures that vary approximately 30–50% from systole
to diastole (Fung and Sobin, 1977).
There is also a high-pressure systemic blood delivery system to the bronchi which is
completely independent of the pulmonary low-pressure ( ~ 3330 N/m2) circulation in healthy
individuals (Fung and Sobin, 1977). In diseased states, however, bronchial arteries are
reported to enlarge when pulmonary blood flow is reduced, and some arteriovenous shunts
become prominent (Fung and Sobin, 1977).
Total pulmonary blood volume is approximately 300–500cm3 in normal adults (Sackner,
1976c) with about 60–100 cm3 in the pulmonary capillaries (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). This
value is quite variable, depending on such things as posture, position, disease, and chemical
composition of the blood (Sackner, 1976c).
Pulmonary arterial blood is oxygen-poor and carbon dioxide-rich. It exchanges excess
carbon dioxide for oxygen in the pulmonary capillaries, which are in close contact with
alveolar walls.
At rest, the transit time for blood in the pulmonary capillaries,

where t = blood transit time, sec
Vc = capillary blood volume, m3
VDc = total capillary blood flow

is somewhat less than 1 sec (Table 4.2.2).
Carbon dioxide diffusion is so rapid that carbon dioxide partial pressure in the blood is
equilibrated to that in the alveolus by 100 msec after the blood enters the capillary and oxygen
equilibrium is reached by 500 msec (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
At rest, pulmonary venous blood returns to the heart nearly 97% saturated with oxygen.7
During exercise blood transit time in the capillaries may be only 500 msec or even less
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970), and hemoglobin saturation (see Section 3.2.1) may be limited
because blood transit time is not long enough.
Respiratory Muscles. The lungs fill because of a rhythmic expansion of the chest wall.
The action is indirect in that no muscle acts directly on the lung.
The diaphragm is the muscular mass accounting for 75% of the expansion of the chest
cavity (Ganong, 1963). The diaphragm is attached around the bottom of the thoracic cage,
arches over the liver, and moves downward like a piston when it contracts (Ganong, 1963).
The external intercostal muscles are positioned between the ribs and aid inspiration by moving
the ribs up and forward. This, then, increases the volume of the thorax. Other muscles (Table
4.2.3) are important in the maintenance of thoracic shape during breathing.

This figure would be closer to 100% if pulmonary anastomoses and some nonventilated alveoli were not present.

Quiet expiration8 is usually considered to be entirely passive: pressure to force air from
the lungs comes from elastic expansion of the lungs and chest wall. Actually, there is evidence
(Hämäläinen and Viljanen, 1978a; Loring and Mead, 1982; McIlroy et al., 1963) that even
quiet expiration is not entirely passive. Sometimes, too, inspiratory muscle activity continues
through the early part of expiration.9 During moderate to severe exercise, the abdominal and
internal intercostal muscles are very important in forcing air from the lungs much more
quickly than would otherwise occur.
Inspiration requires intimate contact between lung tissues, pleural tissues (the pleura is
the membrane surrounding the lungs), and chest wall and diaphragm. This contact is
maintained by reduced intrathoracic pressure (which tends toward negative values during
inspiration). Any accumulation of gas in the intrapleural space in the thorax, which would ruin
tissue-to-tissue contact, is absorbed into the pulmonary circulation because pulmonary venous
total gas pressure is subatmospheric (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
The diaphragm is the respiratory muscle of most importance in developing the muscle
pressure required to move air in the lungs. Its shape is largely determined because it separates
the air-filled, spongy, and easily deformed lung material from the largely liquid abdominal
contents. Because of the difference in height of the liquid in the abdomen across the dome
shape assumed by the diaphragm, there is a significant vertical hydrostatic pressure gradient in
the abdomen and a consequent difference in transdiaphragmatic pressure over the surface of
the diaphragm (Whitelaw et al., 1983). Diaphragm tension should be able to be determined
from its shape by the law of Laplace (Equation 4.2.1).
As the lungs fill, they become stiffer. The diaphragm must be able to produce higher
pressures in order to move air into filled lungs. Normally, this would run counter to the
muscular length-tension (Section 5.2.5) relationship, which indicates higher muscular tensions
for longer lengths. In any case, muscular efficiencies would be expected to change during the
respiratory cycle and muscle pressures exerted on the lungs would be expected to vary with
position.
4.2.2 Lung Volumes and Gas Exchange

Of primary importance to lung functioning is the movement and mixing of gases within the
respiratory system. Depending on the anatomical level under consideration, gas movement is
determined mainly by diffusion or convection. This discussion begins with determinants of
convective gaseous processes, that is, the lung volumes which change from rest to exercise.

The terms exhalation and expiration, and the terms inhalation and inspiration, are used completely synonymously in this book.
Both forms are derived from Latin roots meaning to breathe (-halare and -spirare).

175

Lung Volumes. Without the thoracic musculature and rib cage, the barely inflated lungs
would occupy a much smaller space than they occupy in situ. However, the thoracic cage
holds them open. Conversely, the lungs exert an influence on the thorax, holding it smaller
than should be the case without the lungs. Because the lungs and thorax are connected by
tissue, the volume occupied by both together is between the extremes represented by relaxed
lungs alone and thoracic cavity alone. The resting volume Vr is that volume occupied by the
lungs with glottis10 open, muscles relaxed, and with no elastic tendency to become larger or
smaller.
Functional residual capacity (FRC) is often taken to be the same as the resting volume.
There is a small difference between resting volume and FRC because FRC is measured while
the patient breathes, whereas resting volume is measured with no breathing.11 FRC is properly
defined only at end-expiration at rest and not during exercise.
Tidal volume VT is the amount of air exhaled12 at each breath. Tidal volume increases as
the severity of exercise increases. Dividing VT by respiratory period (the time between
identical points of successive breaths) T gives the minute volume VDE , or the amount of air
that would be exhaled per unit time if exhalation could be sustained. Sometimes VD , is
E

measured as accumulated exhaled air for one minute.
Lung volumes greater than resting volume are achieved during inspiration. Maximum
inspiration is represented by inspiratory reserve volume (IRV). IRV is the maximum
additional volume that can be accommodated by the lung at the end of inspiration.
Lung volumes less than resting volume do not normally occur at rest but do occur during
exhalation while exercising (when exhalation is active). Maximum additional expiration, as
measured from lung volume at the end of expiration, is called expiratory reserve volume
(ERV).
A small amount of air remains in the lung at maximum expiratory effort. This is the
residual volume (RV).
Vital capacity (VC) is the sum of ERV, IRV, and VT. Total lung capacity (TLC) equals
VC plus RV. These volumes are illustrated in Figure 4.2.6.
Tidal volume ventilates both the active (alveolar) regions of the lung, composed of
alveolar ventilation volume VA, and inactive regions, called dead volume VD, or dead space.
Alveolar ventilation volume consists of air that diffuses to and from the pulmonary
circulation. Respiratory dead volume is air that does not take part in gas exchange. Not all air
that reaches the alveoli interacts with gases in the blood, and thus there is a portion of the total
dead volume known as alveolar dead volume. The volume occupied by the respiratory system
exclusive of the alveoli is normally called anatomic dead volume. The volume of gas not
equilibrating with the blood is called physiological dead volume. Normally, anatomical and
physiological dead volumes are nearly identical, but during certain diseases, when portions of
the lung are unperfused by blood, they can differ significantly.
Dead volume is important because it represents wasted respiratory effort. During
exhalation, the most oxygen-poor and carbon dioxide-rich air is the last to be expelled (socalled end-tidal air). Because of the accumulation of this air in the dead volume (Tatsis et al.,
1984), this is the first air to be drawn back into the alveoli.13 Extra respiratory effort must be
expended to overcome dead volume accumulation.
Alveolar volume increases during exercise because of increased alveolar inflation and
10
The glottis is the opening between the vocal cords in the larynx. The epiglottis is the small flap of cartilaginous and
membranous tissue that closes off the windpipe during swallowing.
11
At rest, exhalation is assumed to be passive, and the shape of the flow waveform is therefore exponential. It takes an infinite
amount of time for all air above the resting volume to be expelled. The small amount of excess air that remains in the lungs
upon initiation of inspiration, when added to resting volume, equals FRC.
12
Some people define tidal volume as the amount of air inhaled during each breath. The two volumes are not the same because
of the different temperatures of the inhaled and exhaled air, and, to a lesser extent, due to water vapor addition and different gas
composition of exhaled air. Inhaled volume is somewhat easier to measure because higher resting flow rates are usually
incurred.

recruitment of additional alveolar areas. Apparent dead volume increases because of these
same reasons, and because of different patterns of gas mixing in the lungs. When flow
becomes turbulent, as it does in regions of the conducting air passages as flow rate increases,
mixing is enhanced. Alveolar gas being mixed with freshly inhaled air is oxygen-poor and
carbon dioxide-rich; thus dead volume increases. Gray et al. (1956) measured the dependence
of dead volume on tidal volume for five subjects and obtained this relationship:
VD = 1.8 x 10-4 + 0.023VT

(4.2.3)

where VD = dead volume, m3
VT = tidal volume, m3
It can be seen, then, that the ratio of dead volume to tidal volume VD/VT decreases during
exercise when tidal volume increases (Whipp, 1981).
Normal values14 of all lung volumes are listed in Table 4.2.4. Subordinate volumes are
indented. Lung volumes are normally given in units of liters or milliliters, but to be consistent
with other chapters, cubic meters are used as primary units. Tabled volumes should be
multiplied by 0.76 for healthy females because lung volumes are related to body size (see
Section 5.2.6). Cerny (1987) also suggests race-related differences.
Posture affects many of these volumes through the influence of gravity. In a supine
position, gravity pulls on the upper thoracic wall, depressing lung volumes. In the standing
position, the effect of gravity is to expand lung volumes.
14
Schorr-Lesnick et al. (1985) compared pulmonary function tests, including lung volumes, between singers, wind-instrument
players, and other string or percussion instrumentalists. Contrary to popular opinion, no significant differences were found
among these groups. Singers, however, generally smoked less and exercised more than the others, thus evidence of heightened
awareness of health.

A reduction in lung tissue elasticity with age increases the relative proportion of residual
volume by reducing the recoil pressure driving expiration. The ratio of RV/TLC is about 20%
in young individuals but doubles in individuals 50-60 years of age (Astrand and Rodahl,
1970).
Perfuslon of the Lung. For gas exchange to occur properly in the lung, air must be
delivered to the alveoli via the conducting airways, gas must diffuse from the alveoli to the
capillaries through extremely thin walls, and the same gas must be removed to the cardiac
right atrium by blood flow. The first step in this three-step process is called ventilation, and
we have already been introduced to alveolar ventilation volume. When the time for alveolar
ventilation to happen is taken into account, alveolar ventilation rate results. The second step is
the process of diffusion.
The third step involves pulmonary blood flow, and this is called ventilatory perfusion.
Obviously, an alveolus which is ventilated but not perfused cannot exchange gas. Similarly, a
perfused alveolus which is not properly ventilated cannot exchange gas.15 The most efficient
gas exchange occurs when ventilation and perfusion are matched (Figure 4.2.7).
There is a wide range of ventilation-to-perfusion ratios that naturally occur in various
regions of the lung (Petrini, 1986). Blood flow is greatly affected by posture because of the
effects of gravity. In the upright position, there is a general reduction in the volume of blood
in the thorax, allowing for larger lung volume. Gravity also influences the distribution of
blood, such that the perfusion of equal lung volumes is about five times greater at the base
compared to the top of the lung (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). There is no corresponding
distribution of ventilation, hence the ventilation-to-perfusion ratio is nearly five times smaller
at the top of the lung (Table 4.2.5). A more uniform ventilation-to-perfusion ratio is found in
the supine position and during exercise (Jones, 1984b).
Blood flow through the capillaries is not steady. Rather, blood flows in a halting manner
and may even be stopped if intra-alveolar pressure exceeds intracapillary blood pressure
during diastole. Mean blood flow is not affected by heart rate (Fung and Sobin, 1977), but the

There is a much smaller blood circulation to the respiratory upper airways with the purpose of nourishing these airways. This
bronchial circulation is derived from the heart left ventricle rather than the right, which supplies blood to perfuse the lung
(Deffebach et al., 1987).

highly distensible pulmonary blood vessels admit more blood when blood pressure and
cardiac output increase. During exercise, higher pulmonary blood pressures allow more blood
to flow through the capillaries. Even mild exercise favors more uniform perfusion of the lungs
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure increases from 2670 N/m2
(20 mm Hg) at rest to 4670 N/m2 (35 mm Hg) during moderate exercise to 6670 N/m2
(50 mm Hg) at maximal work (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
Perfusion therefore is not steady, but average perfusion is generally all that is needed for
exercise studies. Even during heavy work some parts of the lungs may be unperfused during
diastole (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). However, as long as heart rate is many times the
respiration rate, average perfusion can still be close to ideal.
There are local mechanisms which tend to restore overall ventilation-to-perfusion ratios
to normal when local ratios are not ideal. Inadequate alveolar ventilation results in low oxygen
concentration. This, in turn, causes alveolar vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow,
shunting blood to better ventilated areas (Astrand and Rodahl, t970). Oppositely, reduced
blood flow produces low concentration of alveolar carbon dioxide, and this causes local
bronchiolar constriction (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Gas flow is thus shunted to better
perfused areas. These mechanisms are far from perfect, but they seem to be adequate for
matching blood flow to ventilated areas of the lung.
Gas Partial Pressures. The primary purpose of the respiratory system is gas exchange.
Yet we have already seen the complexity required to perform this function. Fresh air must be
brought to the alveolar gas exchange surface by an extensive piping network in order to
supply oxygen to the body. On the way, the oxygen concentration is diluted in the anatomical
dead volume. When it reaches the alveolus, ventilation may not be matched well enough to
perfusion to accomplish the necessary gas exchange. In the gas exchange process, gas must
diffuse through the alveolar space, across tissue, through plasma into the red blood cell, where
it finally chemically joins to hemoglobin. A similar process occurs for carbon dioxide
elimination. In this section, we deal with many of the details of gas movement.
As long as intermolecular interactions are small,16 most gases of physiological
significance can be considered to obey the ideal gas law:

pV = nRT

(4.2.4)

where p = pressure, N/m2
V = volume of gas, m3
n = number of moles, mol
R = gas constant, N·m/(mol· oK)
T = absolute temperature, oK
Errors involved in applying the ideal gas law are negligible up to atmospheric pressure
(101.3 kN/m2). Equation 4.2.4 may even be applied to vapors, although errors up to 5% may
be incurred with saturated vapors (Baumeister, 1967). The ideal gas law can be applied to a
mixture of gases, such as air, or to its constituents, such as oxygen and nitrogen. All individual
gases in a mixture are considered to fill the total volume and have the same temperature but
reduced pressures. The pressure exerted by each individual gas is called the partial pressure of
the gas and is denoted by a composition subscript on the pressure symbol p (see Section
3.2.1).
Dalton's law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the
constituents of a mixture:
N

p = ∑ pi
i =1

16

(4.2.5)

These interactions can be considered to be significant at temperatures close to the boiling point of the gas and at pressures
close to the pressure (at a particular temperature) at which the gas liquefies.

body temperature of 37oC, water vapor pressure is 6279 N/m2 (47 mm Hg). Since total
pressure18 is assumed to be 101.3 kN/m2, dry gas accounts for a pressure of 101.3 – 6.3 =
95.0 kN/m2.
Since temperature, pressure, and composition of respired gas change during breathing
and with position, it does not seem unusual that conventions were established to express gas
properties (especially compositions and partial pressures) uniformly. There are two of these:
(1) body temperature (37oC), standard pressure (101.3 kN/m2), saturated (pH2O =
6.28 kN/ m2), or BTPS, and (2) standard temperature (0oC), standard pressure (101.3 kN/m2),
dry (pH2O = 0), or STPD. Of the two, STPD is the more often used.
To calculate constituent partial pressures at STPD, total pressure is taken as barometric
pressure minus vapor pressure of water in the atmosphere:
pi = (Vi/V)(p - pH2O)

(4.2.11)

where p = total pressure, kN/m2
pH2O = vapor pressure of water in atmosphere, kN/m2
and Vi /V as a ratio does not change in the conversion process. (The process of water addition
to the air reduces partial pressures of the other constituents.

Constituent partial pressures vary throughout the respiratory system and circulatory
system. Table 4.2.7 shows some of this variation. Notice that nitrogen is considered to be
inert, and in the nitrogen components are included all other inert gases.
Alveolar gas composition remains fairly constant despite large changes in composition of
tracheal air (Figure 4.2.8). If this did not occur, there would be a large fluctuation in gaseous
composition of blood and a serious impact on tissues sensitive to changes in blood
composition (Morehouse and Miller, 1967). Partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen
nearly remain at 5.3 kN/m2 (40 mm Hg) and 13.3 kN/m2 (100 mm Hg) throughout inhalation
and exhalation. These values translate into the volume fractions listed in Table 4.2.8. During
exercise, the value of oxygen fraction in alveolar air decreases by nearly 2% and carbon
dioxide increases by nearly 2%.

Respiratory Exchange Ratio. Respiratory exchange ratio R is defined as the rate of carbon
dioxide expired ( VCO2 ) to oxygen used ( VDO2 ):

R = VCO2 / VDO2

(4.2.15)

In the steady state, the respiratory exchange ratio is equal to the respiratory quotient (RQ),
with RQ being defined as the rate of carbon dioxide produced divided by the rate of oxygen
utilized. The difference, then, between R and RQ is the difference between CO2 exhaled and
CO2 produced. These are different during extremely heavy exercise.
RQ is measured to obtain the caloric value of oxygen consumption (see Section 5.2.5)
and varies with the type of food being metabolized. For instance, carbohydrate contains
multiples of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the ratio of 1:2:1 and is metabolized in a
manner similar to glucose:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O

(4.2.16)

Six volumes of oxygen are used to produce 6 volumes of CO2. Thus the RQ of carbohydrate is
1.00.
Fats contain less oxygen than carbohydrates and therefore require more oxygen to
produce the same amount of carbon dioxide compared to carbohydrates. For instance,
tripalmitin is oxidized (Ganong, 1963) by
2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O

(4.2.17)

and, like other fats, has an RQ of 0.70.
Protein composition varies greatly, and so does protein RQ. However, an average RQ for
protein is 0.82. RQ has been measured for other important substances (Table 4.2.9).
Protein is not used as a fuel by working muscles when the supply of carbohydrate and fat
is adequate (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Nitrogen excretion in the urine, a by-product of
protein metabolism, does not rise significantly following muscular work.
For subjects on normal diets exercising aerobically, 50-60% of the energy required is
obtained from fats (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). In prolonged aerobic work, fat supplies up to
70% of the energy. Fats are very concentrated energy sources19 because they do not contain

Fat energy density is about 39.7 N·m/kg (9 kcal/g). Adipose tissue, which is not all fat, contains 25–29 N·m/kg (6–7 kcal/g).
Carbohydrate, on the other hand, has an energy density of 17.2 N·m/kg (4 kcal/g), and stored carbohydrate (glycogen) contains
about 4 N·m/kg (1 kcal/g) because of stored water of hydration (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).


184

much oxygen and energy is released by oxidizing both hydrogen and carbon in fat molecules
(unlike carbohydrates, which release energy, in effect, by carbon oxidation alone).
Carbohydrates are quick energy sources used predominantly at rest and at the beginning
of exercise (see Section 1.3.2). Blood glucose and muscle glycogen20 are the primary
carbohydrate sources.
Resting RQ and RQ at the beginning of exercise are normally about 0.8 (Morehouse and
Miller, 1967),21 indicating that about two-thirds of the required energy is obtained from fat and
one-third from carbohydrate. During strenuous exercise the RQ rises toward 1.00, indicating
that more of the energy is derived from carbohydrate. Hard work for a protracted time utilizes
more fat, and RQ approaches 0.7. Differing muscles and other organs probably exhibit
different RQs because of different metabolism states,22 and the overall RQ measured at the
mouth is the weighted sum of these.
Total RQ depends on the individual substances metabolized:
RQ = ∑XiRQi

(4.2.18)

where RQ = total RQ, dimensionless
Xi = fraction of substance i metabolized, dimensionless
RQi = RQ of substance i, dimensionless and
and
∑Xi = 1

(4.2.19)

Respiratory exchange ratio R differs from respiratory quotient RQ because less
information concerning fuel for metabolism can be inferred from R than from RQ During
secretion of gastric juice, for instance, the stomach has a negative respiratory exchange ratio
because it uses more CO2 from the arterial blood than it puts into the venous blood (Ganong,
1963). During anaerobic exercise, when there is not sufficient oxygen to completely
metabolize the metabolic substrates, lactic acid is formed and pours into the blood from the
working muscles. This excess acid drops the pH of the blood and shifts the balance of
Equation 3.2.3 toward a higher amount of CO2 available for respiratory exchange. Therefore,
there is a higher amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the lungs for the same amount of
oxygen used. Apparent R thus increases, many times exceeding 1.0.23 This value is not due to
the substances being oxidized: rather it is due to the manner in which they are being utilized
(see Section 1.3.5).
While the respiratory exchange ratio exceeds 1.0, products of metabolism are being
formed which will require oxygen to reform the original metabolites or to form carbon dioxide
and water (see Section 1.3.3). This required oxygen, called the oxygen debt (Figure 1.3.2), is
obtained at the cessation of exercise if the oxygen debt is large enough and widespread
throughout the muscles, or it can be obtained in other parts of the body if nonaerobic
metabolism is extremely localized.
At the cessation of heavy exercise, the repayment of the oxygen debt requires a large
amount of oxygen to be supplied while carbon dioxide stores in the body are being rebuilt.
During this time, R may drop as low as 0.50. Once the oxygen debt is repaid, the respiratory
exchange ratio returns eventually to resting levels and again becomes indicative of the type of
20
Glycogen is the stored form of glucose, which, unlike glucose, is notable to pass directly from the cell. Glycogen is formed
from glucose by phosphorylation and polymerization in a process called glycogenesis (Ganong, 1963).
21
Actually, this is nonprotein RQ, or RQ adjusted for metabolized protein. Since metabolized protein is usually much less than
fat or carbohydrate, and the amount of protein metabolized does not greatly change during work, nonprotein RQ is often
approximated by measured RQ.
22
For example, the RQ of the brain is regularly 0.97-0.99 (Ganong, 1963).
23
There have been efforts by many workers to correlate R > 1.0 with the onset of anaerobic metabolism. These correlations have
not always been successful, however, due to lack of agreement on a precise definition of the onset of anaerobic metabolism.


185

fuel being utilized.
The caloric equivalent of oxygen consumption is frequently needed for indirect
calorimetry. The caloric equivalent of oxygen is often taken to be 20.18 N·m/cm3
(4.82 kcal/L). However, the exact caloric equivalent depends on the fuel being burned and
cannot reliably be obtained whenever an oxygen debt is being incurred or repaid.
To determine more closely the caloric equivalent of oxygen consumption, a steady-state
measurement of RQ must be obtained. This RQ measurement can be converted into
nonprotein RQ by determining the urinary nitrogen excretion (Ganong, 1963). Each gram of
urinary nitrogen is equivalent to 6.25 g of protein. Metabolizing each gram of protein
consumes 940 cm3 O2 and produces 750 cm3 CO2 (Brown and Brengelmann, 1966). These
amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide are subtracted from measured totaIs24 and the results
can be divided to give nonprotein RQ. Assuming, then, that carbohydrate and fat are the only
other metabolized substances, it is possible to calculate the caloric equivalent of oxygen,
based on RQ:
XCHO = (RQ – 0.7)/0.3

(4.2.20)

where XCHO = carbohydrate fraction of metabolites, dimensionless
RQ = total, or overall respiration quotient, dimensionless
Since each 1000 cm3 of oxygen consumed corresponds to 1.23 g carbohydrate and 0.50 g
fat (Ganong, 1963), and the caloric equivalent of carbohydrate has been given as 17.2 N·m/kg
and that of fat is 39.7 N·m/kg, then

Lung Diffusion. Movement of gases occurs by two basic mechanisms in the respiratory
system: (1) convection transport, or bulk flow of gas, which we have seen predominates to
the fifteenth airway generation and (2) diffusion, which predominates thereafter. Diffusion of
gases occurs by the well-known Fick’s second equation (Geankoplis, 1978):

Emmert and Pigford (1963) estimate the accuracy of this method of calculation of gas diffusion
constants to average within 4% of the true values with a maximum deviation of 16%.

Normally, one would be mainly interested in the diffusion constants of various gases
through air, and these are probably the proper values of diffusion constants to use in the upper
respiratory system. In the alveoli, however, gas composition, as we have seen (Table 4.2.7), is
dissimilar from ambient air. Modified diffusion constants can be calculated from Equation
4.2.26, or a somewhat simpler method proposed by Fuller et al. (1966) can be used.
The approach used by Fuller et al. (1966) begins with the Stefan–Maxwell molecular
hard sphere model and additive LeBas atomic volumes. With the form of the equations thus
established, they used a nonlinear least squares analysis to empirically determine coefficient
values from diffusion coefficients obtained from the literature. Their equation is

diffusion coefficients are expected to be slightly greater using Equation 4.2.29 compared to
Equation 4.2.26.

Diffusion which occurs within a binary system of gases with equimolar counterdiffusion

results in

Diffusion within ambient air is usually managed by considering air to be a uniform and
constant medium, a binary constituent. Alveolar air is not constant or uniform, and it cannot
be considered to be binary. For multicomponent diffusion, Emmert and Pigford (1963) give
Di =

1− X i
N

(4.2.32)

∑ ( X j / Di j )
j =1

where Di = diffusion coefficient of constituent i in the multicomponent system, m2/sec
Xi = mole fraction of constituent i, dimensionless
Gas diffusion coefficients should be calculated for binary diffusion using Equation 4.2.29
and converted to multicomponent diffusion coefficients for alveolar air using Equation 4.2.32.
Values of alveolar gas diffusivities calculated in this way appear in Table 4.2.14 and it can be
seen that alveolar gas diffusivity values differ from ambient gas diffusivity values by about
15%.
During exercise, and at other times when the respiratory exchange ratio differs
significantly from 1.0, the alveolar gas can no longer be considered to be a stagnant medium.
There results a net movement of mass with a mean velocity VDm . This case is not strictly
diffusion in that a convective flow is also present.
Gas Mixing in the Airways. In any thorough consideration of gas delivery to the lungs,
account must be made for the effects of combined convection (bulk movement) and diffusion
(molecular movement) within the conducting airways. Although this subject can be very
involved because of the complicated geometry of the air passages, it is nonetheless especially
important in high-frequency ventilation.26 There may also be an effect of non–steady-state gas
mixing at the very high respiration rates achieved during heavy exercise.
26
It has been found clinically that normal blood gas compositions can be maintained inpatients with respiratory obstruction by
assisted ventilation at high frequency (typically 5–15 cps) and low tidal volume (typically one-third of normal dead volume).


190

This subject has been very thoroughly presented by Pedley et al. (1977) and by Ultman
(1981), and it will not be completely developed here. A few pertinent details will, however, be
presented.
Flow in the conducting airways removes excess carbon dioxide during exhalation and
supplies fresh oxygen during inhalation. In each case, there is a divergence between the gas
composition of the flowing gas and that of the gas which is being displaced. Gas movement
by convection is present for sure. Likewise, the difference in gas concentration between the
displacing gas and the contacting displaced gas provides the opportunity for molecular
diffusion.
Mathematical specification of axial gas transport in a conduit is given (Ultman, 1981) by
dF
VDi = FiVD − ( Dij + Di j ) A i
(4.2.33)
dx
where VDi = volume rate of flow of constituent i, m3/sec
VD = volume rate of flow of entire plug of gas, m3/sec
Dij = diffusion coefficient, m2/sec
Di j = longitudinal dispersion coefficient, m2/sec
Fi = average volume fraction of constituent i, m3/ m3
A = total cross-sectional area of tube, m2
x = distance along tube, m
The ratio of material delivery by axial convection to that by radial diffusion is known as
the Péclet number (Pe). The rate of supply by convective flow is given by
VD = vAci

(4.2.34)

where VD = volume rate of flow, m3/sec
v = average flow velocity, m/sec
A = cross-sectional area, m2
ci = concentration, kg/kg
Steady-state material diffusion is given by
dc
c
VD = Di j A i = Di j A i
dx
l
where (c/l) = mean concentration gradient, m–1
The Péclet number is thus given by

(4.2.35)

(4.2.36)

Pe = lv/Dij

Péclet numbers within the respiratory system vary from 10,000 at the mouth to 0.01 at the
alveolar ducts.
In laminar flow through a straight tube, the profile of velocities of gas particles flowing
along the tube will appear to be parabolic (see Section 4.2.3). That is, the velocity of particles
in the center of the tube will be twice the average velocity and the velocity at the wall will be
zero. Thus molecules of a gas in higher concentration in the displacing gas mixture will travel
downstream faster in the center of the tube than at the wall. Consequently, the resulting
concentration difference between tube midline and tube wall enhances radial diffusion of this
constituent gas (Ben Jebria, 1984). Taylor (1953) showed that this mechanism can be
described as longitudinal dispersion27 with an equivalent virtual diffusion coefficient:
Dij = Di j +
27

(vd ) 2
192 Di j

This mechanism of enhanced diffusion by laminar convective transport is called Taylor dispersion.

(4.2.37)


191

where v = mean axial velocity, m/sec
d = tube diameter, m
The value for the number in the denominator, here shown as 192, varies with velocity profile
(Ultman, 1981). For even moderate velocities and diameters, Dij >>Dij28 And, interestingly,
the lower the molecular diffusivity Dij of any gas, the higher will be the dispersion coefficient
Dij.
In turbulent flow, the velocity profile is much flatter. The equivalent dispersion
coefficient is smaller (Ben Jebria, 1984):

Dij = Dij + 0.73vd

(4.2.38)

With this cursory discussion, gas mixing in the airways due to simultaneous convection and
diffusion can begin to be understood.
Diffusion Capacity. As if alveolar diffusion alone were not complicated enough, there is
diffusion across the alveolar membrane into the capillary plasma, diffusion through the
plasma, diffusion into the red blood cell, and chemical binding of both oxygen and carbon
dioxide to account for. Furthermore, nonnormal lungs29 may not have a uniform distribution of
inspired gas, thus having a nonuniform alveolar gas concentration (Sackner, 1976d). For these
reasons it is often convenient to consider only the overall diffusing capacity of the lung.
Certainly, it is much easier to make this measurement than to measure individual alveoli
diffusion parameters.
Lung diffusing capacity30 is defined (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970) as

DL =

gas flow
mean driving pressure

(4.2.39)

where DL = lung diffusing capacity, m5/(N·sec)
Mean driving pressure is the difference between average alveolar pressure and mean capillary
partial pressure.
Lung diffusing capacity for oxygen is of primary interest. However, mean capillary
oxygen partial pressure is difficult to ascertain. It would be better to choose a gas which is
held by the pulmonary capillaries at a constant partial pressure, or which disappears entirely.
Carbon monoxide has 210 times the affinity for hemoglobin as does oxygen (Sackner, 1976d)
and, for all purposes, is completely removed from the plasma by circulating red blood cells.
Carbon monoxide, in low concentration, has thus become the standard challenge gas for
determination of lung diffusing capacity:

DLCO = VDCO / p A CO

(4.2.40)

where DLCO = lung diffusing capacity for CO, m5/(N·sec)
V
= CO rate of absorption in the lung, m3/sec
CO

pACO = mean alveolar partial pressure for CO, N/m2
Steady-state lung diffusion capacity for oxygen is obtained from steady-state lung diffusion
capacity for carbon monoxide by multiplying the latter by 1.23 (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
For (d/l)(Pe) > 180, the Dij < 0.05Dij, and for (d/l)(Pe) < 20, the Dij < 0.05Dij where 1=tube length, m (Ultman, 1981).
These lungs are characterized by compartments with unequal time constants (flow resistance multiplied by compliance).
Regions with small time constant fill faster and empty faster. Compartments can have long time constants (usually caused by
high resistance) for one phase of breathing and short time constants for the other. For example, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and emphysema have particularly long time constants for emptying and are called obstructive pulmonary
diseases; asthma, which is a restrictive pulmonary disease, is characterized by long filling and emptying time constants.
30
Diffusing capacity is analogous to electrical conductance. For this reason, some authors call it "transfer factor," or "transfer
coefficient."
28

192

Diffusion capacity values obtained at rest are not the same as diffusion capacity values
obtained during exercise. Diffusion capacity is influenced by alveolar surface area (70–90 m2),
thickness of the membrane separating air from blood, and pulmonary capillary blood volume,
or hemoglobin content (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Figure 4.2.9 shows the large increase
(three times) in diffusion capacity which occurs during exercise. Most of the increase is
attributable to an increase in the number of capillaries open during work (Astrand and Rodahl,
1970). For a similar reason, diffusion rates for women are lower than those for men because
alveolar surface area varies with body weight (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
Figure 4.2.5 illustrates the diffusion pathway taken by oxygen from the alveolar space to
the interior of the red blood cell. Oxygen must diffuse across the alveolar capillary
membranes and into the plasma, across the red cell membrane and through the red cell
interior, finally to be bound to hemoglobin. Hill et al. (1977) used the kinetics of the reactions
of oxygen and carbon dioxide at various stages in this process to formulate a model of oxygen
and carbon dioxide exchanges during exercise.
Carbon dioxide diffusion rates are about 20 times those for oxygen (Astrand and Rodahl,
1970). Contributing to this ratio is the fact that CO2 molecules are larger than O2 molecules,
thus slowing diffusion, but CO2 diffuses about 25 times more rapidly than O2 in aqueous
liquids (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Reaction rates of Equation 3.2.3, the equilibrium reaction
between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide in the blood, are so slow, however, that all the CO2
which must be removed from the blood would not be available to diffuse into the lungs if it
were not for carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the reaction and allows it to proceed much
more rapidly. Without carbonic anhydrase, the blood would have to remain in the capillaries
for almost 4 min for the CO2 to be given off (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
Diffusion capacity for carbon dioxide has been found to be an insensitive predictor of
abnormal gas exchange during exercise (Sue et al., 1987). Therefore, other measures, such as
arterial blood gases, must be used to determine exercise gas exchange.
Blood Gases. As the physiological interface between air and blood, the respiratory system must
be studied from both aspects. We have already dealt with blood gas partial pressure in this

Figure 4.2.9 Variation in diffusing capacity for oxygen with increasing oxygen uptake during work on a
bicycle ergometer in the sitting position for 10 trained women (bottom curve) and 10 trained men (upper
curve). Increasing values on the abscissa can be considered to be increasing work rates. (Adapted and

chapter, as well as with blood gas dynamics in Chapter 3. Some details must still be
introduced to complete the necessary background for study of respiratory contribution to
blood gas exchange.
Carbon dioxide and oxygen are the most important gases for consideration. Other gases,
such as nitrogen, do not normally play a large role in respiratory gas exchange.31 In a general
sense, blood gas levels leaving the lung remain reasonably constant: blood pCO2 is 5333 N/m2
(40 mm Hg) and blood pO2 is 13.3 kN/m2 (100 mm Hg). Carbon dioxide partial pressure in
mixed (pulmonary) venous blood and alveolar air is highly variable, but it begins at about
2000 N/m2 at rest, decreases to about 1500 N/m2 during light exercise, and increases again in
severe exercise (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
The relationships between alveolar partial pressures and respiratory blood partial
pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are seen in Figure 4.2.10. Carbon dioxide partial
pressure in the blood closely tracks carbon dioxide partial pressure in the alveolar space, and,
for many practical purposes, can be considered to be the same.
There is a slight variation in arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen
throughout the breathing cycle. Respiratory-related variations of about 900 N/m2 (7 mm Hg)
in pO2 have been found in anesthetized dogs, lambs, and cats (Biscoe and Willshaw, 1981).
For resting dogs, alveolar variation of pO2, has been calculated to be 1300 N/m2 (10 mm Hg)
and for resting humans it has been calculated as 400 N/m2 (3 mm Hg).
A variation in arterial pCO2 has been measured indirectly32 as 270 N/m2 (2 mm Hg) in
anesthetized cats (Biscoe and Willshaw, 1981). Alveolar pCO2 changes by about 270 N/m2
(2 mm Hg) in resting man, but exercise is expected to increase the excursion.
The extent of variation depends greatly on mixing occurring in the heart. The higher the
number of heartbeats per breath, the less mixing occurs and the greater is the partial pressure
variation. Similarly, greater end-systolic volumes attenuate the variation more than lesser
volumes (Biscoe and Willshaw, 1981).
Two factors contribute to the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen partial
pressures. The first of these is shunting of venous blood around the effective alveolar volume
31

Nitrogen exchange, as well as other so-called inert gas exchange, is important in pulmonary function measurement and
abnormal respiratory or metabolic conditions.
A mean variation of 0.15 pH units was recorded.

to be mixed consequently with arterial blood from the effective alveolar volume. Although
this has a large effect on oxygen partial pressure of the resulting blood mixture, it has but a
small effect on carbon dioxide partial pressure because the CO2 dissociation curve for blood is
very steep (Figure 4.2.11), indicating a small partial pressure change per unit change in
concentration (also see Figure 3.2.4). The second factor contributing to oxygen partial
pressure difference between alveoli and blood is the diffusion rate of oxygen across the
alveolar membrane, which is much slower for oxygen than for carbon dioxide.
More importantly, oxygen saturation of mixed (pulmonary) venous blood is nearly 100%
during rest and exercise up to that requiring oxygen uptake of 67 x 10-6 m3/sec: (4 L/min)
(Morehouse and Miller, 1967). This comes about because pulmonary vessels closed during
rest open during exercise, with the effect that the volume of blood through the lungs increases
without a corresponding increase of velocity of blood through the lungs. Blood transit time
through the lungs therefore remains nearly constant. The resulting improvement in distribution
of ventilation to perfusion results in a decrease in oxygen partial pressure difference across the
capillary and alveolar membranes. During very heavy exercise, the increased acidity and
temperature of the blood (see Figures 3.2.2 and 3.2.3) reduce the ability of hemoglobin to
absorb oxygen, resulting in lower blood saturation (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
The amount of oxygen in the blood (which comes, originally, from respiration) can be
obtained from (see Section 3.2.1)

c O 2 = 1340 S c H + 0.023 x 10 -5 pO 2
where c O2

(4.2.41)

= oxygen concentration of the blood, m3 O2/m3 blood

S = hemoglobin saturation, fractional
cH = hemoglobin concentration, kg hemoglobin/m3 blood

concentrations of carbon dioxide is accompanied by a very small change in carbon dioxide partial
pressure. (Adapted and used with permission from Riley, 1965.)


195

The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 4.2.41 reflects the concentration of oxygen
carried by hemoglobin, and the second term represents dissolved oxygen (see Section 3.2.1).
Average men have about 160 kg hemoglobin per cubic meter of blood (Ganong, 1963), and
hemoglobin saturation can be calculated from Equations 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 or from a similar
procedure given by West and Wagner (1977). The amount of oxygen absorbed by the
pulmonary blood is

VDO 2 = ( ∆c O 2 ) (CO)
where VDO 2 =

West and Wagner (1977) presented a procedure to calculate the amount of carbon dioxide
taking part in respiration. They began with a procedure similar in theory to Equation 4.2.41:
total blood CO2 = plasma CO2 + red blood cell CO2

(4.2.43)

Based on the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (see Equation 3.2.4) plasma CO2 or dissolved
CO2 is calculated from
plasma CO2 = α

CO 2

West and Wagner (1977) gave expressions for these as functions of temperature and pH:
pK = 6.086 + 0.042(7.4 – pH) + (38 – θ)[0.0047 + 0.0014(7.4 – pH)]

(4.2.45)

where θ = temperature, oC
and

α CO = 0.230 + 0.0043(37 – θ) + 0.0002(37 - θ)2

(4.2.46)

Since the fractions of red blood cells and plasma in the blood are related by hematocrit,
carbon dioxide concentration is

c CO2 = 222[(Ht)(red cell CO2) + (1 – Ht)(plasma CO2)]

(4.2.47)

where c CO2 = total CO2 concentration in the blood, m3 CO2/m3 blood
Ht = hematocrit, fractional
West and Wagner (1977) calculated red blood cellular carbon dioxide as proportional to
plasma carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. Thus total CO2 concentration
becomes

c CO2 = (plasma CO2) [222][(Ht)(B – 1) + 1]

(4.2.48)

and

B = B1 + (B2 – B1)(1 – S)

(4.2.49a)


196

B1 = 0.590 + 0.2913(7.4 – pH) – 0.08447(7.4 – pH)2

(4.2.49b)

B2 = 0.644 + 0.227(7.4 – pH) – 0.0938(7.4 – pH)2

(4.2.49c)

where S = fractional hemoglobin saturation, dimensionless
Fractional hematocrit is usually about 0.47 for mean and about 0.42 for women and children
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
Similar to oxygen, the amount of carbon dioxide taking part in respiratory exchange is

VDCO 2 = ( ∆cCO2 )(CO)

(4.2.50)

where VDCO 2 = carbon dioxide evolution, m3/sec
∆cCO2 = change in carbon dioxide concentration between pulmonary
arterial and pulmonary venous blood, m3 CO2/m3
CO = cardiac output, m3/sec
Pulmonary Gas Exchange. The problem of pulmonary gas exchange is that experimental
procedures limit the sites where data may be obtained. As we have seen, complex mechanisms
and adjustments in the respiratory system are quite normal, but usual respiratory gas
measurements can be made only at the mouth and sometimes in the systemic circulation.
From these measurements must be inferred information concerning metabolic state, alveolar
efficacy, pulmonary perfusion, respiratory dead volume, and a host of other interesting and
clinically important processes possessed by the individual from whom the data were obtained.
Fortunately, there are mathematical means to deduce much useful pulmonary gas
exchange information. The ideas in this section are relatively simple, and the algebra is not
overwhelming. The problem, however, is in nomenclature; with so many subscripts and
superscripts it is easy to become confused. It is hoped that the clear and straightforward
presentation here will prevent that. Symbols generally follow those used by Riley (1965).
We begin with a simple steady-state mass balance, first on oxygen:
O2 used = O2 intake – O2 exhausted

VDO 2 = VDi FiO2 − VDe Fe O2

(4.2.51)

(4.2.52)

where VDO 2 = oxygen uptake, m /sec
VDi = inhaled flow rate, m3/sec
VDe = exhaled flow rate, m3/sec
Fi O 2 = fractional concentration33 of oxygen in inhaled gas, m3/m3
FeO2 = fractional concentration of oxygen in exhaled dry gas, m3/m3
And next on carbon dioxide
3

VDCO 2 = VDe FeCO2 − VDi Fi CO2

(4.2.53)

where VDCO 2 = carbon dioxide efflux, m3/sec
FeCO2 = fractional concentration of carbon dioxide in exhaled dry gas, m3/ m3
FiCO2 = fractional concentration of carbon dioxide in inhaled dry gas, m3/m3
FiCO2 is usually assumed to be zero for atmospheric air breathing. There are cases, especially
those where masks are worn, where FiCO2 cannot be assumed to be zero (Johnson, 1976).
Notice, also, that all gases are assumed to be at STPD conditions (see Equation 4.2.14).
33

Fractional concentration is given as volume of gas A per unit volume of mixture of gases A and B. From Equation 4.2.9 we
could have given fractional concentration in terms of partial pressures.


197

Since there is a difference between inspired and expired volumes, a mass balance on
nitrogen, which is assumed to have no net exchange across the lungs, is performed to account
for volume differences:

VN 2 = Vi FiN 2 − Ve FeN 2

(4.2.54)

Vi = Ve ( Fe N 2 / Fi N 2 )

(4.2.55)

where VN 2 = nitrogen uptake, m3/sec
Fe N 2 = fractional concentration of nitrogen in exhaled dry gas, m3/m3
Fi N 2 = fractional concentration of nitrogen in inhaled dry gas, m3/m3
Many relationships have been developed between these variables to aid pulmonary
function testing. Since measurement technique is not the object of this book, most of these
relationships are ignored here. The reader is referred to Riley (1965) for further details. One
useful relationship is considered, however: the determination of respiratory dead volume VD.
During a single expiration the first air to leave the mouth is from the respiratory dead
volume-the air closest to the mouth. This air has not exchanged gases with the blood and is
virtually the same composition as inspired air (with the addition of water vapor, of course).
Air that reaches the mouth after the dead volume air has been exhaled is considered to be from
the alveolar space (see Figure 4.2.12). It is this air which is in equilibrium with the blood.
Because carbon dioxide is continually evolving, the CO2 content of alveolar air continually
increases (Turney, 1983) with the rate of increase related to rate of CO2 evolution (Newstead
et al., 1980). Normally, pulmonary technicians have considered the so-called end-tidal CO2
concentration to be representative of alveolar air. Because of the increasing CO2
concentration, end-tidal air may not be as meaningful as previously supposed.
Considering the expired air to be composed of dead volume air and alveolar air:

Ve = VAe + VDe

(4.2.56)

Figure 4.2.12 A typical tracing of carbon dioxide concentration with time during an exhaled breath. The
first air to be removed is dead volume air and the last is alveolar air. Carbon dioxide concentration of
alveolar air increases with time because carbon dioxide from the blood is constantly being delivered to
the alveoli.

where Ve = exhaled volume, m3

VAe = exhaled volume from alveolar space, m3

is usually taken to be the maximum CO2

concentration during the exhalation, and FeCO 2 is the CO2 concentration of the well-mixed
total exhaled breath.
Pulmonary gas relationships will be developed for three effective pulmonary
compartments (Riley, 1966): (1) effective, (2) ventilated but unperfused, and (3) perfused but
unventilated. The effective compartment is considered to be the part of the lung where gas
exchange occurs between alveoli and capillaries. Its volume is the alveolar volume VA. Both
second and third compartments are ineffective for gas exchange and comprise the respiratory
dead volume. Compartment two corresponds to the anatomic dead volume and compartment
three represents the alveolar dead volume.
Three similar compartments can be considered from the blood side of the alveolar
membranes. In the respiratory circulation, however, we do not talk of blood dead volume, but
rather of blood shunting. The effect of blood shunting is to mix unaerated mixed venous blood
with aerated arterial blood.
A carbon dioxide balance of the effective volume, or alveolar volume, gives

VCO 2 = VAe FAeCO 2 − VAi FAiCO2

(4.2.60)

where VAe = alveolar ventilation rate during exhalation, m3/sec
VAi = alveolar ventilation rate during inhalation, m3/sec
If FAiCO2 = 0, then

V p CO 2
VCO 2 = Ae A
( p B − pH 2 O )

(4.2.61)

where pACO2 = mean CO2 partial pressure of effective alveolar space, N/m2
pB = total barometric pressure = 101 kN/m2
pH2O = partial pressure of water vapor at the temperature of the respiratory system
= 6280 N/m2
and, as discussed previously, alveolar and arterial CO2 partial pressures can be considered to
be the same values:
pACO2 = paCO2
(4.2.62)
where paCO2 = arterial CO2 partial pressure, N/m2


199

The dead space compartments contribute no carbon dioxide to the exhaled air.34 The dead
volume compartments therefore effectively increase the volume of the exhaled breath and
dilute the carbon dioxide concentration from that of the effective compartment. This condition
has already been considered in the formulation of the Bohr equation (4.2.59).
A carbon dioxide balance in the blood yields
QD eff =

VDCO 2

(4.2.63)

C vCO 2 c eff CO 2

where QD eff = rate of blood flow through the effective compartment, m3/sec
c vCO 2 = mixed venous (systemic) concentration of carbon dioxide, m3 CO2/m3 blood
c effCO2 = carbon dioxide concentration of effective blood compartment, m3CO2/m3 blood
The effective blood perfusion rate QC eff is related to total blood flow Q pulm by the addition
of the shunt component of blood QC s . The concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood
returning to the tissues therefore contains contributions from shunt (mixed venous pCO2) and
effective (arterial c CO 2 ) blood flows:

c CO 2 =

(Q pulm − Q eff )cvCO + Q eff caCO
2

(4.2.64)

where c aCO 2 = concentration of carbon dioxide in systemic arterial blood, m3 CO2/m3 blood
Oxygen balances on alveolar and blood components give equations so similar to

Figure 4.2.13 Oxygen content of mixed venous blood at rest and during work up to maximum on a
bicycle ergometer. During maximal work the arterial saturation is about 92% compared with 97–98% at
rest; the venous oxygen content is very low and similar for women and men. (Adapted and used with
permission from Astrand and Rodahl, 1970.)
34

This is not exactly true, since carbon dioxide accumulates in the anatomic dead space during the previous exhalation and is
subsequently inhaled into the remaining portions of the dead volume compartment. This small amount of carbon dioxide
contributes to the carbon dioxide concentration of the following exhalation.

Equations 4.2.57–4.2.64 that they are not repeated here. An oxygen balance on the overall
respiratory system gives

VDO 2 = ( VDA + VD / T) FiO 2 – ( VDA + VD /T) FeO 2

(4.2.65)

where VDO 2 = oxygen uptake, m /sec
VDA = alveolar ventilation rate, m3/sec
VD = total dead volume, m
T = respiratory period, sec
FiO 2 = fractional concentration of oxygen in inhaled air, m3O2 /m3 air
FeO 2 = fractional concentration of oxygen in exhaled air, m3O2 /m3 air
For modeling purposes, it is usually necessary to know the return concentrations of mixed
venous blood and calculate the respiratory system loading to refresh the blood (Figure 4.2.13).
Partial pressure of arterial O2 does not change greatly during exercise; arterial O2 saturation is
about 92% during exercise compared to 97–98% at rest (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).

4.2.3 Mechanical Properties
Mechanical properties of the respiratory system play an important role in its operation. The
mechanical properties normally considered are resistance, compliance, and inertance, which
combine with flow rate, volume, and volume acceleration to produce pressure. The relative
values of these pressures determine respiratory response to exercise in a way to be described
later.
Respiratory System Models. A lumped-parameter,35 greatly simplified analog model of
the respiratory system appears in Figure 4.2.14. Three components of airways, lung tissue, and
chest wall are shown.36 Each of these components has elements of resistance (diagramed as an
electrical resistor), compliance (electrical capacitor), and inertance (electrical inductor).
Between components exist pressures denoted as alveolar and pleural pressures. Muscle
pressure is the driving force for airflow to occur.
A pressure balance on the model of Figure 4.2.14 gives
(pm – patm) + (palv – pm) + (ppl – palv) + (pmus – ppl) + (patm – pmus) = 0

(4.2.66)

pm = mouth pressure, N/m2
patm = atmospheric pressure, N/m2
palv = alveolar pressure, N/m2
ppl = pleural pressure, N/m2
pmus = muscle pressure, N/m2
Each pressure difference37 can be expressed as

where

∆p = R V + V/C + V I
35

(4.2.67)

A lumped-parameter respiratory model considers similar properties collected in a small number of elements. Although these
properties are really distributed throughout the respiratory system, their lumped-parameter depiction can assist understanding.
Many different lumped-parameter respiratory system models have appeared in the literature. The reason for this is that
different measurement methods and different model uses make other models more appropriate. Models can only approximate
the true nature of the respiratory system, and the selection of an appropriate model is often based on reproduction by the model
of certain kinds of data at the expense of other kinds of data. Recent respiratory modeling work has attempted to describe
frequency dependencies of respiratory resistances and compliances (Dorkin et al., 1988).

The model of Figure 4.2.14 is actually too complicated for some purposes. The model
seen in Figure 4.2.15 is much more useful when simple pulmonary function measurements are
made or complicated mathematical expressions are used. When comparing the models in
Figures 4.2.14 and 4.2.15, and noting the simplicity of the latter, one might wonder why the
first model is considered at all. It is for these reasons:
1. The model of Figure 4.2.14 is more realistic than the model of Figure 4.2.15.
2. Certain respiratory disorders are localized to one of the three components in Figure
4.2.14, and specific information about that component is required.
3. Values of the elements in Figure 4.2.14 are more constant than those in Figure 4.2.15,
which show strong changes with frequency of respiration.

Table 4.2.15 gives typical values of mechanical elements appearing in the model of
Figure 4.2.14. To obtain values for resistance R and compliance C appearing in Figure 4.2.15
use standard methods of combining electrical elements:

R = Raw + Rlt + Rcw

(4.2.68)

C lt C cw
C lt + C cw

(4.2.69)

C≅

This latter approximation is valid because airway compliance is nearly zero.38
Diurnal variation of 4–12% in lung volumes and mechanical parameters during exercise
should be accounted for (Garrard and Emmons, 1986). Experimental results have shown
significant diurnal variation in minute volume, respiratory exchange ratio, and carbon dioxide
production rate.
Drugs, too, can significantly affect mechanical parameter values. A series of
bronchoreactive drugs has been developed for use by asthmatics and others to reduce airway
resistance. Even as common a drug as aspirin has been found to increase nasal resistance
significantly (Jones et al., 1985), and airborne contaminants normally present in the
atmosphere can have significant respiratory effects (Love, 1983).
38
Airway compliance can be considered to be the compliance of the enclosed air. (Some investigators consider airway
compliance to be the compliance of the tissue of the lung, the parenchyma.) Since C = V/p and, from Equation 4.2.4, p = nRT/R,
then Caw = V2/nRT If we consider the entire lung volume to be gas entrapped within the airways, then FRC =2.4 x 10-3m3 (Table
4.2.3), T = 310o K, and R ≅ 286.7 N·mg/(kg mol oK) (Table 4.2.5). Since there are 22.4 L/kg mol at STP, there are 0.107 mol
of air in the lung at FRC. Therefore, Caw ≅ 6 x 10-10 m5/N.


203

Resistance. Resistance is the energy dissipative element that appears in the respiratory
system. That is, unlike compliance and inertance elements, which store energy for future use,
resistance pressure losses are not recoverable.39 Most of the energy that is developed to cause
air to flow through the resistance eventually becomes heat.
Resistance in the respiratory system appears in several places: in the airways, in the lung
tissue, and in the chest wall. Airway resistance occurs due to the movement of air through the
conducting air passages; lung tissue and chest wall resistances appear due to viscous
dissipation of energy when tissues slide past, or move relative to, one another.
These resistances are not constant (Macklem, 1980). They vary with flow rate and lung
volume. One of the first attempts to quantify flow rate dependence was given by Rohrer
(1915). Rohrer reasoned that pressure reduction in the airways should be due to laminar flow
effects and turbulent effects (see Section 3.2.2). To account for these he postulated

p = K1 VD + K2 VD 2

(4.2.70)

Kl = first Rohrer coefficient, N·sec/m5
K2 = second Rohrer coefficient, N·sec2/m8
VD = flow rate, m3/sec
From this,
where

R = P/ VD = K1 + K2 VD

(4.2.71)

With lung volume remaining constant, resistance, as given by Equation 4.2.71, does appear to
be described well in many individuals. In others, however, it appears that higher powers of VD
are required (Mead, 1961). This indicates that Rohrer's original concept of laminar and
turbulent flows may not be entirely correct (Mead, 1961).
An alternative method of describing pressure loss was given by Ainsworth and Eveleigh
(1952):

P = K VD n

(4.2.72)

where K = coefficient, N·secn/m(2 + n)
n = exponent, dimensionless
which plots as a straight line on log-log paper. Unfortunately, this description does not appear
to be any more accurate than Rohrer's equation, and it has not been used as frequently.
Rohrer's equation has been applied to tissue as well as airway resistance. In applying it to
tissue resistances, airflow rate is still used to obtain pressure difference despite the fact that air
does not flow through the lung tissue and chest wall. Values for Rohrer's coefficients for
various segments are given in Table 4.2.16. There is great variation in Rohrer's coefficients
for different individuals,40 and exhalation coefficients are generally higher than inhalation
coefficients.
Standard terminology has the term respiratory resistance applied to airway plus lung
tissue plus chest wall resistance. Pulmonary resistance is the term used for airway plus lung
tissue resistance (respiratory resistance excluding chest wall resistance).
Most pressure-flow nonlinearities are found in the mouth and upper airways (Figure
4.2.16). Higher airflow rates occur in those segments compared to those in the lower airways,
and therefore turbulence and nonlinearity are more likely to be found in the upper flow
39
Energy stored in compliance and inertance elements is not necessarily always recovered either, if it causes the respiratory
muscles to oppose the recovery. If negative work (see Section 5.2.5) is required, there may even be a greater energy expenditure
because of the stored energy compared to resistive dissipation.
40
Mead and Whittenberger (1953) give a range of 98–243 (mean 171 kN·sec/m5) in K1 and a range of 12–48 (mean 28 mN
sec2/m8) in K2 values for seven subjects.

segments (Table 4.2.17). Lower airway, lung tissue, and chest wall resistances are, for all
practical purposes, constant (linear pressure-flow characteristic).
Steady laminar or turbulent flow profiles are established only at some distance from the
inlet of a pipe. As the result of bifurcation, the previously established velocity profile is split
by the wall at the branch point, and the new velocity profiles in each of the downstream
segments are asymmetric for a while (Figure 4.2.17). The entrance length for laminar flow can

Entrance length for turbulent flow is one-third to one-half that for laminar flow (Jacquez,
1979).
Within the entrance length, there is a great deal of turbulence and eddying, even for
Reynolds numbers predicting laminar flow. Thus there is a larger amount of pressure lost than
would be the case after a fully developed velocity profile is reached, and effective resistance
within the entrance length is higher than would normally be expected.
For the airway segments listed in Table 4.2.17, all but the very smallest have lengths
which are shorter than their calculated entrance lengths based their diameters and Reynolds
numbers.41 This would indicate that some amount of turbulence exists in most segments below
Reynolds numbers of 2000.
Chang and El Masry (1982) and Isabey and Chang (1982) used a scale model of the
human central airways to measure velocity profiles in the airways. They found a high degree
of asymmetry in all branches, with peak velocities near the inner walls of the bifurcation.
Velocity profiles were more sensitive to airway geometry, including curvature, than to flow
rate. Slutsky et al. (1980) obtained measurements of friction coefficients between trachea and
fourth- or fifth-generation airways on a cast model of human central airways. They found a
traditional Moody diagram (Figure 4.2.18) relation between friction coefficient and Reynolds
number at the trachea.

500, laminar flow exists. Fully developed turbulence exists at Reynolds numbers greater than 5000. In
between is transitional flow. (Used with permission from Slutsky et al., 1980.)

It is not until the fourteenth generation that entrance length becomes less than actual length, when total airflow is 0.001 m3/sec
(1 L/sec) (Jacquez, 1979).

Based on this, however, laminar flow was found to exist only to Reynolds numbers of 500–700,
with the transition to turbulent flow occurring at Reynolds numbers higher than 700. Fully
developed turbulent flow was found at Reynolds numbers greater than 10,000. This experimental
evidence is important in that pressure drop in the upper airways has been shown to act as if laminar
flow exists below Reynolds numbers of 700 despite the fact that entrance length of these airways is
longer than the airways themselves.42

Airway resistance is usually measured at a flow rate of 0.001 m3/sec (1 L/sec). Table
4.2.18 gives the approximate percentage of total resistance found in each segment for mouth
breathing at 0.001 m3/sec flow rate. At higher flow rates, as found during exercise, the
segments with nonlinear pressure–flow characteristics would be expected to contribute a
much higher proportion of the total resistance.43 Table 4.2.19 gives similar proportions for
quiet nose breathing.
42
Slutsky et al. (1980) also showed that air distribution to upper lung segments is reduced compared to lower lung segments
because of the more acute angles of airway branching in the upper airways. Because of this, pressure loss in the upper segment
airways is greater for a given flow rate than it is for the lower segment airways. To account for experimental evidence of more
even distribution of lung ventilation than would be expected from airways pressure loss, others have argued for reduced
pressure loss in peripheral airways of the upper and for a higher applied pleural pressure at the upper lung than at the lower
lung.
43
Total respiratory resistance, which is about 400 N·sec/m5 during quiet breathing, increases to 1400 N·sec/m5 during rapid
inspiration and to 2000–2400+ N·sec/m5 during rapid expiration (Mead, 1961).


208

During quiet nose breathing it has been shown that nasal resistance accounts for a large
part of total airway resistance. The transition from nasal to mouth breathing during exercise
seems to occur with little or no change in resistance, mouth breathing resistance at 1.67 x 10-3
m3/sec (100 L/min) flow rate being nearly equal to nasal breathing resistance at rest. Cole et
al. (1982) showed in five subjects that oral resistance was much higher when subjects were
allowed to open their mouths to a natural degree than when mouthpieces required them to
hold their mouths wide open. Average natural resistance decreased with increasing flow rate
(R = 2.01 x 105 - 1.76 x 105 V ), and resistance reductions of 70–88% were found when
mouthpieces were used.
Values of resistance during expiration are normally higher than those of inhalation due
mainly to the effect of the surrounding tissue and pressures. During inhalation, pleural
pressures are more negative than in the airways, thus pulling the conducting airways open. As
they open, resistance decreases. On the other hand, exhalation is produced by positive pleural
pressures, which tend to push the airways closed. Resistance increases.44
Different airway segments do not contribute equally to the difference in resistance during
exhalation and inhalation. Because of the pressure drop as air flows through airways
resistance, pressures in the upper airways are always closer to atmospheric pressure (except
for positive-pressure ventilation of hospital patients and people wearing pressurized airsupplied respirator masks) than lower airways. Thus the pressure difference between airways
and pleural spaces, and consequently the tendency toward airway opening during inspiration
and closure during expiration, is greater in the upper airways than lower airways.
The upper airways, however, are stiffer than the lower airways, and thus can resist
transmural pressure differences easier. The greatest effect of inhalation/exhalation on airway
resistance is thus most likely to be felt in the middle airways, perhaps at generations 8–18.
This area is usually considered to be the lower airways.
Up to now, we have dealt with measurements which were made at a thoracic gas volume
Vtg, of FRC. Airflow rate has been allowed to vary to give a pressure-flow relationship given
by Equation 4.2.70. If flow rate is maintained at 10-3m3/sec (1 L/sec) and thoracic gas volume
varies, airway resistance is found to be inversely proportional to lung volume for reasons
similar to the preceding discussion on effect of inhalation and exhalation (see also Equation
4.4.30b). Briscoe and DuBois (1958) experimentally showed for men of different ages and
body sizes45 that

Raw = 98,030/(280V - 0.204)

(4.2.75)

where Raw = airway resistance, N·sec/m5
V = lung volume, m3
Raw values would be expected to be divided by 0.8 for women (larger resistances than for
men). Blide et al. (1964) showed that most of the effect of lung volume occurs in the lower
airways.
Notice in Equation 4.2.75 that Raw. becomes infinite before lung volume becomes zero.
This is because the lower airways close before the lung completely empties. The volume at
which this occurs is termed the "closing volume" and corresponds to the residual volume in
Table 4.2.3.
The combination of flow rate and lung volume effects on airway resistance requires
complicated curve-fitting techniques. Consequently, very little information is available on
subject averages including both effects. Johnson (1986), beginning with traditional description
equations (4.2.71 and 4.2.75), matched inhalation data appearing in Bouhuys and Jonson
(1967) for subject number 2 (male nonsmoker), redrawn as Figure 4.2.19:
p = 98,030 VDi [0.744 + 426 VDi + 6.79 x 10 /(V – RV)]
–4

(4.2.76)

44
When airway lumen diameter is larger, one would expect a larger dead volume to be present. Therefore, dead volume should
be somewhat smaller during exhalation compared to inhalation.
45
They also measured women's Raw = 98,030/290V - 0.078) and children's Raw = 98,030/140V + 0.069). There is a value for lung
volume where men's and women's airway resistance becomes infinite (7.3 x 10-4 m3 and 2.7 x 10-4 m3, respectively), but there is
no volume where children's airway resistance becomes infinite.

(4.2.77)

Description of exhalation resistance is complicated by the fact that pressures surrounding
the airways tend to close them. It has been known for years that if transpulmonary pressure
and expiratory flow rate are plotted along lines of equal lung volume, (1) a point is reached on
each of these curves beyond which the flow cannot be increased (Figure 4.2.20), (2)
sometimes flow rate is actually seen to decrease with increased pressure, and (3) the limiting
flow rate decreases as lung volume decreases.46 Since resistance is pressure divided by flow
rate, resistance becomes very high once flow is limited.
46

Peak expiratory flow rate also appears to be determined by a circadian rhythm (Cinkotai et al., 1984).


210

Figure 4.2.20 Expiratory isovolume pressure-flow data for the same subject as in Figure 4.2.19. Note
that flow rates reach a limiting value in exhalation. When this happens, exhalation flow resistance is
extremely high. (Adapted and used with permission from Bouhuys and Jonson, 1967.)

There are several explanations for this apparent increase in resistance. We have already
begun the discussion with a consideration of pressures external to the tubes. To this will be
added energy considerations.
An energy balance on a fluid system results in Bernoulli's equation:

Values for α depend on the profile of the velocity across the diameter of the tube and are usually taken to be 1.0 for turbulent
flow and 2.0 for fully developed laminar flow. Non-Newtonian fluids (see Section 3.2.1) give other values for α.

Figure 4.2.21 Collapse of airways during a forced expiration is due to external pressures exceeding
internal pressures. Internal pressures diminish as flow rate increases.

For illustrative purposes, we can neglect differences in height and friction loss. The only two
terms left involve pressure and flow rate. Since the sum of these two terms must be zero, any
increase in one of these decreases the other. That is, if flow rate increases, as it does during a
forced exhalation, static pressure must decrease. Static pressure inside a tube greater than
static pressure outside a tube aids the rigidity of the tube wall in maintaining the tube opening.
When static pressure decreases, tubes without totally stiff walls tend to collapse,48 because
external pressure is much greater than internal pressure (Figure 4.2.21). The same effect is
seen in segments of the cardiovascular system (Section 3.5.2).
Collapse (or pinching) of the air passages increases resistance, thus increasing friction
and reducing flow rate. Therefore, a dynamic balance is established, whereby flow rate
remains constant. An increase in external pressure, which can occur during a particularly
forceful exhalation, can actually decrease maximum flow rate because of its adverse effect on
airway transmural pressure.49 Similarly, a decrease in lung volume, which would tends to
reduce tissue rigidity, would cause tube pinching, or collapse, at a lower flow rate.
Recently, these effects were quantified somewhat by the wave-speed formulation
(Dawson and Elliott, 1977; Mead, 1980; Thiriet and Bonis, 1983). In this theory, the
maximum velocity of airflow rate through a collapsible tube is taken to be the velocity of
propagation of a pressure wave along the tube-in effect, the local sonic velocity. The speed of
pressure wave propagation is

The term (dptm/dA) is the tube characteristic, showing the rate of tube narrowing for a change

Rather than measuring (dptm/dA) it is easier to measure ptm versus A of excised airways
and take the slope of the generated curve (Martin and Proctor, 1958). In that case, however,

Vorosmarti (1979) showed that the addition of a resistance element external to the mouth did not affect the limiting flow until
its resistance exceeded the internal now-limiting resistance.

specific airway tested.

transmural pressure or cross-sectional area must be known (Figure 4.2.22). Transmural
pressure is the sum of elastic pressure (due to lung compliance) and frictional pressure drop
along the tube. If these can be determined, then (dptm/dA) can be determined, A can be
determined, and the wave-speed airflow rate can be known. Airflow rate through the tube
cannot exceed the wave speed.
Where is flow limited? During inhalation and quiet exhalation it is not. Mead (1978,
1980) offered evidence that the only flow rates which attain a sufficiently high value to be
limited occur in the neighborhood of the carina, descending perhaps to the lobar bronchi
(generation 2). At very low lung volumes (around residual volume), however, the site of the
flow limitation must shift50 to the extreme lower airways, since the closing volume is taken to
be an indication of the health of the lower airways.
Air is a compressible gas, but compression effects may be neglected as long as the rate of
airflow does not approach the speed of sound. The Mach number indicates the importance of
compression effects:
Mc = v/vs

(4.2.80)

where Mc = Mach number, dimensionless
v = air speed, m/sec
vs = sonic velocity, m/sec
Compression effects become dominant when the Mach number becomes 1.0. Since the speed
of sound51 is about 360 m/sec and mean flow speed in the trachea is about 3.9 m/sec when
volume rate of flow is 10-3 m3/sec (1 L/sec), Mach number is 0.01, and compressibility is not
important (except during breathing maneuvers such as coughs and sneezes).
Description of exhalation resistance in a manner similar to inhalation resistances of
Equations 4.2.76 and 4.2.77 is difficult and somewhat arbitrary. Nevertheless, Johnson (1986)
reduced airways pressure data of Bouhuys and Jonson (1967) to equation form by starting

This shift can be a rather abrupt one.

with the inhalation formulations given by Equations 4.2.76 and 4.2.77. At low flows and large
lung volumes, exhalation isovolume pressure-flow (IVPF) curves are nearly coincident with
mirror images of inhalation IVPF curves. Johnson therefore proposed to model exhalation
IVPF curves by adding another resistive component to the inhalation IVPF formulations in
Equations 4.2.76 and 4.2.77. This model is consistent with physiological evidence attributing
the limiting flow rate to a local change in airway dimensions (Mead et al., 1967). It is not
consistent with reports of negative effort dependence of limiting flow rate (Suzuki et al.,
1982).
The general form for exhalation pressure-flow relations becomes (Johnson and Milano,
1987)

pe = p̂i + K4[1 – Ve / VL ) – 1]

(4.2.81)

where pe = exhalation pressure loss across airway resistance, N/m2
p̂i = predicted inhalation pressure loss across airway resistance at the exhalation flow
rate, N/m2

Ve = exhalation flow rate (considered to be positive), m3/sec
VL = limiting flow rate, m3/sec
K4 = constant, N/m2
and

p̂i = K1 Ve + K2 Ve 2 + K3 Ve /(V – RV)

(4.2.82)

Specific values of the constants K1, K2, and K3 are given in Equations 4.2.76 and 4.2.77.
Limiting flow rate VL is the maximum flow rate that can be expelled from the lungs
(Figure 4.2.20). Because expanded lungs hold air passages open wider than contracted lungs,
limiting flow rate has been found to depend on lung volume:
VL = K5(V – RV)

Johnson (1986) found, for Bouhuys and Jonson (1967) subject 2,

(4.2.86)
(4.2.87)

An additional body mass correction can be applied to resistance values. Since the
experiments from which corrective data were obtained came from intubated animals, upper
airway resistance is not included in the data. This is a severe limitation, since most resistance
at the high flow rates encountered during exercise occurs in the upper airways.
Notwithstanding, the relationship between pulmonary resistance (excluding upper airway
resistance) and body mass is seen in Figure 4.2.23, and equations are

Raw – Ruaw = (21.0 x 105)m–0.862

(4.2.88a)

Rp – Ruaw[ = (40.4 x 105)m–0.903

(4.2.88b)

Rr – Ruaw = (21.0 x 105)m–0.393

Ruaw = upper airway resistance, N·sec/m5
Rp = pulmonary resistance, N·sec/m5

A consequence of Bernoulli's equation (4.2.78) is that when flow rate changes for any
reason, an equivalent resistance must be inserted into the flow pathway. This is especially true
where differential pressure measurements are made such that one side of the pressure
measurement is made where there is no flow at all. Specifically, if one side of the pressure
measurement is made in the atmosphere, then a resistance term must be inserted between the
atmosphere and the point of pressure measurement (such as at the mouth). The value of this
resistance is found from kinetic energy changes and is found to be

Requiv =

αγVD
2 gA 2

(4.2.89)

where symbols are defined for Equation 4.2.78 and pressure drop caused by this resistance is
∆p=

(4.2.90)

This resistance may be significant for some systems.
Compliance. Compliance is the term that accounts for energy stored in the lungs due to
elastic recoil tendencies. All muscular energy that is invested into a pure compliance vessel is
returned, and this is used at rest by the respiratory system; exhalation is considered passive,
requiring only stored elastic force to propel air from the lungs.


215

Figure 4.2.24 The volume-pressure curve for lungs plus chest wall in a living subject. Compliance is the
ratio of volume to pressure and therefore is the slope of the curve. Static compliance is taken to be the
slope of the line drawn from the point of zero pressure and lung volume of FRC to any other point on the
curve. Dynamic compliance is the slope of the curve at any point. Static compliance at lung volume V1 is
given by ∆V/∆p. Dynamic compliance at the same lung volume is δV/δp.

There are compliances in the airways, lung tissue, and chest wall. Airways compliance is
often considered negligible and the other two are considered, in our mechanical models, to be
effectively in series.
When both are considered together, as in Figure 4.2.15, respiratory system compliance is
found by measuring mouth (or esophageal) pressure at zero flow. Figure 4.2.24 is typical
volume-pressure curve for the respiratory system. Pressure measurements are referenced to
relaxation pressure, at FRC. At FRC, the compliance, given as the inverse of the slope of the
pressure-volume characteristic, is usually assumed to be constant (Mead, 1961). Some authors
consider the compliance in the inhalation direction to be a different constant from the
compliance in the exhalation direction (Yamashiro et al., t975). As can be seen, however, the
slope of the curve is not constant but depends on lung volume. At the extremes of residual
volume and vital capacity, the respiratory system becomes much less compliant and large
pressure changes accompany small lung volume changes.
For modeling purposes the pressure-volume curve can be described simply (Johnson,
1984) by
VC/V = 1.00 + exp (b - cp)

(4.2.91)

where VC = vital capacity, m3
V = lung volume above the residual volume (RV), m3
b = coefficient, dimensionless
c = coefficient, m2/N
p = mouth pressure, N/m2
Values for the coefficient b have been found to be 1.01 (data from Jacquez, 1979) and 1.66
(data from Yamashiro et al., 1975, subject c). Values for the coefficient c were found to be
1.81 x 10-3 m2/N and 1.03 x 10-3 m2/N (from the same references, respectively).


216

Static compliance is determined during a single exhalation from maximum lung volume
by simultaneously measuring lung volume and pressure. Static compliance represents a
straight line connecting any desired point on the curve with one at zero pressure (Figure
4.2.24). Thus static compliance is

Cstat =

V1 − V0
p1 − 0

(4.2.92)

From Equation 4.2.91,

Cstat =

V1 − FRC

(4.2.93)

 VC 
− 1
b/c - 1/c ln
 V1


Dynamic compliance is determined during breathing by measuring lung volume and
pressure whenever airflow is zero (and thus no pressure drop across resistance). This occurs at
end-inspiration and end-expiration. Dynamic compliance for quiet breathing represents the
slope of a line connecting a point on the curve at zero pressure with a point on the curve at
end-inspiration. That is,

Cdyn =

VT
p1

(4.2.94)

Dynamic compliance can also be considered by bioengineers to be the slope of the curve
evaluated at a single point. That is,

Cdyn = dV/dp p = p1

(4.2.95)

From the relationship in Equation 4.2.91,

Cdyn =

VCcexp(b - cp)

(4.2.96)

[1 + exp(b - cp)]2

Because the slope of the curve in Figure 4.2.24 decreases at the end points, slopes taken over
wider central ranges of the curve are generally less than those over narrower ranges. Aside
from other physiological conditions, this is an explanation for the general observation that Cdyn
< Cstat (Mead, 1961).
The actual value of compliance depends on a number of factors all relating to the
stiffness of the lung and thoracic tissue. These include chest cage muscle tone, amount of
blood flow through the lungs, and bronchoconstriction. Pulmonary compliance is sometimes
considered to be higher during exhalation than during inhalation. Compliance in normal
humans is nearly constant as breathing frequency increases but decreases with frequency in
patients with chronic airway obstruction (Mead, 1961).
Lung tissue compliance and chest wall compliance are sometimes measured separately.
When this is done, both compliance terms are usually based on lung volume (although chest
wall compliance more properly applies to differences in chest wall posture). Lung tissue
compliance is defined as

Clt =

V
p A − p pl

`

(4.2.97)


217

where Clt = lung tissue compliance, m5/N
V = lung volume, m3
pA = alveolar pressure, N/m2
ppl = pleural pressure, N/m2
and chest wall compliance is

Ccw =

V
p pl − p o

(4.2.98)

where Ccw = chest wall compliance, m5/N
po = pressure outside the body, N/m2
Thus, taken together in series, total compliance C is

C cw C lt
V
=
C cw + C lt p A
Like resistance terms, compliance terms vary with body mass:
C=

Hysteresis is present in all measurements. (Adapted and used with permission from Agostoni and Mead,

218

Clt = lung tissue compliance, m5/N
Ccw = chest wall compliance, m5/N
Specific compliance, which is defined as compliance divided by FRC, appears to assume a
nearly constant value of 0.00082 m2/N (0.08/cm H2O) for the whole size spectrum of
mammals from bat to whale (Mines, 1981).
Figure 4.2.25 shows measurements of lung tissue, chest wall, and total respiratory
compliances. Measurements consistently show hysteresis; that is, the curve traced in one
direction is not the same as the curve traced in the opposite direction. Lung tissue
measurements manifest much more hysteresis than chest wall measurements; this is
attributable to changes in alveolar surface tension between expansion and contraction due to
the surfactant coating (Section 4.2.1). Hysteresis means that all the work stored in expanding
the lungs is not recovered upon contraction. This can be seen by considering work to be
W = pV

(4.2.103)

where W = work, N·m
p = pressure change during the process, N/m2
V = lung volume change during the process, m3
Work involved in expansion is the area from the left-hand axis of Figure 4.2.25 to one of the
lung expansion curves (the arrow pointing up and to the right). Work involved in the
subsequent contraction is the area from the left-and axis to the contraction curve (arrow
pointing down and to the left) corresponding to the expansion curve chosen before. The work
involved in contraction is less than that for expansion.
Hysteresis is difficult to include in simple linear models and is therefore usually ignored.
Hysteresis is a system nonlinearity which makes the present state of the lung precisely
determinable only once its expansion history is known.
Inertance. Very few measurements of respiratory inertance have been made (Mead, 1961).
Pressure expended on inertance in the lungs has been estimated to be about 0.5% during quiet
breathing and up to 5% during heavy exercise (Mead, 1961). Most inertance is believed to
exist in the gas moving through the respiratory system and very little due to lung tissues. Little
information is available on chest wall inertance. Since gas, lung tissue, and chest wall
inertances are considered to be in series, total inertance is the sum of these. Inertance is
usually considered to be small enough to be neglected in respiratory system models. During
exercise, however, where breathing waveforms have a relatively high airflow acceleration,
inertia may play an important role in limiting the rate at which air can be moved.
The natural frequency of an R-I-C circuit can be given as

ωn =

1 
R 2 
1−
IC  4 I / C 

(4.2.104)

where ωn = natural frequency, rad/sec
I = inertance, N·sec2/m5
C = compliance, m5/N
R = resistance, N·sec/m5
The resistance in the circuit dissipates energy and can act to dampen any oscillations that may
occur in response to a disturbance. The term ( R / 2) C / I , called the damping ratio, is
usually given the symbol ζ. If the damping ratio is less than 1, the circuit is said to be
underdamped, and oscillations can occur. With values of R, I, and C that appear in Table
4.2.15, the damping ratio of the respiratory system is about 4.3, making this system extremely
overdamped: oscillations do not spontaneously occur and the gas and tissue of the respiratory


219

system closely follow the respiratory muscles. If the respiratory system were not overdamped,
a very disconcerting and uncontrollable flow of air in and out of the mouth would occur when
the system was jarred in the slightest way.
The respiratory system is recognized to have a natural frequency, however, but this is
recognized only when the inertance and compliance terms disappear from measurements and
only resistance remains.
Reactance of a compliance is given by

Xc =

1
jω C

(4.2.105)

where Xc = reactance of compliance, N·sec/m5
ω = frequency, rad/sec
j = imaginary operator, denoting a phase angle between pressure and flow
Reactance of an inertance is given by

XI = jωI

(4.2.106)

where XI = reactance of inertance, N·sec/m5
When XI = XL,,

1
= jω n I
jω n C

(4.2.107)

ω n = 1 / IC

(4.2.108)

and

The frequency ωn, called the undamped natural frequency, represents the frequency at which
oscillations would occur if no damping were present. Natural frequencies of the respiratory
systems of normal individuals are in the range 38–50 rad/sec (6–8 cycles/sec). Using a mean
value of 45 rad/sec and a pulmonary compliance of 1.22 x 10-6 m5/N gives a calculated
pulmonary inertance of 405 N·sec2/m5.
Time Constant. When inertance is ignored, the inverse of the product of resistance times
compliance, which has the units of seconds, is called the time constant of the lung:
τ = 1/RC

(4.2.109)

where τ = time constant, sec
R = resistance, N·m5/sec
C = compliance, m5/N
Lung time constant determines the time required for filling and emptying the lungs. This is
especially seen during passive exhalation, which has an exponential airflow waveshape
(Figure 4.3.35a). The time constant of the exhalation is 1/RC and has a value of about 0.66 sec
(Mead, 1960).
Since dynamic compliance values have been found to be independent of breathing
frequency from 0 to 1.5 breaths/sec, Mead (1961) argues that this implies that the time
constants for various lung segments must be the same. Dynamic compliance would be
independent of frequency only if the volume change in each of the pathways to various parts
of the lung remained in fixed proportion to the total volume change of the lungs at all
frequencies. If not, the nonlinear pressure-volume characteristic would cause a change in
measured compliance. The only way this could be expected to occur is if each lung portion


220

filled at the same rate, thus implying equal time constants. In abnormal patients—those with
bronchoconstriction, asthma, and chronic emphysema, where time constants of filling are
known to differ in different parts of the lung—dynamic compliance measurements vary with
breathing rate. In central regions of the lung, which are expected to have less flow resistance
than peripheral regions, the condition of equal time constants requires that central compliance
is greater than in peripheral regions (Mead, 1961).
Respiratory Work. The work of the respiratory muscles is composed of two components:
the work of breathing and the work of maintaining posture. Although not a great amount of
work has been done concerning the latter, it has been stated that a considerable amount of
respiratory muscular work is involved in the maintenance of thoracic shape (Grodins and
Yamashiro, 1978). For instance, as the diaphragm pulls air into the lungs, the intercostal
muscles move the ribs up and out to further increase chest volume. The coordination of this
effort requires both positive and negative work (see Section 5.2.5).
The work of breathing can be expressed as

W = pplV=
where W = work, N·m
ppl = intrapleural pressure, N/m2
V = lung volume, m3

∫ p Vdt
pl

(4.2.110)

Figure 4.2.26 Pressure-volume loops for maximum breathing effort with four levels of airway resistance.
As resistance increases the area enclosed by the loops, and thus the respiratory work, increases. Muscular
inefficiencies increase the required respiratory work even more. When resistance is so high that required
pressures cannot be generated by the respiratory muscles, respiratory work again decreases. (Adapted and
used with permission from Bartlett, 1973.)


221

VD = airflow rate, m3/sec
t = time, sec
This amount of work can be seen as the enclosed area of the loop in Figure 4.2.26.
Since the efficiency of the respiratory muscles (see Section 5.2.5) has been estimated at
7–11% (mean 8.5%) in normal individuals and at 1–3% (mean 1.8%) for emphysemic
individuals (Cherniack, 1959), the amount of oxygen consumption that the body spends on
respiration can be considerable (Tables 4.2.20 and 4.2.21) during exercise.
The pressure-volume curves of Figure 4.2.26 directly indicate respiratory work for four
different breathing resistances. In each of these figures appears a loop. If there were no
resistance in the respiratory system, the loops would be very narrow, almost a diagonal line
from the upper left-hand corner to the lower right-hand corner of the loop. These narrow loops
would correspond to the compliance curves of Figure 4.2.25. With resistance, however, more
work must be expended to inhale and less energy is recovered during exhalation. Because the
resistive component of pressure requires that negative inspiratory pressures become more
negative and positive expiratory pressures become more positive, the loops widen. From
Equation 4.2.107 we see that the area enclosed by the loops represents work done by the
respiratory system on the air and tissues being moved. It does not represent total physiological
work, however, because muscular efficiency is not included.
At low resistance (294 kN·sec/m5 or 3.00 cm H2O·sec/L) the area under the curve of
Figure 4.2.26 is relatively small. For higher resistance of 735 and 1323 kN·sec/m5 (7.50 and
1.350 cm H2O·sec/L) the volume of air remains nearly the same, but exerted pressures are
increased. Mechanical work therefore increases. With a still higher resistance of 3970
kN·sec/m5 (40.5 cm H2O·sec/L), the respiratory muscular pressure becomes limited and work
decreases. All curves are maximum exertion at 0.67 breath/sec, and therefore respiratory
volume decreases for the largest resistance (to maintain the same volume, a longer time would

have been required, an effect which is seen during spontaneous breathing). It can be seen that
there is a maximum work output which occurs at the intermediate resistance values.
The oxygen cost of breathing through these resistances was found to be relatively
constant across the range of breathing resistances (Bartlett, 1973). Since the caloric equivalent
of oxygen remains nearly constant at about 20.2 N·m/cm3, respiratory efficiency is highest
where the mechanical work is highest.
4.3 CONTROL OF RESPIRATION
Regulation of respiration means different things to different people. To some, it means the
way in which the periodic breathing pattern is generated and controlled; to others, respiratory
regulation means the control of ventilation, and the reciprocating nature of airflow could just
as well be considered to be continuous flow; to yet others, respiratory regulation deals with
optimization and the means with which various respiratory parameters are determined.
In a sense, this multiplicity of views has hindered development of comprehensive
respiratory models. In surveying the recent literature, it can be said (although it is difficult to
substantiate) that more information is known about the respiratory system than about any of
the other systems dealt with in this book. Yet less is known about how pieces of this
information relate to each other. The difficulty to be encountered, then, is one of integration
and synthesis.
The nature of respiratory control causes this to be a very complex topic. Unlike
cardiovascular control, the basic act of breathing is not initiated within the respiratory
muscles; therefore, external inputs cannot be considered to be modifying influences only.
Unlike the thermoregulatory system, the details of the process of respiration are considered to
be important, and the amount of pertinent information therefore cannot be reduced to a
relatively few coarse measurements. Thus on the one hand much is known about regulation of
respiration, but on the other hand not enough is known to serve as the basis for comprehensive
models.
In this chapter, as well as the chapters on other physiological systems, we deal with
sensors, controller, and effector organs. However, as will be seen, the respiratory system

mixtures at 1 atm pressure. Acute changes are more profound than chronic changes. (Adapted and used
with permission from Billings, 1963.)


223

sometimes acts as if there are sensors which have not yet been found to exist, control is not
localized to one particular region, and the effector organs are many.
It has been seen in Chapter 3 that cardiovascular control appears to be directed toward
maintenance of adequate flow first to the brain and then to other parts of the body. Likewise,
it will be seen in Chapter 5 that thermoregulation appears to regulate first the temperature of
brain structures and then the remainder of the body. In a similar fashion, respiratory control
appears to be coordinated such that an adequate chemical milieu is provided to the brain and
other structures are subordinate to that goal. Because chemical supply to the brain comes
through the blood, cardiovascular and respiratory control are often entwined, with
complementary or interactive responses occurring in both systems.

If a single controlled variable had to be identified for the respiratory controller, it would
have to be pH of the fluid bathing areas of the lower brain. This relates directly to the carbon
dioxide partial pressure of the blood. A very small excess of carbon dioxide in inhaled air
produces severe psychophysiological reactions (Figure 4.3.1), and respiratory responses to
inhaled carbon dioxide are profound (Figure 4.3.2). Surprisingly, lack of oxygen does not
evoke strong responses at all, leading one to believe that in the environment where respiratory
control evolved, oxygen was almost always in plentiful supply and carbon dioxide was not;
the threat to survival came from carbon dioxide excess and not from oxygen lack. The
controlling process is considered in detail in the remainder of this section.
Dejours (1963) notes that "when a subject starts easy dynamic exercise, ventilation
increases immediately; then, during the next 20–30 seconds following the onset of exercise,
ventilation remains constant. After this lag, it increases progressively and eventually, if the
exercise is not too intense, reaches a steady state." He termed the initial, fast ventilatory
increase as the neural component, and the second, slower increase as the humoral, or
chemical, component. There is wide agreement today that both neural and humoral
components contribute to respiratory control; there is no such agreement about the relative
speed of each (Whipp, 1981), and it may be that both neural and humoral components act both
fast and slowly.
Figure 4.3.3 shows the general scheme for respiratory control. The system is highly
complex, with each block of the diagram corresponding to several major sites. The location
and function of each of these are discussed in succeeding sections.
4.3.1

Respiratory Receptors

As seen in Figure 4.3.3, there is a host of receptor types which have been identified as having
importance to respiration. Since respiration is a complex function, with ventilatory control
superimposed on the basic respiratory rhythm, each group of sensors is required to properly
regulate the respiratory system. We deal with these receptors in two groups: sensors
functioning in chemical control and sensors relaying mechanical information.
Chemoreceptors. It is generally believed that chemoreceptors important to respiratory
control exist peripherally in the aortic arch and carotid bodies and centrally in the ventral


225

heart and carotid bodies are located in the neck. (Used with permission from Ganong, 1963.)

medulla oblongata of the brain (Bledsoe and Hornbein, 1981). These receptors appear to be
sensitive to partial pressures of CO2 and O2 and to pH.
Some peripheral chemoreceptors have been localized to the carotid bodies (Hornbein,
1966; McDonald, 1981), tiny and very vascular nodules located in the neck near the ascending
common carotid arteries (Figure 4.3.4). On an equal mass basis, blood flow in the carotid
body is about 40 times greater than through the brain and 5 times greater than through the
kidney (Ganong, 1963),52 and thus these bodies are very sensitive to sudden changes in blood
composition. Information from glomus cells within the carotid bodies is transmitted to the
brain through the glossopharyngeal nerve (Hornbein, 1966).
Carotid bodies appear to be sensitive to changes in arterial pO2,53 pCO2, and pH. Figure
4.3.5 and 4.3.6 show neural responses54 of the carotid sinus nerve of the cat for varying
arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures.
It is not entirely clear that the carotid body response to pCO2, is independent of pH
response or that both responses are manifestations of the same effect (Biscoe and Willshaw,
1981). Hornbein (1966) asserts that steady-state responses to CO2, are entirely due to pH
(Figures 4.3.7–4.3.9). Increased pCO2 evokes a prompter response than a change in acidity,
probably because CO2 diffuses more readily into the chemoreceptor cells to produce a more
rapid fall in pH. Combined hypoxia (below normal pO2) and hypercapnia (above normal
pCO2) produce an interaction which is greater (Figure 4.3.7) than the added effects of both
taken singly (Hornbein, 1966).
52
Each carotid body has a mass of 2 mg and receives a blood flow of 0.33 cm3/g of tissue per second; the brain averages
0.009cm3/g·sec blood flow (Ganong, 1963).
53
The blood flow through the carotid body is so great that oxygen demands are met by dissolved oxygen only. The carotid
bodies do not seem to be sensitive to oxygen bound to hemoglobin except as it affects pO2 Thus hemoglobin abnormalities
produce no exceptional response (Ganong, 1963).
54
These neural responses are averages taken over a relatively long time. There is actually a good deal of irregularity in single
unit discharges, which seems to follow a Poisson probability distribution. The probability of the occurrence of an action
potential is never zero, meaning that there is no threshold level of chemical input below which the fiber cannot respond (Biscoe
and Willshaw, 1981).


226

Figure 4.3.5 Changes in neural output from the carotid sinus nerve of the cat when arterial carbon
dioxide partial pressure is changed. The relation between carbon dioxide partial pressure and nervous
discharge is linear. Normal changes in carbon dioxide are very small and normal values are about 5.2

Bartels and Witzleb, 1956.)

Figure 4.3.6 Changes in neural output from the carotid sinus nerve of the cat when arterial oxygen partial
pressure is changed. The relationship is decidedly nonlinear, with maximum sensitivity at high oxygen
partial pressures. Normal values are 13.3 kN/m2 (100 mm Hg) in man. (Adapted and used with

Figure 4.3.7 Average neural discharge from the carotid body of the cat in response to changes of arterial
oxygen partial pressure. Each curve was elicited with a carbon dioxide partial pressure given in N/m2

different curves indicates interaction between oxygen and carbon dioxide sensitivity. (Adapted and used

inspired carbon dioxide. The nearly linear portion of the curve compares to that in Figure 4.3.5. Addition

inspired carbon dioxide. Sodium bicarbonate was added to change blood pH. When neural discharge is

permission from Hornbein and Roos, 1963.)

Carotid chemoreceptors have very rapid response. They can follow tidal changes in
arterial blood gas tensions (Biscoe and Willshaw, 1981) which occur during each breath (see
Section 4.2.2). Whether or not there is an output frequency component related to the rate of
change of pCO2, and pH is still open to question (Biscoe and Willshaw, 1981), although many
other somatic receptors do exhibit transient components (see Sections 3.3.1 and 5.3.1) and it
would be somewhat surprising if the carotid bodies were not similar.
There are neural and chemical means to alter the output of the carotid body.
Catecholamines injected into the arterial supply of the carotid body of cats cause transient
depression of chemoreceptor output (Biscoe and Willshaw, 1981); carotid sinus nerve
excitation can cause depression of chemoreceptor activity; and excitation of the sympathetic
nerve supply to the carotid body causes an increase in chemoreceptor output (Biscoe and
Willshaw, 1981).55
The other major peripheral chemosensitive area is in the region of the aortic arch.
Because of their anatomical location, the aortic bodies have not been studied in as much detail
as the carotid bodies. They are assumed to respond similarly to carotid bodies.
Other peripheral receptors play a minor role in respiratory regulation. Among these are
chemoreceptors in the coronary and pulmonary vessels (Ganong, 1963). There is also a great
deal of interaction between cardiovascular sensors and responses and pulmonary sensors and
responses.
There is located within 0.5 mm of the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata (at the
junction of spinal cord and brain) a central chemoreceptive site (Bledsoe and Hornbein, 1981;
Ganong, 1963; Hornbein, 1966). This site does not appear to be sensitive to anoxia and may
have limited sensitivity to carbon dioxide. By far its greatest, and perhaps its only practical
sensitivity is to pH, or hydrogen ion concentration in the brain extracellular fluid (Bledsoe and
Hornbein, 1981).
An indirectness occurs here, however. There are epithelial layers between the blood and
cerebrospinal fluid which are poorly permeable to most polar solutes (ions), and which have
specialized transport systems to facilitate carriage of glucose, lactate, and amino acids
(Bledsoe and Hornbein, 1981). These are called the "blood–brain barrier" and appear to serve
55

This could be at least part of the link among psychological state, exercise, and respiration.


229

as protection for the brain against harmful substances or changes which occur in the blood.
Hydrogen ions do not easily cross the blood–brain barrier.
Carbon dioxide, probably in hydrated form, can easily move across this barrier, and, by
means of the buffer equation (3.2.3),
H2O + CO2 ⇐⇒ H2CO3 ⇐⇒ H+ + HCO3–

(3.2.3)

change the hydrogen ion concentration of cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, there appears to
be some active buffering of bicarbonate (HCO3–) levels by brain cells to minimize HCO3–
concentration differences in the brain extracellular fluid (Bledsoe and Hornbein, 1981).56
These mechanisms seem to indicate that the composition of the fluid bathing the brain
cells is controlled to a high degree but can lead to some interesting, and somewhat
paradoxical, results. For instance, pH shifts in the cerebrospinal fluid must always be slower
than pCO2, and pH shifts in the blood. Such shifts will likely be much smaller in cerebrospinal
fluid than in blood. Also, metabolic acidosis, occurring naturally during exercise above the
anaerobic threshold, stimulates ventilation (presumably from peripheral chemoreceptor

The distinction between brain extracellular fluid and cerebrospinal fluid is that the former is more local than the latter, and

excitation), thereby lowering arterial pCO2. When pCO2 is lowered, Equation 3.2.3 indicates
that H+ concentration will be lowered. Thus the blood will be observed to be acidic and the
cerebrospinal fluid alkaline (Hornbein, 1966).
Measurements of alveolar ventilation were made on conscious goats while cerebrospinal
fluid composition was monitored during various metabolic states (Jacquez, 1979). The results
appear in Figure 4.3.10 and the relation between these variables can be described as
log VA = 48.1 − 7.14 pH

(4.3.1)

where V A = alveolar ventilation rate, m3/sec
pH = acidity, pH units (dimensionless)
Notice the amount of scatter in the data and the very small change in pH which produces a
large change in alveolar ventilation.57
Mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors produce inputs which are responsible for
nonchernial respiratory regulation. Such things as the basic rhythmic respiratory oscillation,
initial respiratory stimulation at the onset of exercise, removal of irritants in the respiratory
pathway, and control of airway caliber are influenced by these receptors.
Active and passive movement of the limbs stimulates respiration (Celli, 1988; Ganong,
1963; Jammes et al., 1984.58 Proprioceptor afferent pathways from muscles, tendons, and
joints to the brain normally function to inform the brain of the positions and conditions of
bodily members (Duron, 1981). These proprioceptors appear to exert an influence on the
increase of ventilation during exercise.
A host of different mechanoreceptors are located throughout the respiratory tract
(Widdicombe, 1981, 1982). Nasal receptors are important in sneezing, apnea,59
bronchodilation/bronchoconstriction, secretion of mucus, and the diving reflex (see footnote
79, Section 3.3.1). Laryngeal receptors appear to be important in coughing, apnea,
swallowing, bronchoconstriction, airway mucus secretion, and laryngeal constriction.
Tracheobronchial receptors are important in coughing, pulmonary hypertension,
bronchoconstriction, laryngeal constriction, and production of mucus. Information about each
of these receptor types is abundant but incomplete. There is no clear distinction between these
receptors and those serving other functions, such as smell. The overall function of these
receptors appears to be respiratory system support, including protection from irritants, but
does not appear to be involved with control of respiratory rhythm or ventilation (Widdicombe,
1981).
There is a class of mechanoreceptors which seems to be somewhat important in the
generation of the respiratory rhythmic pattern. Some are present in the tracheobronchial tree
and some within the respiratory muscles (Duron, 1981; Widdicombe, 1981; Young, 1966).
Some of these receptors increase their output discharge frequencies with increasing lung and
chest inflation; others increase their outputs when the lung or chest is underinflated. Slowly
adapting receptors fire with relatively slight degrees of lung distension, whereas rapidly
adapting receptors respond only to rapid and forcible lung distension. The outputs of both
types eventually decrease to zero with no further change in lung distension. The sensitivity of
these receptors is enhanced by a decrease in lung compliance (Widdicombe, 1981). These
receptors are joined to the brain via the vagus nerve.
57

The reader should be cautioned that whereas the form of Equation 4.3.1 may be correct for other species, the actual predicted
values are not to be construed as applicable to humans. pH values for human cerebrospinal fluid is normally 7.4, with a range of
7.35–7.70 (Spector, 1956). These values do not appear on the abscissa of Figure 4.3.10.
58
Presumably, this mechanism could be used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary resuscitation to stimulate breathing. It has
been used to help revive animals overdosed with anesthesia.
59
Apnea is the term used for lack of breathing; hypernea means the deeper and more rapid breathing during exercise; eupnea is
easy, normal respiration at rest; dyspnea is stressful breathing; tachypnea is rapid breathing; and bradypnea is abnormally slow
respiration.


231

Baroreceptors (actually stretch receptors) in the carotid sinuses, aortic arch, and heart
atria and ventricles influence the respiratory system as well as the cardiovascular system (see
Section 3.3.1). This influence, increasing vascular pressure leading to inhibition of respiration,
is very slight, however (Ganong, 1963).
Other Inputs. There are excitatory and inhibitory afferent60 nerve fibers from the neocortex
to the respiratory controller, since breathing can become voluntarily controlled (although
respiration is more difficult to control voluntarily during exercise). Pain and emotional stimuli
affect respiration, presumably through a pathway from the hypothalamic area in the brain (see
Section 5.3.2).
4.3.2

Respiratory Controller

The respiratory controller must integrate many inputs from many outputs. That is, respiratory
control is very complex because it must first form the basic pattern of respiration and then
regulate it to respond appropriately to varying mechanical and chemical conditions.
Respiratory Rhythm. Generation of the basic respiratory rhythm has been generally
accepted to occur in the brainstem in the region of the pons and medulla (Mines, 1981;
Young, 1966). Most published works mention three centers: (1) the respiratory center
(composed of both inspiratory and expiratory centers), located bilaterally in the medulla,
which generates the basic respiratory oscillation; (2) the apneustic center,61 located caudally in
the pons, which supports an inspiratory drive; and (3) the pneumotaxic center, located in the
pons, which inhibits the respiratory center and supports expiration (Ganong, 1963; Mines,
1981). There is a good deal of uncertainty concerning the locations and functions of these
centers (Mitchell and Berger, 1981), and much has been written concerning and interrelating
experimental evidence.
Even the site of the generation of the basic respiratory rhythm is no longer clear. There is
new evidence that periodic nervous discharges can occur as low in the central nervous system
as the spinal cord, and how many of the three aforementioned centers are required to maintain
breathing is not well defined (Mitchell and Berger, 1981). It is possible that this oscillatory
discharge could come from pacemaker cells, similar to those in the heart, or from nonlinearly
acting, mutually inhibiting neural arrangements similar to electronic circuits.
Also unclear is the site and mechanism of controller implications of PCO 2 effects, either
directly on the central chemosensitive area or indirectly through the carotid bodies. Although
it is known that the glossopharyngeal nerve (the 9th cranial nerve) joins the brain in the area
of the medulla, pathways have not been established to ascertain exactly how afferent impulses
affect the respiratory drive.
With such a control system, diffused and detailed yet not conceptually assembled, we
must be somewhat more schematic rather than specific in our description. Refer, then, to
Figure 4.3.11 for a functional schematic of the respiratory system controller.
In this schematic, based on evidence and concepts presented by Mitchell and Berger
(1981), all known influences are not included. And, as previously mentioned, not enough is
known about some of the interconnections to be completely sure of all the details shown.
However, the essential actions are these: a central pattern generator, probably located in the
upper spinal cord, produces a series of repeating clusters of neural discharge, which is the
basic respiratory rhythm. By itself, the central pattern generator would produce a gasping type
of irregular breathing (severe apneusis). The central nervous pattern is modified by two
groups of respiratory neurons located in the medulla (together they are equivalent to the
medullary respiratory center). The dorsal group mainly controls the inspiratory muscles,

Afferent refers to input, efferent to output.
Apneusis is an abnormal form of respiration consisting of prolonged inspirations alternating with short expirations.

whereas the ventral respiratory group regulates both inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Both
neural groups are influenced by the pneumotaxic center in the pons. The pneumotaxic center
primarily inhibits output from the inspiratory center and acts to shape inspiration into a
smooth, coordinated action. Output from the dorsal inspiratory center, through phrenic
motoneurons, controls diaphragmatic movement. Output from the ventral group controls the
intercostal and abdominal muscles, and, through vagal motoneurons, airway muscle tone and
lung actions. Feedback from mechanoreceptor inputs is provided from the muscles by means
of spinal nerve afferent fibers and from the lungs and airways by means of vagal afferent
fibers. Carbon dioxide (or brain extracellular fluid pH) has a close and almost direct effect on
the respiratory center, and chemoreceptor glossopharyngeal nerve afferents affect the
generated pattern.
Airflow Waveshape. Breathing waveform, durations of inspiration and expiration, and endexpiratory volume (ERV; see Section 4.2.2) are all controlled as primary variables by the
respiratory controller. Air flows into the lungs whenever

pmus(i) – pmus(e) – pel > 0
where pmus(i) = lung pressure developed by inspiratory muscles, N/m2
p4mus(e) = lung pressure developed by expiratory muscles, N/m2
pel = pressure of elastic recoil of the respiratory system, N/m2

(4.3.2)


233

Figure 4.3.12 Typical shape of respiratory muscle occlusion pressure with time during inspiration.

At FRC, pel = 0; during quiet breathing, inspiratory and expiratory muscles will not be
simultaneously contracting, and therefore pmus(e) = 0; inspiration will thus occur whenever
pmus(i) > 0. The shape with time of pmus(i) can be approximately obtained by measuring pressure
in the respiratory system during occlusion (i.e., when no air is flowing).62 This shape during
quiet breathing is characterized by a finite rate of rise, a rounded peak, and rapid fall (Figure
4.3.12). The shape appears to be relatively constant from cycle to cycle in one individual in
any particular state but varies considerably between individuals and between different
conditions for one individual (Younes and Remmers, 1981). This shape is largely due to
diaphragmatic activity in response to phrenic nervous discharge: the greater the rate of
discharge, the greater the muscular force. The relation between inspiratory muscular pressure
pmus(i) and neural output is not linear or constant, however, and will depend on other factors to
be discussed in Section 4.3.3.
Hypercapnia increases the rate of rise of pmus(i) with time without changing its shape
(Younes and Remmers, 1981). If there is a plateau in pmus(i), it also rises. Body temperature
changes affect the rate of rise without changing the level of the plateau. Hypoxia and limb
movements, both active and passive, increase the rate of rise, but anesthetics and narcotics
depress the rate of rise (Younes and Remmers, 1981). Vagal volume feedback has been
reported to have little effect on inspiratory output prior to inspiratory termination (Younes and
Remmers, 1981).
Awake humans under steady-state conditions display substantial interbreath variation in
tidal volume, which is due mainly to inspiratory duration variability. Mean inspiratory flow
rates are also scattered, presumably from interbreath variation in the rate of rise of neural
output.63
Younes and Remmers (198 1) present equations relating the volume–time profiles of the
lungs to neural output. Inspiratory flow rate can be computed from
VDi =
62

ηN i − v(V − Vr ) − (V − Vr ) / C − p mus(e)
φR

(4.3.3)

With no airflow, mouth pressure is assumed to equal alveolar pressure.
It is interesting to speculate about a connection between the irregular carotid body afferent discharge and the irregular phrenic
nerve efferent discharge. If the second is a direct result of the first, it could be a "dithering," or slight variation, about the mean
control point, resulting in faster response and relying on sufficient inertia by the body CO2 stores to absorb small CO2
variations.

Coefficient values were obtained from the literature: ηNi was chosen to give a peak
isometric pressure of 1470 N/m2 (15.0 cm H2O) with a neural input of 15.0 arbitrary units (η =
98.03 N/m2/arbitrary unit). Compliance C was taken to be 1.3 x 10-6 m5/N (0.13 L/cm H2O)
and two values of resistance R used were 196 kN·sec/m5 (2.0 cm H2O·sec/L) and 588
kN·sec/m5. The muscle length–tension effects represent the difference between passive

stimulation. The value for v thus becomes 5.4 x 105 N/m5 (5.4 cm H2O/L). Although taken to
be a constant, the actual value of v probably varies with level of inspiratory activity (Younes
and Remmers, 1981). The value for muscle force–velocity effect φ is taken from human
subject data at a lung volume close to FRC. Its value is 573 kN·sec/m5 (5.85 cm H2O·sec/L),
and, again, it would probably be more correct not assumed constant.
Younes and Remmers (1981) report that inspiration, as determined by flow rate, is
different from inspiration from a neural standpoint. Inspiratory flow rate is delayed from the
onset of neural output if beginning lung volume is above resting lung volume: expiration
continues until the neural output overcomes opposite elastic tendencies. If beginning lung
volume is below resting lung volume, then inspiratory flow may precede neural output. The
amount of delay or anticipation depends on the rate of rise of the neural output as well as
resistance and compliance of the respiratory system.
The end of inspiratory flow is always delayed beyond the peak of neural output. The
extent of delay depends on rate of decline of neural output and respiratory resistance and
compliance (Younes and Remmers, 1981). Changes in the shape with time of the neural
output can overcome large increases in respiratory resistance and compliance.
Inspiratory duration appears to be determined by the respiratory controller. Although the
exact mechanism of inhalation time control is unknown, it appears that inhalation can be
ended abruptly in a manner similar to a switch (Younes and Remmers, 1981). This switch
appears to have a variable threshold to such input factors as lung volume, chest wall motion,
blood gases, muscular exercise, body temperature, sleep, disease, and drugs. Figure 4.3.13

Figure 4.3.13 Relation between intensity of inspiratory terminating influences and inspiratory duration in
the cat. As each stimulus (clockwise from upper right: lung volume, electrical stimulus to the rostral
pons, electrical stimulus to the intercostal nerves, and body temperature) increases in magnitude,
inspiratory time shortens. Conversely, as inspiratory time accumulates, a lower stimulus is necessary to
halt inspiration. No lung volume feedback was present for voltage and temperature stimuli. (Adapted and
used with permission from Younes and Remmers, 1981.)


236

shows that the threshold to terminate inspiration decreases with inspiratory time. For instance,
the longer inspiration progresses, the smaller the lung volume must be in order to conclude
inspiration. Sustained lung volume changes have little or no effect (Younes and Remmers,
1981).
Similarly, electrical stimuli to intercostal nerves will shorten inspiration with a timevarying threshold. It would be expected that this effect would be analogous to the effect
produced by intercostal muscle mechanoreceptors operating naturally within a feedback loop.
It has been reported that airway occlusion, chest wall distortion, and vibration all cause
shortening of inspiration (Younes and Remmers, 1981).
Stimulation of the rostral pons area (in the region of the pneumotaxic: center) of the brain
can decrease inspiratory duration, as can body temperature. Hypercapnia decreases inspiratory
duration, and at least part of this may be due to increased participation of chest wall reflexes
as the result of more vigorous inspiration. Many of the preceding factors seem to interact to
reduce inspiration discontinuance threshold below the level that would exist if several factors
were not present (Younes and Remmers, 1981).
This effect of body temperature on inspiratory time is clearly of importance to an animal
that pants when overheated, like a cat. Although humans are not known to rely on this same
heat loss mechanism, an effect such as this would give rise to a respiratory–thermal exercise
limitation interaction as discussed in Section 1.5.
Control of expiratory time is somewhat different from that of inspiratory time. Unlike
inspiration, which is always actively initiated by muscular action, exhalation is considered to
be passive at rest and active during exercise. Control of expiration appears to differ, therefore,
in the dependence of expiratory duration on the previous inspiratory time, and in the active
control of expiratory flow by respiratory resistance regulation (Martin et al., 1982; Younes
and Remmers, 1981).
The transition from exhalation to inhalation also exhibits switching behavior with
variable threshold (Figure 4.3.14).65 The switch characteristic can be determined by stimulus
of the rostral pons area (nucleus parabrachialis medialis) and by chemical stimulation of the
carotid bodies. Subthreshold stimuli cause a translocation of the stimulus–time characteristic
toward the left (Younes and Remmers, 1981). Because of this, repetitive subthreshold stimuli
can have a cumulative effect and change the overall shape of the stimulus–time switching
characteristic. Hence static lung volume changes (as stimuli) do affect the exhalation
switching characteristic (Figure 4.3.15), unlike the inhalation switch where static lung volume
did not affect inhalation time (Younes and Remmers, 1981).
Exhalation time is essentially linked to the preceding inhalation time (Grunstein et al.,
1973; Younes and Remmers, 1981). Evidence shows a central neural linkage between these
two times, which probably acts through the central expiratory excitation threshold illustrated
in Figure 4.3.14.
Since expiratory time and lung volume are interrelated, it should not be surprising to note
that expiratory reserve volume (ERV; see Section 4.2.2) also appears to be under respiratory
control. An increase in exhalation time would be expected to increase ERV because of the
curve in Figure 4.3.15. Changes in ERV are minimized by active resistance changes, to be
discussed later, but decreases in ERV have been reported in humans with hypercapnia
(Younes and Remmers, 1981).
Evidence from cats indicates that an important expiratory flow rate–regulating
mechanism, called expiratory braking, is due to contraction of the inspiratory musculature
during exhalation and due to active regulation of upper airway resistance (Younes and
Remmers, 1981). The role of each of these in humans is not clear, but it is likely that
expiratory braking does occur,66 probably by inspiratory muscular action. Vagal discharge to
upper airway muscles causes changes in glottal opening. Rapid changes in resistance, as

Although this evidence was obtained from resting animals, there is no reason to believe it is not true during exercise.
For instance, there appears to be an optimal resistance to exhalation in humans, and switching from nose breathing at rest to
mouth breathing during exercise occurs when nasal resistance exceeds mouth resistance.

through opening and closing of a tracheostomy tube, result in rapid and continuous changes in
generated muscle pressure. Expiratory flow rate thus appears to have a regulated level.
Hypercapnia seems to decrease expiratory braking.
Control Signals. Most models to be considered later use as the controlled variable a level of
some chemical component such as arterial or venous pCO2.Yamamoto (1960) has suggested,
however, that the magnitude of oscillations of pCO2 throughout the respiratory cycle may be
involved in respiratory control. We have seen that there are discernible oscillations in blood
gas levels during respiration (Section 4.2.2) and that peripheral chemoreceptor outputs follow
these oscillations (Section 4.3.1). We have also noted that cardiovascular control is influenced
by pulse pressure (Section 3.3.1). It would therefore not be surprising if respiratory-produced
blood gas fluctuations had a role in respiratory regulation. Because this fluctuation would
dampen more severely by mixing as distance from the pulmonary circulation increases, it is
suggested that it is detected by peripheral chemoreceptors (Jacquez, 1979).
Some authors have suggested that, instead of the excursion of the oscillation, the
meaningful input is the derivative, or rate of change, of arterial pCO2.
4.3.3

Effector Organs

Many actions are associated with respiration, and there are interfaces between things internal
to the body and external, between cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and between
various and often contradictory functions such as swallowing, smelling, and breathing. It is no
wonder, then, that respiratory regulation is so complex and deals with so many effector
organs.
Respiratory Muscles. The most obvious effector organs are the respiratory muscles,
consisting of the diaphragm and external intercostals for inspiration and the abdominals and
internal intercostals for expiration. These muscles are responsible for causing the rhythmic
mechanical movement of air. Respiratory function of these muscles is superimposed on their
functioning to maintain correct posture of the thoracic cage.
Respiratory muscles, like all other skeletal muscles, react by contraction to a neural input
discharge. In general, the force of contraction varies with degree of neural input (both firing
rate and number of fibers firing). However, the degree of reaction varies with geometrical
configuration of the muscles. There is a length–tension relationship, whereby force generated
by the contracting muscle is directly related to its length: the longer the respiratory muscle, the
greater the force that can be produced (see Section 5.2.5). Thus the smaller the thoracic
volume, the more vigorous is the inspiratory drive. There is also a force–velocity relationship,
whereby contractile force is maximum when the velocity of shortening of the muscle is zero
(see Section 5.2.5). At any given lung volume the generated inspiratory pressure is greatest for
the lowest inspiratory flow rate. It is clear, then, that inspiratory and expiratory muscle
pressures are not simple translations of neural output.
Inspiratory muscles, which actively pull against the force of expiration, and expiratory
muscles, which pull against inspiration, help to stabilize respiratory control and can be
important in expiratory braking. It frequently happens during respiration that muscles are
pulled by other muscles against their developed forces. When a muscle length is increasing
while it is actively developing a force tending to shorten itself, the muscle is said to be
developing negative work (see Section 5.2.5). All of the energy expended by a muscle
undergoing negative work becomes heat.
Airway Muscles. Airway muscles must be coordinated in their actions with the major
respiratory muscles in order to perform the actions of swallowing, sneezing, coughing, and
smelling. The muscles of the pharynx are used to prevent the passage of food and gastric
materials into the lungs (Comroe, 1965). When specific chemical irritants pass below the
larynx, there is a pulmonary chemoreflex consisting of apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension


239

often followed by a cough (Comroe, 1965). Bronchoconstriction also occurs in response to
chemical irritants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), high levels of carbon dioxide
(CO2), inert dusts, and smokes. The degree of response adapts rapidly to repeated stimuli and
becomes weaker with age (Comroe, 1965). Smoking a cigarette induces an immediate twofold
to threefold increase in airway resistance which lasts from 10 to 30 minutes (Comroe, 1965).
Local Effectors. Many other local effector organs are used to deal with specific respiratory
problems and operate within the overall context of respiratory control and coordination. We
have already mentioned the reflex control of ventilation and perfusion in local areas of the
lung (see Section 4.2.2). There is also a local control of mucus secretion and movement of
cilia to remove dust particles from the lower reaches of the lung and move them toward the
throat, where they can be swallowed.67
4.3.4

Exercise

Although a great deal of research has been performed investigating the nature of ventilatory
responses to exercise, at this time there is no final explanation for experimental observations.
This is not due to a lack of ingenious or elegant experiments; enough of these appear to have
been performed to possibly elucidate respiratory controller details [see especially the results of
Kao (1963) and Casaburi et al. (1977)]. Rather, the difficulty appears to lie in the complex
nature of respiratory control and the multitude of possible inputs and outputs. Because of
these, details of respiratory responses are difficult to reproduce, and there appear to be
significant influences of the degree of sophistication of the subjects, prior work history, ages
of the subjects, and individual variation (Briscoe and DuBois, 1958; Whipp, 1981). Responses
to be described in this section are, therefore, to be considered to be responses of normal,
healthy, young adult males, with cautious application to any one particular individual.
Application of these ideas to young females can probably be made without much reservation
-fine details may vary-and application to older adults must take into account changes of
mechanical properties and responsiveness that occur with age (Berger et al., 1977).
A schematic representation of the ventilatory response with time during exercise appears

Figure 4.3.16 Schematic representation of the ventilatory response to exercise. The immediate rise is
probably due to muscular stimulation, and the plateau value will depend on the level of exercise. When
exercise stops, the immediate fall probably indicates that the muscles have ceased moving. Residual
carbon dioxide production keeps ventilation above resting levels at least until the oxygen debt is repaid.
67
To be sure that the upper airway cilia are not overwhelmed by the larger amounts of mucus received from the lower airways,
upper airway cilia beat (move repetitively) at a higher frequency than lower airway cilia (Iravani and Melville, 1976).


240

in Figure 4.3.16. Immediately after the onset of exercise there is a sudden rise of minute
volume, followed by a slower rise to some steady-state value. When exercise ceases, there is
an abrupt fall in minute volume, followed by a recovery period.
Initial Rise. The immediate rise is thought by most researchers to be neurogenic (Tobin et
al., 1986), possibly arising from the exercising muscles themselves (Adams et al., 1984) and
possibly involving the rapid transient increase in blood flow (Weiler–Ravell et al., 1983).
There are several reasons for this view: first, the response occurs too abruptly to allow for the
carriage of metabolites from exercising muscles to known chemoreceptor sites; and, second,
passive stimulation of the muscles will also induce hyperpnea. There is typically no change
seen in end-tidal CO2 (and, by inference, no change in arterial pCO2 or pH) or respiratory
exchange ratio (R) at the onset of exercise. Yet there is a sudden and significant rise in
ventilation, the magnitude of which has been found to sometimes, but not always, depend on
the severity of exercise (Miyamoto et al., 1981; Whipp, 1981). Passive limb movement (limbs
moved by other than the muscles of the person himself) will also result in this immediate
ventilatory response (Jacquez, 1979).
There has been no convincing confirmation of the muscular sensors or neural pathways
that induce this immediate rise. Also, for work increments imposed on prior work, no
additional abrupt change is observed; that is, the sudden hyperpnea occurs only upon the
transition from rest to exercise despite the fact that, when it occurs, its magnitude appears to
vary with exercise level. Also, this immediate hyperpnea can be abolished by prior
hyperventilation (Whipp, 1981). Nevertheless, it is generally conceded that muscular
movement induces an immediate exercise hyperpnea that remains constant for 15–20 seconds
after the onset of exercise.68 Sudden cessation of exercise is accompanied by a similar abrupt
fall in ventilation.
Transient Increase. Following the first phase of exercise response, there is an exponential
increase in ventilation toward a new, higher level, which occurs with a time constant of 65–75
sec (Whipp, 1981). There is a very similar time constant for carbon dioxide production, as
measured at the mouth. The time constant for oxygen uptake, however, is only about 45 sec
(Whipp, 1981). Thus there appears to be a much higher correlation between VDCO 2 and VDE
than between VDO and VDE . This implies the importance of carbon dioxide in respiratory
2

control.
Whipp (1981) notes, however, that VDCO 2 as measured at the mouth, differs considerably
as produced by the muscles. There is a large capacity for CO2 storage in the
from VD
CO 2

muscles and blood.69 Thus the high correlation between VDE and VDCO 2 involves CO2 delivery
to the lungs and not CO2 production by exercising muscles. Carotid body function is essential
for this close association to take place.
Figure 4.3.17 shows measured responses to sinusoidally varying exercise level in a
healthy subject. Minute volume, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, and end-tidal CO2
partial pressure (and pCO2) all show sinusoidal variations. Minute volume is highest when
arterial pCO2 is the highest, but the ratio between VDE and VDCO 2 does not remain constant and
can be seen to decrease when VDE increases. The reason for this is that VE is not zero when
VCO is zero; thus the effect of the initial constant value for VDE is made smaller as VDE
2

increases.
Whipp (1981) unequivocally states that the transient increase in ventilation appears to
have a first-order linear response. That is, the increase in minute volume obeys the
characteristic differential equation

τ

dVCE
+ VCE = 0
d (t − t d )

(4.3.5)

68
See Saunders (1980) for an alternative explanation of the immediate ventilatory rise based on the time rate of change of CO2 at
the carotid bodies. An increase in heart rate at the beginning of exercise changes this rate of rise almost immediately.
69
There is very little oxygen storage capacity compared to oxygen needs.

where τ = time constant of the response, sec
td = delay time, sec
The value for τ, as mentioned before, is about 65–75 sec. The solution to Equation 4.3.5 will
be found from both complementary and particular solutions. For instance, if, at the beginning
of time, a step change in work rate is incurred, the solution to Equation 4.3.570 is

VDE = (VDE∞ −VDEo ) (1− e − (t − t d ) /τ )

(4.3.6)

where VDE∞ = steady-state minute volume after the step change, m3/sec

VDEo = steady-state minute volume before the step change, m3/sec
Jacquez (1979) cites evidence that the transient response to increasing concentrations of
CO2 in the inspired breath does not appear to come from a linear system (Figure 4.3.18). As
the magnitude of the steady-state response increases, so does the time constant (Table 4.3.1).
Steady State. If the work rate performed is not too high (less than the anaerobic threshold),
a steady state is finally reached wherein minute volume does not change appreciably.

inhaled O2, and blood pH are seen in Figure 4.3.19. Since normal percentages of carbon
dioxide in the exhaled breath are 4.2–4.5% (Tables 4.2.7 and 4.2.8), the large increase in
minute volume with carbon dioxide increase occurs at percentages very close to normal
values. On the other hand, the range of percentage of oxygen in the exhaled and inhaled air is
15–21%, but minute volume does not begin to respond to oxygen lack until the 6–8% level.
Therefore, carbon dioxide appears to be a much more potent stimulus for respiratory
adjustments than is oxygen.
One reason for this may be the dramatically adverse psychophysiological effects of
increased atmospheric carbon dioxide content (Figure 4.3,2). As little as 2–4% can cause
measurable changes in perception, and 20–30% CO2 in the inhaled gas can cause coma
(Jacquez, 1979). Oxygen concentration of inhaled air would have to be reduced to 10% or less
for any noticeable effect, and normally the only feeling that is described is one of euphoria.
Opinion on the driving input for ventilatory response has been divided for a number of
years. Jacquez (1979) summarized experimental data which relate minute volume to alveolar


243

blood pH levels, and decreasing oxygen levels. The response to carbon dioxide is linear over a wide
range beyond the threshold value of 3.5%. Above 10% CO2 the respiratory system can no longer
compensate by increased ventilation. Responses to pH and O2 are, in general, smaller and nonlinear.

partial pressure of carbon dioxide (arterial pCO2 is strongly related). Whipp (1981) maintains,
however, that the true driving input is carbon dioxide evolution at the lungs, not arterial pCO2.
We will return to Whipp's formulation after a while. Both authors agree that there is a linear
relationship between VDE and either arterial pCO2 or VDCO 2 for the normal control range above
some threshold value and below an upper extreme. To be clearer about this, we note that slope
of the response graph relating VDE to some measure of carbon dioxide production is linear, but
the value of the ratio between VD and the carbon dioxide measure diminishes because of the
E

initial value for VDE .
Figures 4.3.20 and 4.3.21 show this linear relationship between alveolar partial pressure
of CO2 and minute volume. Above a threshold value called the "dog-leg," or "hockey-stick,"
portion, ventilation is seen to be a linear function of arterial pCO2.71 The family of curves
results from different values of arterial pO2. Since the slopes of these curves change, the
interaction between carbon dioxide and oxygen appears to be multiplicative. Within a small
amount of error, all curves above the dog-leg intersect the abscissa at a common point.
Jacquez (1979) presents the form for carbon dioxide control of ventilation above the dog-leg

upward, may no longer be linear, may have slopes less than those of the curves at rest, and show no sign of a dog-leg.

oxygen. In this plot is shown the abrupt change in sensitivity that occurs at some threshold value called
the dog-leg. (Adapted and used with permission from Nielsen and Smith, 1952.)

Changes in blood pH also affect minute ventilation, and, because of the relation between
pCO2 and pH (Equation 3.2.3), pH effects are difficult to separate from CO2 effects.
Somewhat slower transient response of ventilation to pH compared to pCO2 indicates that pH
effects are not identical to pCO2 effects (Jacquez, 1979). This is not surprising in view of the
chemoreceptor mechanisms discussed earlier (Section 4.3.1).
If a steady-state response is reached, Cunningham et al. (1961) showed that the
ventilatory response to pCO2 in ammonium chloride acidosis is shifted toward increased
alveolar pCO2 with no significant change in slope. In metabolic acidosis,72 they concluded,
there is only a minor change in the parameters α, κ, γ in Equation 4.3.7 but the parameter β
72
Metabolic acidosis occurs whenever blood pH is lowered by natural metabolic or pathogenic means. Inhaling air enriched in
CO2 produces metabolic acidosis; blood bicarbonate movement to replace chloride lost in vomiting produces metabolic
acidosis; metabolizing large quantities of protein containing sulfur (metabolized into sulfuric acid) produces metabolic acidosis;
excessive ketone production during lipolysis and fatty acid liberation in diabetes can produce metabolic acidosis: incomplete
oxidation of glycogen into lactic acid causes metabolic acidosis.

the effects of CO2 and pH are additive (Jacquez, 1979).
One main difficulty with Equation 4.3.7 is that it does not predict the ventilatory response
to exercise (Jacquez, 1979). In fact, the response to increased carbon dioxide in the blood
caused as a result of metabolism is an almost imperceptible change in arterial pCO2 but a large

Figure 4.3.22 The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide depends on its source. Inhaled CO2 causes an
increase in ventilation with a concomitant increases in arterial partial pressure of CO2. Metabolic CO2
produced within the working muscles results in an isocapnic increase of ventilation. The difference
between these two sources of CO2 may be due to the remoteness of the CO2 respiratory sensor.

increase in ventilation. The response to inhaled carbon dioxide is a much larger change in
arterial pCO2 and a smaller increase in ventilation (Figure 4.3.22). Swanson (1979) gives a
possible controller equation for ventilation as

paCO2 = arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, N/m2
K1, K2, K3 = coefficients, m5/(N·sec), unitless, and m3/sec, respectively
The first term related to arterial pCO2 is a feedback term, which indicates to the system that
ideal levels have not been maintained and that ventilation must be increased proportionately to
the error which appears in paCO2. The second term is a feedforward term which indicates to
the system that a ventilatory adjustment must be made to anticipate future changes in paCO2
(see also Section 2.4.2 for further discussion of feedback and feedforward control applied to
stepping motion). The K2 coefficient must be very much larger than K1 if the situation
illustrated in Figure 4.3.22 is to hold true. During exercise, there are both an increased level of
metabolic CO2 and an increased level of inhaled CO2 due to respiratory dead volume.
Below the dog-leg, carbon dioxide sensitivity is drastically reduced. The reason for this is
not now known, but several hypotheses have been offered (Jacquez, 1979). One possibility
involves the estimate that 80% of the CO2 response results from central receptors and the
remaining 20% from peripheral receptors. It may be that below the dog-leg, central receptors
are not contributing to CO2 response. Anot6r possibility is that the low arterial pCO2 below
the dog-leg causes constriction of the cerebral blood vessels so that local cerebral pCO2
depends on local CO2 production and not on arterial pCO2.
Similarly, the interaction between hypercapnia and hypoxia illustrated in Figure 4.3.20
has been postulated to arise in peripheral chemoreceptors (Cunningham, 1974). Outputs from
these receptors then sum with outputs from central receptors in the final determination of


247

(4.3.12)

Whipp (1981) argues strongly for considering minute ventilation to be related to carbon
dioxide production74 rather than to arterial pCO2. Any change in arterial pCO2 "is a
consequence of the ventilatory change, not the cause of it." Mean arterial pCO2 and H+ during
moderate exercise are typically unchanged from control values; therefore, there must be a
different control mechanism in this instance compared to CO2 inhalation studies where arterial
pCO2 and H+ increase (Whipp, 1981).
Most investigators have indicated that arterial pCO2 does not change during exercise
from its normal value of 5.33 kN/m2 (40 mm Hg; Comroe, 1965). Berger et al. (1977),
however, report on a study that shows small but measurable increases in pCO2 accompanied
74
Whipp (1981) reviews evidence that the type of metabolized food is important in determining ventilation. When fats are
metabolized, with a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.7, about 7 molecules of CO2 are produced for every 10 molecules of O2
utilized. When carbohydrates are used, R = 1.0, and 10 molecules of CO2 are produced for each 10 molecules of O2 utilized.
The CO2 output is considerably higher for a given metabolic load when carbohydrates are the predominant fuel source. It has
been demonstrated that minute volume is proportionately higher for larger proportions of carbohydrate metabolized.


248

by increased oxygen uptake. Martin et al. (1978) and Filley et al. (1978) suggest an increased
sensitivity to pCO2 during exercise. Mahler (1979) presents the view that muscular exercise
and other neural influences shift the intercept of the CO2 response curve without shifting the
slope. Therefore, the basic control of ventilation during exercise is through these shifts in CO2
sensitivity.
Response to severe oxygen lack is difficult to elicit from humans without changes in
ventilation, which, in turn, decrease arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. When care is
taken to assure constant arterial pCO2, curves similar to those in Figure 4.3.23 result. For
constant alveolar pCO2, the ventilatory response is nonlinear and shows the multiplicative
interaction discussed earlier. When plotted against arterial hemoglobin saturation percentage,
minute ventilation response curves become linear (Figure 4.3.24).
Oxygen sensitivity is wholly a result of peripheral chemoreceptors. From the instant a
subject is given a breath of pure oxygen, a decrease in ventilation is seen after a short delay of
about 5 sec (3.45–10.5 sec for different individuals, longer delays for older subjects; Jacquez,
1979). This is equivalent to 0.83–3.89 respiratory cycles and is the appropriate amount of time
for the circulating blood to reach the peripheral chemoreceptors. Maximum response occurs
after 10–20 sec.
Hypoxic sensitivity is somewhat more variable than hypercapnic sensitivity in normal
subjects (Berger et al., 1974). The change in respiratory minute volume can be expressed as

paO2 = arterial partial pressure of oxygen, N/m2
α = constant, N·m/sec
γ = threshold value, N/m2 (see Equation 4.3.7)
The value for γ is approximately 4.27 kN/m2 (or 32 mm Hg; Cunningham, 1974) and the value
for α has been found to range from 0.153 to 0.911 N·m/sec (69–410 mm Hg·L/min) with an
average value of 0.400 N·m/sec (Berger et al., 1974). Martin et al. (1978) found an almost
tenfold increase in the value of α between rest and exercise.
Although minute volume is not a linear function of oxygen partial pressure, it is often
considered to be linearly related to oxygen uptake below the anaerobic threshold (Figure
4.3.24). Arterial pCO2 is not maintained at set levels during these exercise tests.
Other inputs have been found to influence the steady-state level of ventilation. Ammonia
has been found to produce hyperventilation, and significant amounts of ammonia are found in
the blood during exercise and some pathological states (Jacquez, 1979). Body temperature,
which increases during exercise, is known to affect ventilation mainly through an increase in
sensitivity to alveolar pCO2 (Jacquez, 1979; Whipp, 1981). This increased sensitivity appears
as an increase in parameter κ in Equation 4.3.7.
Emotion and stress can induce hyperpnea. Increased catecholamine concentrations, which
often accompany high levels of emotion, have been shown to increase ventilation by
increasing hypoxic sensitivity. In Equation 4.3.7, the effect is seen mainly in a change in
parameter α (Whipp, 1981).
Sleep, high blood pressure, anesthetics, and some drugs decrease ventilation levels
(Jacquez, 1979; Whipp, 1981). Other drugs, such as aspirin, increase CO2 sensitivity and thus
increase ventilation (Jacquez, 1979).
Acclimatization can modify ventilatory responses to CO2, O2, and pH. Figure 4.3.25

presents carbon dioxide sensitivity curves as they change over the course of eight days at 3800
m altitude (hypoxic conditions). It is also known that patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) usually exhibit abnormally low carbon dioxide sensitivities
(Anthonisen and Cherniack, 1981), but there is a question whether existing low CO2
sensitivity predisposes humans to suffer from COPD (Forster and Dempsey, 1981). Age
appears to decrease CO2 sensitivity (Altose et al., 1977) and the practice of yoga breathing
exercise has also been found to reduce CO2 sensitivity (Stǎnescu et al., 1981).
Cessation of Exercise. When exercise ceases, there is often an immediate fall in minute
ventilation (Figure 4.3.16), although this may be masked by a long, gradual decline.
Ventilation rates remain elevated because carbon dioxide and lactate are not removed
immediately from the blood (see Section 1.3.3). For subjects recovering from maximal
exercise (90–100% VDO2 max ), breathing is typically more rapid and shallow than for lower
exercise rates. Younes and Burks (1985) attribute this to pulmonary interstitial edema (fluid in
the lung tissue) occurring only at very severe exercise rates, but Martin et al. (1979) assert that
the rise in rectal temperature associated with exercise reduces tidal volume compared to its
value without heating.
Anaerobic Ventilation. During very heavy exercise there is an additional respiratory drive
caused by increased blood lactate (see Section 1.3.5).75 Incomplete oxidation of glucose
results in lactic acid, which then produces increased arterial pCO2 through the buffering
reaction:
H+ + La– + Na+ + HCO 3− ⇐⇒ Na+ + La– + H2CO3 ⇐⇒ Na+ + La– + CO2 + H2O
(4.3.14)
where La– = lactate anion = CH3·CHOH·COO–
Bicarbonate levels are reduced and carbon dioxide production is increased beyond that
75

Cunningham (1974) reports negligible steady-state changes in blood lactate at work intensities below 60–75% of aerobic

capacity (60–75% of VDO max ), but lactate concentration increases more than tenfold in severe exercise. In mild exercise,
2
blood lactate concentrations increase transiently and reach a significant peak 5–10 min after the start.

predicted by the respiratory quotient (see Section 3.2.2).76 During this phase, the respiratory
exchange ratio will exceed the respiratory quotient.
There is a narrow range of work rates over which nearly complete ventilatory
compensation can be made for the increased levels of CO2 produced (Figure 4.3.26). The
relationship between oxygen uptake and work rate will still appear to be linear, but the
relationship between minute volume and oxygen uptake will become nonlinear in this region.
If a steady state can be reached, end-tidal pCO2, decreases, but the blood pH level appears to
be regulated at its previous normal value. At even higher work rates (see Section 1.3.5),
ventilation increases ever more rapidly, arterial pCO2 falls even more, and blood pH declines
(Whipp, 1981). This condition cannot be maintained.
Kinetics of this process are very poorly understood. Aside from the practical problems of
pushing test subjects to their limits to obtain meaningful data, many aspects of the problem
cannot be easily measured. With a reduction in arterial pCO2, one would expect, on the basis
of information in Figure 4.3.20, that a decrease in ventilation would result. Instead, minute
volume appears to be related to the rate of CO2 evolution. In addition, the blood-brain barrier
is much more permeable to CO2 relative to H+ and HCO3-. Therefore, while the peripheral
chemoreceptors are reacting to increased blood H+ (metabolic acidosis) and carbon dioxide
production, the cerebrospinal fluid (and thus fluid surrounding the central chemoreceptors)
becomes alkaline. These conditions are sure to produce conflicting regulatory tendencies.
76
Approximately 4 x 10-7 m3 (400 mL) of CO2 is produced as a result of a decrease of 61 g/m3 (1 meq/L) of HCO3- in the
extracellular fluid (Whipp, 1981).


252

Figure 4.3.27 Respiratory measures with progressive work rate. Minute volume increases linearly with
work rate up to the anaerobic threshold, when it begins increasing disproportionately. Tidal volume can
be seen to reach a limit after the anaerobic threshold, but respiration rate increases greatly. (Adapted and
used with permission from Martin and Weil, 1979.)

If work rate increases at a rate too high for equilibrium to be established, blood pH no
longer appears to be regulated but instead falls (Whipp, 1981). Respiration is much less
efficient, and the respiratory muscles begin to require much more oxygen to perform the work
of breathing than they require below the anaerobic threshold. It has been reported that at a
ventilation rate of 0.0023m3/sec (140 L/min) a small increase in ventilation requires an
increment of oxygen utilization greater than that which can be provided by the increase in
ventilation (Abbrecht, 1973). Figure 4.3.27 illustrates another interesting facet: below the
anaerobic threshold, increased minute volume comes as a result mainly of tidal volume
increase; above the anaerobic threshold, tidal volume remains nearly constant, and the
increase of minute volume is supplied by an increase in respiration rate.
Ventilatory Loading. It has been stated, and commonly assumed, that exercise performance is
not limited by respiration in healthy subjects (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). The same cannot be
said for humans suffering the effects of respiratory disease, or those who are wearing


253

respiratory apparatus for protection or testing. The addition of various mechanical devices,
such as masks or J-valves, can have severe consequences on respiratory responses and
exercise performance.
Various types of ventilatory loads can be applied. The first is resistive: adding elements
to the respiratory pathways which increase resistance in ways similar to airways, lung tissue,
and chest wall resistance. Breathing through contaminant filters, tubes of small diameter,
perforated disks, or screens, breathing during bronchoconstriction, and breathing gases of high
density or viscosity (Cherniack and Altose, 1981)—all increase resistance loading.
Elastic loading changes pressure–volume relationships of breathing. Examples of this are
breathing from rigid containers, during chest strapping, or with a pneumothorax or
atelectasis.77 For both of these, higher pressures are required of the respiratory muscles in
order to inhale or expel any given volume.
Pressure loading involves the application of gas which opposes inspiration or expiration.
This can be accomplished by breathing from pressurized cylinders of gas and is frequently
found in positive pressurized, air- (or oxygen-) supplied masks.
Threshold loads prevent flow at the beginning of inspiration or expiration until a
threshold pressure is exceeded (Cherniack and Altose, 1981). Examples of this type of loading
occur when breathing through a tube inserted to a fixed depth underwater, or when wearing a
pressure-demand respirator mask.
Many of these ventilated loads can be externally applied. Usually, some amount of dead
volume is applied simultaneously.
When ventilatory loading is applied to a human, several compensatory mechanisms can
operate. The first of these are the various mechanical properties of the chest wall and muscles
themselves. The muscles can intrinsically increase their forces as their resting lengths are
increased (see Section 5.2.5). Because the diaphragm is dome shaped, increasing resting
volume shortens inspiratory muscle resting length and decreases the inspiratory force that can
be produced. Increasing resting volume has exactly the opposite effect on the expiratory
muscles—expiratory forces are increased. The elastic nature of the chest wall and lung tissue
also aids expiration and hinders inspiration as the resting volume is increased. Some
respiratory response to ventilatory loading would thus be expected to be a change in resting
volume of the lungs. Posture affects the size and shape of the respiratory muscles, and thus
affects load compensation.
Ventilatory loading that reduces the velocity of shortening of the muscles can increase
the forces produced by those muscles, which serves to maintain tidal volume.78 Respiration
rate falls and minute volume also falls.
Another compensatory mechanism deals with the neural input to the muscles of the chest,
abdomen, and respiratory airways. These inputs arise from chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors
(mainly stretch receptors in the lung and chest), and from higher centers in the brain. With
these diverse inputs, the response to ventilatory loading becomes very complex.
For example, hypoxia or hypercapnia leads to an increased output from chemoreceptors.
This tends to shorten exhalation time, which induces an increased resting volume. Laryngeal
resistance decreases, however, and postinspiratory braking of the diaphragm diminishes,
tending to preserve the normal level of resting volume (Cherniack and Altose, 1981).
Without pulmonary mechanoreceptor input, stimulation of the chemoreceptors increases
tidal volume without change in inspiratory time. With pulmonary mechanoreceptor input, tidal
volume changes are inversely proportional to changes in the inspiratory time (Cherniack and
Altose, 1980). In general, elastic loads decrease tidal volume and increase the respiration rate,
due mostly to an increase in neuronal discharge to the inspiratory muscles. During exercise,
77
A pneumothorax occurs whenever air is introduced between the lung and pleura, or between the pleura and thoracic wall.
Since tissue-to-tissue contact is no longer present, the affected lung may partially or fully collapse. Atelectasis refers to an
airless state of the interior of a part or all of the lung. Air is often replaced by fluid.
78
As exercise progresses, higher respiratory flow rates increase airways resistance. Lind (1984) states that a higher respiratory
muscle pressure is automatically applied to overcome this increased resistance.


254

elastic loads decrease the vital capacity and decrease the maximum tidal volume (see Figure
4.3.26) which is reached. Respiration rate increases above that of the unloaded condition.
Elastic loads can be perceived by humans, although not as readily as resistive loads. Changes
on the order of 10–25% are readily detected (Cherniack and Altose, 1981).
Resistive loads generally increase inhalation time and/or exhalation time and decrease
flow rate. Inspiratory loading increases inhalation time, decreases respiration rate, and lowers
minute volume. The duration of the succeeding exhalation is influenced by the prior
inhalation, longer inspiratory times leading to long expiratory times (Cherniack and Altose,
1981). Expiratory resistance loading increases the exhalation time and reduces expiratory flow
rate without influencing the next inspiration. Resistance loading during exercise does not
decrease the maximum tidal volume reached during exercise (see Figure 4.3.26) but does limit
the respiration rate.
The ability to detect increases in resistance depends on the prior level of airway
resistance. Burki et al. (1978) and Gottfried et al. (1978) concluded that the minimum
detectable external resistance is always a constant proportion (25–30%) of the resistance
already present.79 Since the level of resistance present in the airways of those with respiratory
disease, and in the old (Campbell and Lefrak, 1978), is higher than in young, healthy adults,
the inability to detect small changes in added resistance may be a valid reason why ventilatory
compensation for resistance loads is less complete in these individuals (Cherniack and Altose,
1981; Rubin et al., 1982).
The detection of resistive loads has been found to be impaired by elastic loading (Shahid
et al., 1981; Zechman et al., 1981), the minimum detectable difference of resistive loads being
a fixed proportion of both resistive and elastic loading. Detection of elastic loads does not
appear to depend at all on resistive loads present.
Ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are reduced during resistive loading.
The more severe the resistive load, the greater is the fall in minute volume (Cherniack and
Altose, 1981). Increasing the percentage of CO2 in the inhaled air increases inspiratory time,
whereas increased CO2 in the exhaled air has no effect on inspiratory time and results in an
increase in exhalation time only after a time delay.
Occlusion pressure increases during resistive loading in healthy, normal subjects. It does
not increase in chronic obstructive lung disease patients (Cherniack and Altose, 1981). There
is a limit, however, to the maximum pressures that can be developed even in healthy subjects
(see Table 4.2.21).
Respiratory responses to ventilatory challenges depend on previous experience and
personality traits. Inexperienced subjects increase their abdominal muscle force during
positive pressure breathing to minimize the change in resting volume and maintain the
diaphragm in an optimal mechanical position. Experienced subjects allow their resting
volumes to enlarge and maintain adequate minute volumes despite the mechanical
disadvantage of the diaphragm by increases in the neural drive to inspiration (Cherniack and
Altose, 1981).
Psychometrically identified neurotic individuals tend to breathe more rapidly and
shallowly than normal individuals. Neurotics tend to increase minute volume in response to
expiratory threshold loading more than do normals (Cherniack and Altose, 1981). Anxiety has
been shown to shorten inspiratory and expiratory times as tidal volume increases (Bechbache
et al., 1979). Circulating catecholamine levels normally affect respiration and may influence
the response to loading. Performance of difficult arithmetic tasks has been shown to cause
increases in respiratory resistance (Kotses et al., 1987).
Dyspnea and Second Wind. Dyspnea is difficult, labored, uncomfortable breathing
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Dyspnea can occur during exercise, at rest in humans with
respiratory diseases, or in normals with ventilatory loading. Elements of chest tightness,
79
Katz-Salamon (1984) found that the just-noticeable difference in lung volume was also 25–29% of lung volume present before
the change.


255

awareness of excessive ventilation, excessive frequency of breathing, and difficult breathing
are all present (Campbell and Guz, 1981).
No one knows for sure what causes the sensation of dyspnea (Wasserman and Casaburi,
1988). It appears not to be pain, it is not directly related to work or effort by the respiratory
muscles, nor does respiratory muscle fatigue appear to be a direct cause (Campbell and Guz,
1981).
Respiratory sensation appears to depend on mouth pressure, inspiratory time, and
respiration rate (Jones, 1984):
Ψ = K p1m.4 t i0.52 f 0.26

(4.3.15)

where Ψ = sense of respiratory effort, dimensionless
pm = mouth pressure, N/m2
ti = inspiratory time, sec
f = respiration rate, breaths/sec
K = coefficient, m2.8/(N1.4·sec0.26)
Involved in determination of the coefficient K are respiratory muscle strength and resting lung
volume. Sensation is increased with volume and decreased with strength. Experience seems to
modify the amount of respiratory sensation, and age seems to be accompanied by a change of
sensation based on volume to that based on respiratory muscle force (Tack et al., 1983).
O'Connell and Campbell (1976) studied three groups of subjects (patients with airways
obstruction who complained of dyspnea at rest, a control group of patients with airways
obstruction but no symptoms of dyspnea, and a group of normal subjects). They determined
that normal subjects experiencing dyspnea could be separated from normal subjects
experiencing no dyspnea by forming the ratio of respiratory muscle pressure required to
produce the highest inspiratory flow during breathing p to maximum developed muscle
pressure pmax. When the ratio p/pmax was greater than 0.1, the sensation of dyspnea was felt in
all but two cases (Figure 4.3.28). Likewise, there was a separation between patients with and
without dyspnea at p/pmax ratios of about 0.14. However, there was considerable overlap of the
ratios for normal subjects with dyspnea and the ratios of patients without dyspnea.
This relationship between muscle pressure and dyspnea is consistent with the concept of
the feeling of mechanical appropriateness of the respiratory muscles. This hypothesis suggests
that mechanoreceptors in the lung and chest wall send information to the central nervous
system about the length–tension relationship of the muscles. If too much force must be
developed in the muscles for any particular lung volume, a conscious feeling of labored
breathing results. Higher pressures must be developed when breathing through higher
resistances, into lower compliances, or when breathing at higher than normal lung volumes.
Where this information originates, how it is transmitted, and where it is felt are open to
speculation. The information pathway probably involves the vagus nerve (Campbell and Guz,
1981).80 The actual sensation can be modified by expectations about the load and by anxiety
states (Campbell and Guz, 1981).81
Second wind is the feeling of respiratory relief that is experienced after exercise has
progressed for a short time. Although not everything is known about second wind, it appears
to be the result of time lags in the accommodation to exercise conditions. Although there is an
immediate increase in minute volume when exercise begins, the rise to steady-state levels
80

Mohler (1982) attempted to quantify dyspnea by voice pitch analysis. He found that the fundamental frequency of speaking
during exercise was related to a feeling of dyspnea. The mechanism of this linkage may involve vagal signals to the larynx.
See Section 2.4.2 for a model of stepping with similar concepts. In that model, steps are normally performed with feedforward
programming. Special steps require feedback and more conscious awareness. Breathing could act in a similar way.

does not occur instantaneously (Figure 4.3.16). The relief of this initial hypoventilation may
contribute to second wind Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
The redistribution of blood from the gut and kidneys to the working muscles (Table
3.2.4) may also take some time to develop. It thus appears that the respiratory muscles are
forced to work anaerobically at the beginning of heavy exercise (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
Second wind appears to be strongly related to the temperature of the working muscles
(Morehouse and Miller, 1967). When they have attained their higher temperatures, muscle
metabolism appears to return to a more normal state, efficiency increases, and muscular
demand on the respiratory system diminishes somewhat. This is reflected by a decrease in
respiratory rate and minute volume and a small decrease in oxygen consumption. Second wind
can be delayed by cool environmental temperatures (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
Optimization of Breathing. Respiratory work, which accounts for only 1–2% of the total
body oxygen consumption at rest, may rise to as much as 10% or higher during exercise (see
Table 4.2.20). For moderately exercising patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
the portion of the body's total oxygen consumption used by the respiratory muscles to support
the act of breathing rises to 35–40% (Levison and Cherniack, 1968). Since this is work that


257

Figure 4.3.29 Breathing work rate with different respiration rates. Both elastic (compliance) and
nonelastic (resistance) components comprise total respiratory work rate. Because these components have
opposite trends, total respiratory work rate exhibits a minimum value at one specific frequency. This
leads to the optimization of respiration at the frequency corresponding to the minimum. (Adapted and
used with permission from Otis et al., 1950,)

does not aid primarily the completion of the muscular task being performed during exercise, it
appears reasonable that the neural mechanisms regulating respiration would aim toward
minimizing the work of respiration. Many of the physical adjustments in breathing, as
measured during exercise, appear to be the same adjustments that would be made to minimize
the power expenditure of breathing, or some very similar quantity.82 Adjustments in breathing
airflow pattern, frequency, relative durations of inhalation and exhalation, expiratory reserve
volume, and perhaps airways resistance, dead volume, and compliance appear to be the result
of some integrated neural optimization.
Whereas respiratory ventilation during rest is sometimes subject to a high degree of
voluntary control, this is usually much less true during exercise. One of the most noticeable
changes that occurs happens to respiration rate, which becomes much higher during exercise:
a resting respiration rate of 0.25 breath/sec (15 breaths/min) will normally progress to 0.7
breath/sec (42 breaths/min) during maximal sustained exertion.
There appears to be good reason for his change in respiration rate. Otis et al. (1950) were
among the first to speculate on the basis of the adjustment in respiration rate. To that
speculation they added a simple quantitative analysis based on a criterion of minimization of
average inspiratory power.
Most optimization models are based on the fact that as flow rate increases, dissipation of
power across respiratory resistance increases. However, elastic power, represented by the
amount of power needed to stretch the lungs and chest wall, increases as depth of breathing
increases. To minimize resistive power and still maintain the required minute volume, long,
slow breaths with low flow rates are implied. To minimize elastic power, rapid, shallow
breaths with relatively high flow rates are required. Since these requirements oppose each
other, a minimum should be found between the two extremes. This is illustrated in Figure
82

Kennard and Martin (1984), however, failed to observe any oxygen uptake differences from subjects exercising while
breathing at different frequencies.


258

4.3.29. The frequency corresponding to minimum respiratory work is nearly equal to the
spontaneous frequency of breathing at rest. Christie (1953) showed that the frequency
corresponding to minimum respiratory power increases during exercise, despite the fact that
the actual magnitude of the respiratory power minimum is much higher than nonminimum
values during rest.
Otis et al. (1950) based their modeling on several assumptions:
1. The pattern of breathing is sinusoidal.
2. Breathing occurs at a rate required to minimize the average inspiratory power.
3. Alveolar ventilation rate does not vary with respiratory period.
4. Inertia of tissues and air is neglected.
5. Expiration is passive or at least does not enter into the determination of respiratory
period.
They formulated the expression for inspiratory work as

where Wi = inspiratory work, N·m

Most authors solve their equations in terms of respiratory rate f, which is equal to 1/T. However, solution for the respiratory
period T has advantages in graphical determination of true minima. In graphing respiratory power or force against frequency, a
broad minimum is usually obtained. From the chain rule,

∂WDi ∂WDi ∂f
=
∂f ∂T
∂T

and

∂f
= –1/T2
∂T

Since T is often given in minutes, and T << 1 min,
| –1/T2| >> 1

and

∂WDi
∂WD

∂T
∂f

Therefore, the slope of average respiratory power graphed against T is greater than the slope or power against f, and the
minimum point should be graphically better defined.

Figure 4.3.30 An explanation for the increase in respiration rate during exercise. Although total rate of
respiratory work is higher during exercise than at rest, the minimum point moves to a higher frequency.
(Adapted and used with permission from Christie, 1953.)

No optimal value for T can be found if total cycle work rather than inspiratory work is
used as the optimization parameter. This is because elastic work stored during inspiration is
completely used during expiration. If expiration is not passive, stored elastic work reduces the
amount of exhalation work expended, with a net result of no elastic work term appearing in
total cycle work expression. Without elastic work, there can be no optimal respiratory period.
Recognizing the shortcomings of assuming a sinusoidal waveform, Otis et al. (1950)
indicated that if the actual airflow velocity pattern were known, actual respiratory power could
be calculated. One procedure they suggested is to calculate pressures corresponding to points
on the velocity curve and then obtain work by graphical or numerical solution of Equation
4.3.16. A similar procedure was used by Christie (1953) to produce curves demonstrating that
the observed respiratory frequency increase during exercise is due to a shift in the minimum
average inspiratory work (Figure 4.3.30).
Mead (1960) proposed that, instead of minimizing inspiratory work rate, respiratory
period is controlled by a criterion of minimum average respiratory muscle force. In an
elaborate and thorough paper, he derived an expression for respiratory frequency based on the
force criterion, and he proceeded to demonstrate that most observations were more consistent
with his hypothesis than with the minimum power hypothesis. Mead assumed;
1. The pattern of breathing is sinusoidal.
2. Breathing occurs at a rate required to minimize the average respiratory muscle force.


261

3. Alveolar ventilation rate does not vary with respiratory period.
4. Inertia of tissues and air is neglected.
5. Average force is proportional to the peak-to-peak amplitude of force for the cycle.
6. Nonconsistent resistance and compliance terms are neglected.
Average amplitude of muscle pressure was expressed by Mead as
p mus = VD Z m

(4.3.28)

where p mus = average muscle pressure, N/m2
Z m = amplitude of the mechanical impedance, N·sec/ m5
= [R2 + (T / 2πC)2]1/2
VD = average inspiratory flow rate, m3/sec
= 2πVT /T
Therefore,
p mus =

VT
C

( 2 RC / T ) 2 + 1

(4.3.29)

When tidal volume is substituted by its equivalent alveolar ventilation rate and dead space,
Equation 4.3.29, and the resulting expression for p mus , is differentiated to find the
extremum. Average respiratory period which minimizes pressure amplitude and hence
average muscle force is
T = (2πRC)2/3( VA /VD)–1/3

(4.3.30)

Figure 4.3.31 shows frequency plotted from Equation 4.3.29 as minimum force

Figure 4.3.31 Data on actual respiratory rates match curves computed on the basis of minimum force
amplitude (right) better than curves computed on the basis of minimum work rate (left). These curves

amplitude, and frequency plotted from Equation 4.3.27 as minimum work rate. Plotted as data
points are values of respiratory frequency observed on resting and lightly exercising (up to
102 N·m/sec) humans. As Mead (1960) points out, data values appear to be more consistent
with the force amplitude criterion than the minimum work criterion. Mead also reports that
respiratory time constant measurements on seven resting humans averaged 0.642 sec, which is
extremely close to the time constant isopleth84 of 0.66 sec upon which the data points fell in
the force amplitude graph.
As mentioned earlier, the optimum frequency is not sharply defined. Figure 4.3.32 shows
how broad the minimum is in each case. Because the minimum is so broad, frequency
deviations from the optimum can occur without severe penalty of increased respiratory power
or force amplitude. It is not surprising, then, that considerable breath-to-breath variability is
observed in respiratory period in humans and animals.
Although Mead (1960) has presented considerable evidence that force amplitude, rather
than respiratory power, controls respiratory period, present modeling is based on the latter
criterion. The work by Ruttimann and Yamamoto (1972) showed that force amplitude as a
criterion could not successfully predict airflow waveshape. Yamashiro and Grodins (1971,
1973) demonstrated considerable differences between waveshape and period at rest and
exercise (Figures 4.3.33 and 4.3.34). Despite the fact that no direct evidence has been entered
disclaiming Mead's hypothesis (modeling results excluded), perhaps these points can account

for such large differences between force amplitude and minimum power predictions:
1. It is possible that force amplitude is minimized during rest and respiratory power is
minimized during exercise.
2. Respiratory power predictions may be more sensitive to the assumption of sinusoidal
waveform.
3. Mead's derivation contains a hidden constraint of constant midinspiratory position
(Ruttimann and Yamamoto, 1972), which does not occur in reality.
More recently, in a series of papers Hämäläinen and co-workers (Hämäläinen 1973,
1975; Hämäläinen and Sipilä, 1980; Hämäläinen and Viljanen, 1978a,b,c) outlined a
conceptual mode of the optimal control of the respiratory system and provided a criterion for
optimization which includes elements of minimum force and minimum power.
Hämäläinen's criterion for optimization, called the cost functional or performance
functional in the inhalation direction is
Ji =

∫ [VDD (t ) +α p (t)VD (t)]dt
ti

0

i

i

(4.3.31)

where Ji = inspiratory cost functional, m6/sec3
ti = inhalation time, sec
VDDi (t ) = volume acceleration of the lung, m3/sec2
= rate of change of lung airflow
pi(t) = inspiratory pressure developed by the respiratory muscles, N/m2
VDi (t ) = airflow rate, m3/sec
t = time, sec
αi = weighting parameter, m5/(N·sec3)
and in the exhalation direction is
Je =

∫ [VDD (t ) +α p (t)]dt
ti + te

ti

2
e

e

(4.3.32)

where Je = expiratory cost functional m6/sec3
te = exhalation time, sec
VDDe (t ) = rate of change of airflow during exhalation, m3/sec2
pe(t) = expiratory pressure developed by the respiratory muscles, N/m2
αe = expiratory weighting parameter, m10/N2·sec4
These cost functionals were developed based on some physiological considerations and with
the goal of producing realistic respiratory waveforms.
The inspiratory criterion may be interpreted as the weighted sum of the average square of
volume acceleration and the mechanical work produced by the inspiratory muscles. We have
already discussed optimization based on muscular work, but it should be noted that muscular
work may not be the ideal indicator of muscular load. In Sections 5.2.5 and 3.2.3, we see that
muscular efficiency varies with the velocity of shortening and with the length of the muscle.
Thus external work, as calculated from p(t)V(t), as in Section 4.2.3, is not always a good
indicator of the physiological load that the respiratory muscles represent. As we saw in Table
4.2.20, the oxygen cost of respiratory muscular work increases drastically during exercise.
Oxygen consumption and external mechanical work are related through muscular efficiency,
which varies. There is no clear indication whether the physiological optimization process
operates to minimize mechanical work or oxygen consumption. The distinction between


265

these two is not too important at this stage of our knowledge but may become important later
as models are reconciled to physiological reality.
The average squared volume acceleration in Ji penalizes rapid changes in airflow rate.
Inclusion of this term is based on:
1. The likely reduction in respiratory muscular efficiency with high accelerations
[although Hämäläinen and Viljanen (1978a) indicate that no direct experimental
verification of this effect in respiratory muscles has been reported].
2. The possibility of overstraining and tissue rupture at high accelerations.
3. The possibility of instability and poor control if rapid accelerations were tolerated.
In a later work, Hämäläinen and Sipilä (1980) modified the inspiratory cost functional yet
further by including a term that accounted for the loss of efficiency with muscular load:
J′i =

∫ [VDD (t ) + (1+ β p (t ))(α p (t )VD (t ))]dt
ti

0

i

2

i

i

i

i

i

(4.3.33)

where βi = a constant coefficient, m2/N
The loss of efficiency has been assumed to be linear with muscular load, as represented
by muscular pressure pi(t).
The expiratory cost functional is not the same as the inspiratory cost functional.
Hämäläinen indicates that this is because the inspiratory muscles perform negative work by
opposing expiration at the beginning of expiration. Thus muscular oxygen consumption is not
represented well by the external mechanical work. Because the oxygen cost of negative work
is different from the oxygen cost of positive work, these two types of work cannot be directly
summed, even if absolute values are taken. Hämäläinen thus replaced the mechanical work
term with the mean squared driving pressure as an index of the total cost of breathing.
The parameters αi, αe, and βi, are considered to be individual constants, the values of
which differ from person to person. There is no direct means of measuring their values except
to compare measured respiratory waveshapes with those predicted by modeling, and to adjust
their values in the model until differences become minimal.
The force and power criteria of optimization are merged in these cost functionals. The
first term in Ji can be seen to minimize something akin to mean squared force, and the second
term to minimize respiratory work. The unity of this approach is appealing, as are the results
of this approach, which show the transitions that occur in respiratory waveform from rest to
exercise.
Breathing waveshapes are typified by those seen in Figure 4.3.35. Part A shows a typical
resting breathing waveshape. Inhalation is sinusoidal and exhalation, being largely passive, is
exponential. Part B shows a typical waveshape for moderate exercise. Both inhalation and
exhalation are now active, and both appear to be nearly trapezoidal with rounded corners. The
trapezoidal waveshape was shown to result from a minimization of respiratory power if
airways resistance is taken to be inversely related to lung volume (Ruttimann and Yamamoto,
1972) or a result of minimizing J′i with constant respiratory resistance (Hämäläinen and
Sipilä, 1980). The rounded corners are probably a result of penalizing rapid accelerations, as
included in both Ji and J′i.
Typical respiratory waveforms for heavy exercise are seen in part C. Inhalation
waveforms are still nearly trapezoidal, indicating that the same optimization process active in
moderate exercise still governs heavy exercise. Exhalation, however, has reverted to
exponential waveshapes. This is because exhalation flow rate is limited (Figure 4.2.20), and
the value of the limiting flow rate decreases as lung volume decreases. The exhalation
waveshape is no longer completely determined by neural control but is determined mainly by
respiratory mechanical events. For any given tidal volume, exhalation time cannot decrease
any further, and whether or not exhalation is still optimized has not been determined.


266

Figure 4.3.35 Typical progression of breathing waveshapes as exercise intensifies. Part A is a typical
flow pattern at rest, with sinusoidal inhalation and exponential (passive) exhalation. During moderate
exercise (B), inhalation and exhalation waveforms become trapezoidal in shape. Severe exercise (C) is
accompanied by expiratory flow limitation resulting again in an expiratory exponential waveshape.


267

The dimples appearing in inhalation waveforms in parts B and C of Figure 4.3.35 are also
seen quite often. The exact meaning of this topographical feature is not known, but, under
some conditions of minimizing J′i, a dimple does appear in midinspiration.
Hämäläinen and Viljanen (1978b) presented a hierarchical context for respiratory
optimization models to fit within (Figure 4.3.36). They assumed no details of the ventilatory
demand process, but, once the demand for a certain alveolar ventilation rate is made known,
the system is considered to provide this rate of alveolar ventilation within the framework of an
optimal solution. First, the system is assumed to directly set respiration rate and inhalation
time–exhalation time ratio (Johnson and Masaitis, 1976; Yamashiro et al., 1975). At this time,
as well, the system may set respiratory dead volume. Widdicombe and Nadel (1963) were the
first to propose that, since dead volume is proportional to airways volume but resistance is
inversely related to airways volume, an optimal balance could be achieved. Other possibly
optimized parameters include expiratory reserve volume (similar to preload on the heart:
inspiration is made easier at the expense of expiration) and perhaps respiratory compliance (as
respiratory muscle tone increases, compliance decreases). It may be that there are several
control levels within this set of parameters, and that some of this set are conceptually
determined before others. For instance, respiratory period must be settled before inhalation
time can be determined.
Once these parameters are fixed, the lower level criteria (such as the Ji and Je previously
discussed) determine breathing waveshape. Considered to be constants at this lower level are
the optimized parameters of the upper level. This can be seen, for example, in Equation
4.3.31, where inhalation time is assumed to be fixed.
Optimization models are considered further in Section 4.5. But for now, we summarize
this discussion by noting that it appears to be true that respiratory responses to exercise are
optimized; this is a reasonable presumption, but evidence for the optimization assertion rests

Figure 4.3.36 A schematic diagram of the hierarchical model of respiratory control. Ventilatory demand
can be determined by chemoreceptors. Such basic quantities as respiration rate are optimized to reduce
ventilatory muscle oxygen demand. Once respiration rate is determined, such variables as inhalation
time/exhalation time ratio and breathing waveshape are optimized as well. (Used with permission from
Hämäläinen and Viljanen, 1978b.)

with correspondence between modeling results and experimental measurements. At present, a
total picture of the optimal controller is not available (Bates, 1986), nor is it clear that the
correspondence between model results and experimental results is the consequence of an
active optimization process or some preprogrammed genetic code.
Summary of Control Theories. There are certainly enough theories of respiratory control
to explain exercise hyperpnea (Whipp, 1981). None, however, can account for all details of
respiratory response. At the same time, none of the surviving theories has been conclusively
proven to be false.
If there are weaknesses in these theories, two seem to be paramount. First, those control
schemes proposed by bioengineers, and which appear to be reasonably successful in their
modeling results, cannot be easily translated into physiological mechanisms with known sites,
actions, and interconnections which can subsequently be tested by physiological experiment.
Second, proposed control schemes do not appear to account for the tremendous amount of
redundancy built into respiratory control: there may not be one important input as much as
one hundred; there may be many different ways in which any given output state may be
determined. Therefore, it is not surprising that each of these control theories only partly
explains respiratory response to exercise, since each theory proposes the preeminence of a
limited number of mechanisms.
Physiologists have for years debated the relative importance of neural and humoral
mechanisms of control. The humoral component is presumed to be related to one or more of
the following: VDCO 2 , pCO2, pH, VDO2 metabolites, and oxygen saturation of blood

hemoglobin. Most physiologists assume that the humoral component of respiratory regulation
is too slowly developed to be responsible for the rapid increase in ventilation at the onset of
exercise, but they also assume that the humoral component is the major contributor to the
steady-state respiratory response (Whipp, 1982). This assumption is still the subject of
controversy because some scientists claim that humoral causes also control rapid responses at
the onset of exercise.
Neural control mechanisms are thought to arise in muscle spindles, joint proprioceptors,
muscle thermoreceptors, the cerebral cortex, and elsewhere. Because these inputs are thought
to be connected directly and indirectly by means of the nervous system to the respiratory
control areas of the brain, they are considered to result in rapid ventilatory responses. They are
usually not considered to be the major contributor to steady-state respiratory response. Again,
there is some controversy over that assumption, and we have already seen in this section that
neurogenic mechanisms can underlie at least part of the steady-state response.
More specific theories have been advanced to explain steady-state and slow responses of
respiration. The first of these involves some amount of steady-state error in the mean arterial
level of pCO2 or H+. The steady-state ventilatory response would then be proportional to this
error.
VDE = k(pCO2 – pnCO2)

(4.3.34)
D
where V E = minute volume, m /sec
k = coefficient of proportionality, m5/(sec·N)
pnCO2 = “normal,” or set-point, value of arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, N/m2
As simple as this theory is, however, it does not seem to reflect the true situation in normal
subjects, where changes (which, if any, are small) in mean arterial pCO2 or pH are viewed as
a consequence, rather than the cause, of ventilatory adjustments (Whipp, 1981).
A variation of this theory asserts that a steady-state error in pH can exist at
chemoreceptor sites without a measurable change in arterial pH. This is because carbonic
anhydrase is found in the interior of the erythrocyte but not in the plasma. Due to differences
in the time it takes to establish equilibrium between CO2, H2CO3, and HCO3– (see Equation
3.2.3) in plasma and red blood cells, blood perfusing the carotid bodies could be more acid
3


269

than whole blood (Whipp, 1981). Whereas this effect has been demonstrated theoretically and
in the laboratory, it has yet to be proved important in real life.
It has been mentioned previously that Whipp (1981) and others (Miyamoto et al., 1983)
observed that ventilation follows CO2 delivery to the lungs. That is, the cardiac output (or rate
of blood flow to the lungs) times blood concentration of carbon dioxide must be matched by
an appropriate alveolar ventilation rate or a change in blood pCO2 is bound to occur. This
change would then act as a powerful stimulant to the respiratory controller to correct the pCO2
error. While this particular idea of respiratory control begs the question of control
mechanisms, it is a simple statement of respiratory reaction. From a simple mass balance,
CO2 delivered to the lung = CO2 removed by the blood + CO2 removed by air

QD pulm cvCO 2 = QD pulm c a CO2 + VDA FeCO 2 alv

(4.3.35)
(4.3.36)

where QD pulm = pulmonary perfusion, or cardiac output, m3/sec
cCO 2 = carbon dioxide concentration, m3/m3
VDA = alveolar ventilation rate, m3/sec
FeCO 2 alv = fraction of CO2 in alveolar air, m3/ m3
a, v = subscripts denoting arterial and venous values
From Table 4.2.2, resting cardiac output is 10-4 m3/sec, and from Table 4.2.8, alveolar
mass fraction of carbon dioxide is 0.056 m3/m3. From Table 3.2.1, resting values of carbon
dioxide concentration in arterial and venous blood for males are 0.490 and 0.531 m3 CO2/m3
blood, respectively. Therefore,
VDA =

Qpulm (cvCO 2 − c aCO 2 )
FeCO2 alv

(4.3.37)

= 7.32 x 10–5 m3/sec
By adding the dead volume ventilation rate
VDD = VD /T

(4.3.38)

where VDD = rate of dead volume ventilation, m3/sec
VD = dead volume, m3
T = respiratory period, sec
we obtain
VDE = VDA + VDD

(4.3.39)

where VDE = minute volume, m /sec
3

From Table 4.2.4, VD = 180 x 10-6m3, and T = 4 sec. Calculated VE then becomes 118 x 10-3
cm3/sec, which compares favorably to the tabled (approximate) value of 100 x 10-3 cm3/sec.
The conclusion of this calculation is that alveolar ventilation rate appears to be calculable
from cardiac output and pulmonary arterial–venous carbon dioxide concentration difference.
The last theory of respiratory regulation which is to be summarized here is based not on
steady-state carbon dioxide values but on the oscillations that occur in the blood during the
normal respiratory cycle. This theory of control was proposed by Yamamoto (1960). It is the
contention of this theory that average values of pCO2 and pH can remain constant, but because
exercising conditions produce more CO2 and lower pH compared to rest, the depth of


270

Figure 4.3.37 Control loops for respiration. The chemical loop assures adequate ventilation to remove
excess CO2 and the neural loop ensures that ventilation is maintained at least cost. If, for some reason
such as a limitation on exhalation flow rate, least cost cannot be preserved, ventilation is forced to
increase. Such a situation can lead to instability in respiratory control for respiratory-impaired subjects.
(Adapted from Johnson, 1980.)

oscillations increases. These oscillations are felt at the level of the carotid bodies, and it has
been shown that carotid chemoreceptors are rate sensitive (Whipp, 1981). Indeed, there has
been demonstrated a periodicity in carotid chemoreceptor discharge which matches the
oscillations in the blood (Whipp, 1981).
There seems to be other supporting evidence for this mechanism of control. Decreasing
blood oscillations of pCO2 and pH by means of a mixing chamber has been found to decrease
minute volume in cats (Whipp, 1981). Results of this experiment are not so easy to interpret,
however, because other conditions, besides oscillations, also changed. The fact that subjects
without carotid bodies respond to exercise with steady-state values of minute volume which
are not significantly different from those of control subjects casts doubt on the importance of
oscillations, at least in the steady state (Whipp, 1981).
A schematic diagram of respiratory control (Johnson, 1980) seen in Figure 4.3.37
illustrates the two main control loops for respiration. The two control criteria seem to be to (1)
maintain CO2 levels (2) at least cost. When these two control criteria cannot be maintained,
the situation certainly calls for alarm. Normally, no degree of exercise is sufficient to cause
this lack of control. But maximal exercise being performed in a respiratory protective mask
can be one instance when control is lost.
To give some idea of the problems that might be encountered, imagine this scenario: the
subject works on a bicycle ergometer at a constant rate of 250 N·m/sec while wearing a mask.
The mask has enough resistance and dead volume to roughly double the resistance and dead
volume he must breathe through without the mask. As his muscles work, they produce CO2,
which, in turn, requires a higher minute ventilation.85 His respiratory system answers the need
by breathing faster and somewhat deeper, as dictated by the minimization of respiratory
85
Martin et al. (1984) showed that respiratory muscles are required to anaerobically metabolize energy to sustain high exercise
levels. This would cause an even greater ventilatory stimulus due to lowered blood pH.


271

power. The mask makes his respiratory muscles work harder than usual. The slow trend
toward faster breathing is suddenly interrupted by a limitation on the rate at which he can
exhale. The respiratory response is no longer optimized, and his respiratory muscles become
less efficient, producing more CO2 for a given minute ventilation increment than they did
before. This requires faster breathing, which produces more CO2, which requires faster
breathing, and so on. The system is now effectively out of control.
The result, as we have seen in the laboratory, is an end point which is characterized by:
1. Panic-a strong feeling of breathlessness is developed.
2. Persistence-the feeling continues for several minutes after the cessation of exercise.
3. Pointedness -there is a clear indication that the mask is a major contributor to the
feeling of breathlessness. (Remove the mask and the feeling goes away.)
Interestingly, we have not been able to duplicate this end point in any subject who once
experienced it. This could mean that there are unconscious physiological clues which the
subject learns to seriously heed to avoid ever having to face that situation again.
This scenario is a practical illustration of respiratory control and its limitations.
4.4 RESPIRATORY MECHANICAL MODELS
Respiratory mechanical models are many and varied. For the sake of presentation, these
models are classified as (1) models of respiratory mechanics, including airflow models and
mechanical parameter models, (2) gas transport models, and (3) other types of models,
including models of pulmonary vasculature (Heijmans et al., 1986; Linehan and Dawson,
1983), muscle mechanics (Macklem et al., 1983), and lung deformation (Ligas, 1984; Vawter,
1980). The third classification of models is not included here, because these models are too
specific for our discussion. Nevertheless, they may appear to be of extreme interest to some
respiratory mechanical modelers.
4.4.1

Respiratory Mechanics Models

Again, some discrimination between models must be performed to distinguish between the
many respiratory mechanical models which have been proposed. Some models have as their
sole purpose the improved measurement of respiratory mechanical parameters (Clément et al.,
1981; de Wilde et al., 1981; Johnson et al., 1984; Lorino et al., 1982; Nada and Linkens, 1977;
Peslin et al., 1975). That is, measurements are forced to conform to general model schemes in
order to extract best estimates of resistance, compliance, and other respiratory mechanical
parameters. These models are not reviewed here because their general predictive ability is
limited. Some other models have special purposes, such as improved design and use of
hospital ventilators (Barbini, 1982), estimation of lung diffusing capacity (Prisk and
McKinnon, 1987), and deposition of aerosol particles (Kim et al., 1983). These models are not
reviewed here. Of the models not included, the one by Hardy et al. (1982) is worthy of note
because of its inclusiveness, but its emphasis is circulatory, and it is not as illustrative as those
included here.
The two types of models reviewed here are examples of general predictive respiratory
mechanical models and several more specific flow-determining models.
Jackson-Milhorn Computer Model. This model is a comprehensive model of respiratory
mechanics which responds realistically. Jackson and Milhorn (1973) modeled the lungs as two
compartments within the pleural space and chest wall (Figure 4.4.1). Figure 4.4.1 shows the
various pressures that act on model elements.


272

Figure 4.4.1 Schematic diagram of the respiratory system showing the pressures acting on the lungs, rib
cage, and abdomen–diaphragm. Resistance and pressure symbols are defined in the text. (Used with
permission from Jackson and Milhorn, 1973.)

As with many of these models, Jackson and Milhorn began with a basic pressure balance:

papp = pst + pres + pin

(4.4.1)

where papp = pressure applied to any element of the respiratory system, N/m2
pst = static recoil pressure due to compliance, N/m2
pres = pressure loss due to resistance, N/m2
pin = pressure loss due to inertance, N/m2
As in Figure 4.4.1, they portrayed the respiratory system with two lung compartments,
representing right and left lungs, and two thoracic components, representing rib cage and
abdomen–diaphragm.
Pressure balances on each of these components yields, for the lungs,

palvR – ppl = (pst)lR + (pres)lR + (pin)lR

(4.4.2a)

palvL – ppl = (pst)lL + (pres)lL + (pin)lL

(4.4.2b)

where palv = alveolar pressure, N/m2
ppl = pleural pressure, N/m2
and the subscript l denotes lungs, subscripts L and R specify left or right. Then for the rib
cage

ppl + (pmus)rc – pbs = (pst)rc + (pres)rc + (pin)rc
where pmus = respiratory muscle pressure, N/m2
pbs = body surface pressure, N/m2

(4.4.3)


273

and the subscript rc denotes rib cage. Then for the abdomen–diaphragm

ppl + (pmus)ad – pbs = (pst)ad + (pres)ad + (pin)ad

(4.4.4)

where the subscript ad denotes abdomen-diaphragm.
Static recoil pressure due to compliance can be calculated from

pst = (V – Vr)/C

(4.4.5)

where V = lung volume, m3
Vr = resting, or stable, volume, m3
C = compliance, m5/N
Instead, it appears that Jackson and Milhorn numerically evaluated recoil pressure from
pressure-volume characteristics, as given later.
Resistive pressure is calculated from
pres = VD R
(4.4.6)
3
where VD = flow rate, m /sec
R = resistance, N·sec/m5
and inertial pressure is calculated from

pin = VDDI
(4.4.7)
2
D
D
where V = volume acceleration, m /sec
I = inertance, N·sec2/m5
Jackson and Milhorn included nonlinear and time-dependent compliance characteristics
within their model. The three static pressures, (pst)l, (pst)rc, and (pst)ad, are estimated in
different ways. Rib cage and abdomen-diaphragm pressure-volume characteristics (the slope
is compliance) were assumed to be those in Figure 4.4.2. Their model determined static recoil
pressures once lung volume was known.
Static recoil pressure of the lungs was developed from lung tissue and lung surfactant
(see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.3):
3

(pst)l = (pst)sur + (pst)lt

(4.4.8)

where (pst)sur = surfactant static recoil pressure, N/m2
(pst)lt = lung tissue recoil pressure, N/m2
Jackson and Milhorn (1973) based their lung surfactant model on the results of Archie (1968),
who developed an equation defining elastic recoil pressure as a result of surface tension forces
of a thin surfactant film at the air–liquid interface. The equation assumes that a film of
constant thickness lines the alveolar surfaces and that surface tension of this film is inversely
proportional to the concentration of two different macromolecules diffusing to and from this
film from an underlining bulk phase having constant concentration. The equations they used
are

constituent, dimensionless
Li = dimensionless constant
τi = diffusion time constant of the ith constituent, sec
t = time, sec
VA∞ = alveolar volume where thermodynamic equilibrium occurs, m3
Values for these parameters are listed in Table 4.4.1. These equations predict hysteresis, the
gradual decline in compliance with constant tidal volume, and the return to greater compliance
following a deep breath or sigh.
The tissue component of lung compliance pressure was obtained empirically by matching
model results to published experimental results. Tissue recoil pressure was obtained by
subtraction of calculated surfactant pressure from experimental stop-flow results. The result
appears in Figure 4.4.3, where the curve represents the tissue pressure–volume characteristic
for each lung.
Tissue resistance values used by Jackson and Milhorn are similar to those presented in
Table 4.2.15. They used a minimum value for lung tissue resistance, which became very small
compared to airway resistance. They did not mention the value used.
Because they intended to simulate high breathing rates, Jackson and Milhorn included
inertial pressures. In partitioning total respiratory inertance, they assumed that pulmonary
inertance and chest wall inertance appear in series, but that rib cage and abdomen–diaphragm
inertance (together comprising chest wall inertance) act in parallel with each other. Pulmonary
inertance is composed mainly of inertance of the gases in the airways and a somewhat smaller
amount of lung tissue inertance. Inertance values are given in Table 4.4.1.

Compiled from Jackson and Milhorn, 1973.

Air movement in each of the conducting airways was assumed to occur as a unit of mass.
This air was assumed to be incompressible (compliance therefore is zero). A pressure
difference between two successive compartments causes movement of the air column
connecting them. Jackson and Milhorn assumed four distinct airway compartment types:
alveolar space, lower airways, upper airways, and mouthpiece. There are two (left and right)
alveolar and lower airways compartments in parallel. These compartments are schematically
diagramed in Figure 4.4.4.
Considering first the mouthpiece and associated equipment gives
pbs – pao = Rm (dV1/dt) + Im (d2V1 /dt2)

(4.4.12)

where pbs = body surface pressure, N/m2
pao = airway opening pressure, N/m2
Rm = mouthpiece resistance, N·sec/m5
Im = mouthpiece inertance, N·sec2/m5
V1 = volume of air moving from mouthpiece to atmosphere (across point 1), m3
To determine pao the upper airway compartment must be considered. During inspiration there
is a mass of air entering the upper airway compartment equal to the air density ρ times V1.
Likewise, the mass of air leaving the compartment is ρV2. The rate of change of mass is thus
dmuaw/dt = ρ1 VD1 – ρ2 VD2

(4.4.13)

277

where muaw = mass in upper airway compartment, kg
ρ = air density, kg/m3
VD2 = rate of change of volume moving from upper airway to mouthpiece (across
point 2), m3
and
dmuaw = ( ρ1VD1 − ρ 2VD2 ) dt

(4.4.14)

∆muaw = ρ1V1 – ρ2V2

(4.4.15)

where ∆muaw = change of mass in the upper airway compartment in an arbitrary time interval
∆t, kg
The change of density within the upper airway compartment is
∆ρuaw = ∆muaw /Vuaw = (ρ1V1 – ρ2V2)/ Vuaw

(4.4.16)

where Vuaw = upper airway volume, m3
The bulk modulus B is defined (Anderson, 1967) as
where B = bulk modulus, N/m2
This becomes

B = ρ dp/dρ

dpao = B(dρ / ρ) = (B/ρuaw)(ρ1V1 – ρ2V2)/Vuaw

(4.4.17)

(4.4.18)

where dpao ≅ ∆ pao – the change in airway opening pressure between any two instances of
time, N/m2
Substituting Equation 4.4.18 into Equation 4.4.12 yields
Im(d2V1/dt2) + Rm(dV1/dt) + (BρbsV1 /ρuaw Vuaw) – (BV2 /Vuaw) – pbs = 0

(4.4.19)

Since airway density changes by no more than 1% with a pressure change of 980 N/m2 (10 cm
H2O), Equation 4.4.19 can be simplified by assuming all densities to have the same value.
Thus for the mouthpiece
Im(d2V1/dt2) + Rm(dV1/dt) + (B/Vuaw) V1 – (B/Vuaw)/V2 – pbs = 0

(4.4.20)

A similar equation for the upper airway is
Iuaw(d2V2/dt2) + Ruaw(dV2/dt) + [(B/Vlaw + B/Vuaw)]V2
– (B/Vlaw) VaL – (B/Vlaw)VaR – (B/Vuaw) V1 = 0

(4.4.21)

where Iuaw = upper airway inertance, N·sec2/m5
Ruaw = upper airway resistance, N·sec2/m5
Vlaw = lower airway volume, m3
VaL = volume of air moving between left lung lower airways compartment and upper
airways, m3
VaR = volume of air moving between right lung lower airways compartment and upper
airways, m3


278

For the lower airways (left lung)
IlawL(d2VaL/dt2) + RlawL(dVaL/dt) + [(B/VAL) + B/Vlaw)]VaL
– (B/Vlaw)V2 + (B/Vlaw)VaR – (B/VAL)∆VAL = 0

(4.4.22)

where IlawL = lower airway inertance of left compartment, N·sec2/m5
RlawL = lower airway resistance of left compartment, N·sec/m5
VAL = alveolar volume of left lung, m3
∆VAL = change in alveolar volume, m5
A similar equation for the right lung lower airways is
IlawR(d2VaR/dt2) + RlawR(dVaR/dt) + [(B/VAR) + B/Vlaw)]VaR
– (B/Vlaw)V2 + (B/Vlaw)VaL – (B/VAR)∆VAR= 0

(4.4.23)

Solution of these closely coupled equations must begin with a known change in alveolar
volume and then volume changes may be successively calculated between each of the other
compartments.
Pressure changes within each compartment are calculated from
∆pao = (B/Vuaw)(V1 – V2)

(4.2.24)

∆paw = (B/Vlaw)(V2 – VaR – VaL)

(4.2.25)

∆palvR = (B/ValvR)(VaR – ∆ValvR)

(4.2.26)

∆palvL = (B/ValvL)(VaL – ∆ValvL)

(4.2.27)

Values for constants in Equations 4.4.12–4.4.27 appear in Table 4.4.1. From the ideal gas law,
the value for bulk modulus of a gas is equal to the static pressure of the gas for isothermal
compression. For adiabatic compression, the bulk modulus for air is 1.4 times the static
pressure.86
To describe airway resistance, Jackson and Milhorn considered upper and lower airway
resistances separately. Upper airway resistance was described using the Rohrer model with
different values for inhalation and exhalation coefficients:
Ruawi = K1i + K2i Vi

(4.4.28a)

Ruawe = K1e + K2e VDe

(4.4.28b)

where i denotes inspiration and e denotes expiration. Lower airway resistances (left and right)
are described by
RlawR = 2/(G2VAR – G1)

(4.4.29a)

RlawL = 2/(G2VAL – G1)

(4.4.29b)

where G2 and G1 are constants.
The use of these equations to describe lower airways resistances thus includes the effect
of lung volume on the sizes of the very distensible small airways. Since these airways are
thought to close when lung volume reaches residual volume, the ratio G1/G2 must represent
residual volume in each lung because at VA = G1/G2, Rlaw tends to ∞.
86
The value 1.4 is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume. This value holds
approximately for all diatomic gases (Hawkins, 1967).


279

Upper airways volume was assumed to be a constant 70 cm3. Lower airways volume, on
the other hand, was assumed to vary significantly. Jackson and Milhorn derived their
relationship between lower airways volume and lower airways resistance in the following
manner.
The volume of a tube with circular cross section is
Vlaw ∝ r2l

(4.4.30a)
where r = tube radius
l = tube length
If airflow in these airways obeys Poiseuilles' law (see Section 3.2.2), then resistance is
proportional to length and inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power:
Thus

Rlaw ∝ l/r4

(4.4.30b)

Vlaw ∝ (l3/Rlaw)1/2

(4.4.30c)

Jackson and Milhorn cite some evidence that the length of the lower airways in excised lungs
is a function of the cube root of the lung volume.87 Thus
Vlaw = G3[VA/Rlaw]1/2

(4.4.30d)

where G3 = constant coefficient, (N·sec)1/2/m
VA = alveolar volume of left and right lungs, m3
The next compartment to be considered is the pleural cavity. Changes in respiratory
system volume can be generated only by movement of rib cage and/or abdomen–diaphragm.
This volume change must be accompanied by a change in either or both lung and pleural
cavity. Therefore, changes in volume of abdomen–diaphragm and/or rib cage are reflected by
a change in volume of pleural cavity and/or lungs:
∆Vad + ∆Vrc = ∆Vpl + ∆VA

(4.4.31)

The pleural space is depicted as very stiff (has low compliance of 53 x 10-9 m5/N):
∆ppl = –∆Vpl /Cpl

(4.4.32)

where Cpl = pleural compliance, m5/N
The negative sign preceding the change in pleural volume indicates that a smaller volume is
accompanied by an increase in pressure.
Two driving pressures were used by Jackson and Milhorn. These driving pressures take
the form of time-varying muscle pressures applied to the model. The first condition describes
normal resting breathing [oxygen consumption 5 x 10-6 m3/sec (300 mL/min)]:
pmus = 671t + 574t2 – 474 t3,

0 ≤ t ≤ 1.25 sec

(4.4.33a)

pmus = 1760 – 980t + 130t2,

1.25 ≤ t ≤ 3.5 sec

(4.4.33b)

pmus = 0,

3.5 < t

(4.4.33c)

where pmus = muscle pressure, N/m2
87
One would expect tube length to vary with the cube root of lung volume on purely dimensional grounds. Tube length has a
dimension of length, L. Lung volume, which comprises many of these tubes and their alveolar extensions, has a dimension of
3
L . Thus tube length would be expected to vary as volume to the one-third power. The same general philosophy is used in
calculation of binary mixture diffusivities (Equation 4.2.29).


280

During exercise [oxygen consumption 56.88 x 10-6 m3/sec (3413 mL/min)]
pmus = 784 + 2210 sin (5.03t – 0.179)

(4.4.34)

Jackson and Milhorn assumed parallel rib cage and abdomen–diaphragm contributions to
muscle pressure, so that
pmus = (pmus)ad = (pmus)rc

(4.4.35)

where (pmus)ad = abdomen–diaphragm contribution to muscle pressure, N/m2
(pmus)rc = rib cage contribution to muscle pressure, N/m2
The structure of their model requires implicit, or iterative, methods of solution at several
points. Unfortunately, details of this process were not given in their original paper (see
Appendix 3.1 for solution methods). Jackson and Milhorn programmed their model on a
digital computer and simulated respiratory system response to spontaneous breathing at rest
and during exercise. They also simulated two very rapid disturbances produced by (1) the
interrupter technique for estimating dynamic alveolar pressure and (2) the stop-flow technique
for determining the quasistatic pressure–volume relationships of the lung. Two pathological
conditions which were simulated were (1) decreased concentration of surfactant and (2)
unilateral partial airway obstruction. Results from these simulations are described only
partially here.
Figure 4.4.5 shows experimental and model results of alveolar volume, airflow, and
muscle pressure for spontaneous breathing at rest. The calculated experimentally derived
driving pressure produced a tidal volume of 480 x 10-6 m3 and maximum volume occurring at
1.55 sec. Experimental peak airflow rates were 450 x 10-6 m3/sec (expiration) and 500 x 10-6
m3/sec (inspiration); model peak airflow rates were 350 x 10-6 m3/sec (expiration) and 550 x
10-6 m3/sec (inspiration). Other results simulating rest were reasonably good as well.
Exercise simulation did not yield as close agreement between model and experiment. In
Figure 4.4.6 are shown some of these comparisons between experimental and model results
for muscle pressure, airflow, and lung volume. The authors attribute the disagreement mainly
to the driving pressure used, since it was derived with airway resistance assumptions different
from those used in their model.

One notable result involves calculated airway resistance values. During rest, upper
airway resistance and lower airway resistance are of nearly equal magnitude. During exercise,
however, most of the airway resistance occurs in the upper airways. Indeed, resistance
pressure drops during rest and exercise were very great compared to inertance pressure drops,
and the inclusion of inertances probably was not necessary to satisfactory model results for all
but the rapid airway interruption maneuver.
Expiratory Flow Model. The notion of expiratory flow limitation has already been
introduced in Section 4.2.3. Lambert et al. (1982) produced a model which has been adjusted
to yield good agreement with experimental results.
Lambert et al. began by assuming the ideal lung geometry given by Weibel (Section
4.2.1), where the conducting airways form a symmetric bifurcating tree. Airway mechanics
were assumed to change more or less smoothly from one generation to the next, with lower
airways being more compliant than upper airways. The trachea was assumed to have the same
mechanical properties as the bronchi. Within this system, flow was considered to be steady
and incompressible. All pressures were referenced to pleural pressure, and peribronchial
pressure was assumed equal to pleural pressure. Alveolar gas pressure was assumed to be
uniform and equal to static recoil pressure at each lung volume:

p = pst – pkin – pfric
where p = net lateral airway pressure, N/m2
pst = static pressure (no flow), N/m2
pkin = kinetic pressure component, N/m2
pfric = friction pressure loss, N/m2

(4.4.36)


282

This can be expanded to give
p = pst –

(4.4.37)

where ρ = gas density, kg/m3
VD = volume rate of flow, m3/sec
A = total cross-sectional area of all airways in the nth generation, m2
f = friction pressure loss per unit distance, N/m3
dx = distance along airway axis, m
The pressure gradient along the airway axis is obtained by differentiating Equation 4.4.37
with respect to x:

(4.4.38)

Here, the volume rate of flow cannot vary with x unless flow is unsteady, but total
generational cross-sectional area is assumed to vary from generation to generation (see Table
4.2.1).

(4.2.79)

which combines with Equation 4.4.40 to give
2
dp/dx = – f / (1 – V 2 /Vws
)

(4.4.41)

As the flow speed V approaches wave speed Vws , the pressure gradient along the direction of
the conducting airways becomes very large. Apparent resistance of the airways thus becomes
very large as well.
Since the geometry of the bronchial tree is so complicated, it is difficult to obtain an
accurate expression for the distribution of viscous pressure loss f. An empirical formula used
by Lambert et al. is
f=

8πµVC
A2

(3.4 + 2.1 x 10 -3 Re)

(4.4.42)

where µ = fluid (air) viscosity, kg/(m·sec)
Re = local Reynolds number, dimensionless
Re = 2 ρVD / µ πA
3

where ρ = density, kg/m

(4.4.43)


283

As Lambert et al. explain, the coefficient 8πµ V / A 2 is the pressure loss per unit length in
Poiseuille flow (see Equations 3.2.12 and 4.4.30b). At low Reynolds numbers, laminar
viscous pressure losses in the branching network are 3.4 times larger than for flow in a long,
smooth-walled, straight rigid pipe. At high Reynolds numbers, the second term in parentheses
in Equation 4.4.42 predominates. This term, which describes fully turbulent dissipative losses,
gives a pressure loss quadratic in V . Both terms are equivalent at a local Reynolds number of
1600. Both terms together give a pressure loss in the airways similar to the Rohrer equation
(4.2.61) in that pressure loss is determined by a term linear in V and another quadratic in
V .88
Pressure is computed in steps, beginning at the periphery (alveolus) and working toward
central airways (bronchi and trachea). Equation 4.4.41 is integrated over the length of the nth
generational airway to obtain a pressure drop along that airway. The friction pressure loss is
calculated using the empirical relationship in Equation 4.4.42. At the junction between
generations, transitional flow is assumed to take place over such a short distance that frictional
dissipation f dx is considered negligible. Equation 4.4.37 can thus be evaluated at the two
points represented by the end (distance = L) of the (n+1)th generation and the beginning
(distance = 0) of the nth generation. The pressure difference at the junction is thus

[

pn + 1(L) – pn(0) = ½ ρV 2 1 / An2 (0) −1 / An2+1 ( L)

]

(4.4.44a)

where pn(0) = pressure at the beginning of nth generation airway, N/m2
pn + 1(0) = pressure at end of (n + 1)th generation airway, N/m2
An(0) = cross-sectional airway at beginning of nth generation, m2
An + 1(L) = cross-sectional airway area at end of (n + 1)th generation, m2
Equation 4.4.44a is assumed true if the area at the convergence of the airways decreases, that
is, if An(0) ≤ An + 1(L). If, on the other had, intergenerational airways area increases, no
pressure difference is assumed:
pn + 1(L) – pn (0) = 0,

An(0) ≥ An + 1(L)

(4.4.44b)

As seen in Tables 4.2.1 and 4.4.2, total cross-sectional area of all airways in any generation
increases from the nth generation to the (n + 1)th generation. Therefore, Equation 4.4.44a
would be expected to be used at every junction. However, due to certain combinations of
airway distensibility and pressure drops, the condition An(0) > An+1(L) may hold, and Equation
4.4.44b would be required. Since the choice between these two equations demands knowledge
of airway area, Lambert et al. developed a model of airway dimensions.
Airways are described as characterized by a maximum area modified by transmural
pressure. The assumed shape of this relation, as illustrated in Figure 4.2.21, is similar to the
pressure–volume characteristics for the entire lung, seen in Figure 4.2.23. This relationship is
described by two rectangular hyperbolas matched in value and slope at zero pressure. These
curves are normalized by dividing airway by maximum airway area:
α = A/Am

(4.4.45)

where α = normalizing model parameter, dimensionless
Am = maximum total cross-sectional generational airway area, m2
88
In an airway cast model, Slutsky et al. (1980) found the Moody friction factor for central human airways to decrease linearly
with tracheal Reynolds number until the Reynolds number became 500. Above a Reynolds number of 5000, there was no
further change in friction factor. In between was an extended transition zone where the friction factor decreased at a rate
proportional to the square root of the Reynolds number. Because branching angles of the airways in the upper lobes were
greater than those of the lower lobes, resistances to the upper lobes were greater and flow was less than to the lower lobes.

These two hyperbolas are given by

and

where α0 = value of α at p = 0, dimensionless
p1, p2 = vertical asymptotes for the two hyperbolas, N/m2
n1, n2 = hyperbola parameters, dimensionless
They are chosen to match in value at p = 0. They are also chosen so that their slopes match at
the intersection points (Figure 4.4.7). This produces equations for the vertical asymptotes, p1
and p2:
p1 = α0n1 / α′0

(4.4.47a)

p2 = – n2(1 – α0)/α′0

(4.4.47b)

where α′0 = dα/dp at p = 0, m2/N
Values of αo, α′o, n1, n2, Am, and airway length L used in the model are given in Table
4.4.2. Values were chosen to match, as closely as possible, experimental data from Weibel
(1963) and Hyatt et al. (1980). Estimates for αo for central airways (low generational numbers)
were easily obtained from these experimental data and appear to have an approximately
logarithmic decrease with generation number. For peripheral airways, however, no
experimental data were available to guide the choice of αo. The logarithmic decrease was thus
extrapolated, although the slope was increased somewhat for the smaller airways. Lambert et
al. argued that if the airways behaved isotropically with the lung, airway dimensions would
vary with the cube root of lung volume. However, for the smaller airways, the finite wall
thickness becomes important, and airway luminal diameter would decrease much more than
the cube root of lung volume. The value for αo, which refers to lumen area, would be very
low. Estimates of α′o were chosen to bring the airway area–pressure curves to near maximal

area at reasonable pressures. The complete set of model A/Am versus p curves, as outlined in
Figure 4.4.7, appears in Figure 4.4.8. The curve for the trachea (generation 0) was assumed to
be identical to that for the bronchi (generation 1).
The calculation procedure used by Lambert followed this general course: for each static
recoil pressure, a relatively small value of VD was chosen, and Equations 4.4.44a or b and
4.4.46a and b were solved at the entrance of generation 16. Equation 4.4.41 was integrated
along the airway, using an airway area from the curves in Figure 4.4.8 for each local value of
p at each point. This procedure was repeated for each generation to the end of the trachea. The

value of VD was then increased, and the procedure was repeated. This continued until one of
these three conditions was met:
1. Local velocity came within 99.9% of wave speed at some point in the bronchial tree.
2. There was no simultaneous solution to Equations 4.4.44a or b and 4.4.46a and b, indicating
that wave speed would be exceeded at the junction.
3. The pressure became less than – 9803 N/m2 (–100 cm H2O).
When one of these occurred, a smaller increment of flow was tried until a flow increment of
10-8 m3/sec (0.01 L/sec) exceeded maximal flow, where the calculation was halted. Therefore,
all maximal flows are within 10-8 m3/sec of wave speed or else a pressure decrease of –9803
N/m2 was produced. The location where one of these conditions occurs is the flow-limiting
site.
Figure 4.4.9 presents some results from the Lambert study. The upper portion shows the
isovolume pressure–flow relationships which Lambert et al. calculated. Notice the similarity
between these curves and those of Figure 4.2.19. In Figure 4.4.10 airway resistance is plotted
from the slopes of the curves in Figure 4.4.9 at a flow rate of 5 x 10-8 m3/sec for corresponding
lung volumes. Figure 4.4.11 presents model predictions of the flow-limiting site as a function
of static recoil pressure. At high recoil pressures (and high lung volumes), expiratory airflow
is limited in the central airways of main bronchi or trachea. At low recoil pressures (and low
lung volumes), expiratory flow is limited more and more peripherally. Although the
movement of flow-limiting segments has been confirmed experimentally (Smaldone and
Smith, 1985), this type of predictive ability best illustrates the use of models in biological
systems.
Ventilation Distribution Model with Nonlinear Components. A considerably
different sort of mechanical model was presented by Shykoff et al. (1982). This model,
although relatively simple in overall construction, differed from many other respiratory
models by incorporating nonlinearities into its respiratory components.
The intention of the model was to determine what differences in gas distribution within
the lung can be expected from variations of pleural pressure in different parts of the lung.
Unequal lung filling had previously been blamed mainly on unequal time constants in
different portions of the lung. New experimental evidence had suggested, however, that
pleural pressures were distributed unevenly between upper and lower chest, that these
differences were affected by the patterns of muscle use during spontaneous breathing, and that
these pressure differences might, indeed, produce variations in lung filling.

To test the hypothesis of a connection between pleural pressure differences and lung
filling, Shykoff et al. proposed a two-compartment lung model. The upper and lower
compartments were treated in a parallel arrangement, and each was considered to be
represented by a resistance and compliance in series. Each was exposed to a different variable
pleural pressure. A common resistance connected the two compartments (Figure 4.4.12).
Model equations for the common pathway are

Airflow into these compartments was driven by sinusoidal, square, or triangular waveforms
superimposed on a static pressure difference. The amplitudes of the pressures were
independently varied on the two compartments; a range of static pressures and frequencies
was used; and a phase lag between compartments was introduced for sinusoidal and squarewave pleural pressure variations.
The authors found that at low pleural pressure amplitudes and frequencies (up to 490
N/m2 at 0.25 breath/sec), there was essentially no difference between results using constant
compliance and resistance values and those using nonlinear values. At higher frequencies the
differences become greater at lower amplitudes, and at higher amplitudes the differences
become greater at lower frequencies. Compliance nonlinearities are more important at low
flow rates, but resistance nonlinearities are increasingly more important at higher flow rates.
The ratio of volumes in compartments 1 and 2 does not change appreciably for
sinusoidal, square, or triangular pleural pressure waveforms. Thus Shykoff et al. conclude that
the waveform of the pleural pressure swing has no effect on the distribution of tidal volumes,
unless very high initial flow rates are generated.
Oscillatory intralung airflow which does not involve the source is called pendelluft.
Pendelluft occurs in the lungs when one compartment, lobe, or portion fills faster than another
and eventually delivers part of its volume to another compartment, lobe, or portion. Pendelluft
was demonstrated in the model of Shykoff et al. and is illustrated in Figure 4.4.13 for the case
of a sinusoidal pleural pressure variation and no phase angle between compartments. As seen

Figure 4.4.13 Instantaneous flows, sinusoidal pressure. The flow rates in the total lung model, the upper
compartment, and the lower compartment are shown as a function of time. The pressure amplitude on the
upper compartment is 98 N/m2 (1.0 cm H2O) and that on the lower is 735 N/m2 (7.5 cm H2O). The static
pleural pressure difference is 392 N/m2 (4 cm H2O), and the pleural pressure variations on the
compartments are in phase. (Adapted and used with permission from Shykoff et al., 1982.)

in Figure 4.4.13, the lower compartment fills first, followed by emptying into the upper
compartment.
Although this model is a very simple one in structure as well as results, it has yielded
important information. The effects of nonlinearities are perhaps best highlighted by a model as
limited in scope as this one is.
Theory of Resistive Load Detection. The last of the respiratory mechanical models to be
included here is interesting because of the way it illustrates how modeling can be used to
suggest mechanisms of action. In this case, the model suggests, in a more rigorous manner
than previously attempted, how addition of resistance to the respiratory system can be
detected.
The model by Mahutte et al. (1983) begins with the general concept of length–tension
inappropriateness discussed previously (see Section 4.3.4). This concept involves the
detection of a mismatch between the demanded motor act and the achieved result. What
Mahutte et al. did was to show how this detection could occur. Note, however, that even the
most rational model results may differ from reality by huge amounts.
Mahutte et al. began by assuming muscle pressure as a function of time to be a single
sinusoidal pulse:

pmus = pmax sin(2πft),
= 0,

0<t<

1
2f

t < 0 and t >

(4.4.54)
1
2f

where pmus = muscle pressure, N/m2
pmax = maximum muscle pressure amplitude, N/m2
f = respiratory frequency, breaths/sec
t = time, sec
A simple mechanical description of the respiratory system was assumed:
RdV/dt + V/C = pmus

(4.4.55)

where R = resistance, N·sec/m2
C = compliance, m5/N
V = lung volume, m3
The resulting airflow is thus
VD = dV/dt = (pmax /R) sinθ [cos(2π f t – θ)

–(cosθ)exp(–2π f t / tan θ)]

(4.4.56)

where θ = phase angle between applied pressure and resting flow, rad
θ = tan–1 (2π fRC)

(4.4.57)

Adding a small resistance, ∆R, would change the phase angle to θR:
θR = tan–1[2 π f C(R + ∆R)]

(4.4.58)

Mahutte et al. assumed that resistive load detection occurs if a critical change occurs in phase
angle. That is, if θR – θ) ≥ θcrit,
tan–1[2π f (R + ∆R) C] – tan–1[2π fRC] ≥ θcrit

(4.4.59)

(4.4.60a)
(4.4.60b)

The just-noticeable added resistance must satisfy the preceding equation.
Mahutte et al. added another insight to their model. This phase angle can be detected by a
time difference, and since we know the brain contains a sense of time, probably resulting from
a neural oscillator and a counter mechanism,89 the just-noticeable additional resistance could
possibly be detected by a time delay schema. Use of the following reasonable values of
respiratory parameters:

R
C
f
∆R/R

= 294 kN·sec/m5(3cm H2O·sec/L)
= 980 kN/m5(10 cm H2O/L)
= 0.27 breath/sec (16 breaths/min)
= 0.3

give θcrit = 0.11 rad (6.5o), or a critical delay time of 0.08–0.1 sec. The authors discuss this
result as highly reasonable in view of experimental observations on neural circuit times.
This model also predicts (Figure 4.4.14) a nonconstant ratio of just-noticeable added
resistance to previously existing resistance (∆R/R). This is an interesting result, one which has
been observed with biological threshold phenomena (Weber–Fechner law) other than
resistance detection,90 but which has yet to be confirmed with added respiratory resistance.
89
0r, more likely, it result from the potentiation of a neural outburst by summation of many subthreshold transmembrane
potentials.
90
For instance, the sensitivity to sound level has a characteristic similar to the shape in Figure 4.4.14.


293

Model results also predict an effect of respiratory compliance on ∆R/R, which, again, has yet
to be experimentally confirmed.
4.4.2 Gas Concentration Models

The objective of these models is to reproduce the distribution of various gas species within the
respiratory gas-conduction passages, and to demonstrate the dependence of this distribution on
the respiratory mechanical properties considered in previous models. Visser and Luijendijk
(1982) presented a drawing of an old Chinese model (Figure 4.4.15) which incorporates nine
bronchial segments and six lobes. They indicated that at that time divisibility by 3 was more
important than reality for the number of elements of a model. More modern models have
certainly reproduced reality much better than the old Chinese model and, because of this, have
come to be depended upon for predictions that cannot be easily measured.
Concentration Dynamics Model. The one model to be considered in detail involves
pulmonary mechanics and gas concentration dynamics in a nonlinear model (Lutchen et al.,
1982). The objective of this model is to show how mechanical parameters of the lung produce
pendelluft, the distribution of dead volume gas to other lung compartments, the distribution of
compartmental resting and tidal volumes, and differences in compartmental gas
concentrations.
This model begins with a multicompartmental analysis of the lung, as seen in Figure
4.4.16. The three distinct compartments are the conducting airway and dead volume (1) and
two parallel alveolar compartments (2 and 3). Each alveolar compartment is assumed to
possess perfect gas mixing and to vary in volume. The dead space compartment does not
possess gas mixing during flow-that is, gas flow through the dead volume occurs as a slug of
gas displaces the previously resident gas-and is of constant volume. There is a mixing point at
the common junction of all three compartments where gas from the dead volume mixes with
gas in the alveolar compartments. Effects of gas compression are neglected and only inert,
insoluble tracer gases which take no part in alveolar-capillary transport are considered. Only

small tidal volumes (compared to end-expiratory volume) and low breathing rates (less than 1
breath/sec) are considered.
Because dead volume is assumed to be constant, lung volume changes occur only by
means of changes in the alveolar compartments, or
VDL = VD2 + VD3

(4.4.61)

VDL = total lung flow rate, m3/sec
VDi = flow rate into compartment, i, m3/sec
A pressure balance on the model yields

where

ptp = (pao – pm) + (pm – ppl)

(4.4.62)

where ptp = transpulmonary pressure, N/m2
pao = pressure at the airway opening, N/m2
ppl = pleural pressure, N/m2
To describe each pressure difference appearing on the right-hand side of Equation 4.4.62,
relatively simple yet nonlinear impedances were used. Considering the upper airways to be
rigid (no compliance) and breathing rates to be low (negligible inertance) gives
(pao – pm) = Ruaw VDL

(4.4.63)

where Ruaw constant upper airway resistance, N·sec/m5
Pressure drop across each alveolar compartment was assumed to depend on resistance and
compliance. Resistance of the peripheral airways within these alveolar compartments is
assumed to be inversely related to compartment volume (see Section 4.2.3):

Rlaw = ri/Vi
where Rlaw = lower airway resistance for compartment i, N·sec/m5
ri = specific resistance of compartment i, N·sec/m2
Vi = volume of each compartment, m3

(4.4.64)


295

An exponential equation form was used to describe the elastic behavior of the lung parenchyma:

Ci = Vi /[hi exp(Vi/εi)]

(4.4.65)

where C i = compartment compliance, m5/N
h i = pressure coefficient, N/m2
εi = volume coefficient, m3
Transpulmonary pressure becomes

ptp = Ruaw VDL + ri VDi / Vi + hi exp(Vi/ εi)

(4.4.66)

Transpulmonary pressure will be used as the input forcing function causing flow into or out
from compartments. This flow becomes

(4.4.67a)

(4.4.67b)

Two forms for the forcing function were used. The one giving values closest to most reported
results consists of a periodic exponential rise and exponential fall:
ptp = p0 + p{1 – exp[–(t – te(k))] /τr},

te(k) ≤ t ≤ ti(k)

(4.4.68a)

ptp = p0 + P exp{– [t – ti(k)] /τf},

ti(k) ≤ t ≤ te(k + 1)

(4.4.68b)

where p0 = pressure constant, N/m2
P = pressure factor, N/m2
te(k) = starting time for expiration k, sec
ti(k) = starting time for inspiration k, sec
τr = time constant of pressure rise, sec
τf = time constant of pressure fall, sec
Using values listed in Table 4.4.4, the inspiratory time was 2.67 sec, expiratory time was 1.33
sec, and respiration rate was 0.25 breath/sec.
The transpulmonary pressure was also simulated using a sinusoid:
ptp = p0 + Ps[1 – cos(2πft)]

(4.4.69)

where Ps = sinusoidal pressure factor, N/m2
f = breathing frequency, breaths/sec
Gas transport equations were developed for the inert tracer gas. Axial diffusion is
neglected and plug transport occurs in the dead volume. Therefore, the volume of gas
entering at the airway opening does not reach the mixing point (at the junction of
compartments 1, 2 and 3) until after a time delay. For the first breath of the tracer gas,

Equation 4.4.70 thus states that the concentration of gas at the mixing point does not change
from the initial lung concentration unless a sufficient change in lung volume clears old gases
from the dead volume.
Similarly, during expiration, the first gas delivered to the airway opening has the input
concentration of the tracer gas. If the input gas had reached the mixing point during the

Ventilation of both alveolar compartments may not be in synchrony or in the same
direction, thus leading to pendelluft. There are six possible directions of flow among the
conducting airway and alveolar compartments. A mass balance at the mixing point gives

and during expiration,

Lutchen et al. (1982) used their model to investigate the effects of mechanical parameters
on concentration differences between the two compartments and to determine the effects of
pendelluft on concentration differences. They considered the standard nitrogen washout
maneuver for normal mechanical property values (equal time constants) and values
corresponding to obstructive pulmonary conditions. The nitrogen washout procedure consists
of suddenly breathing pure oxygen and recording the decline in nitrogen concentration
accompanying each succeeding exhalation. By determining the total amount of nitrogen
exhaled, the functional residual capacity of the lung can be calculated.
In Figure 4.4.17 is seen flow, volume, and concentration during multibreath nitrogen
washout for the uniform (normal) lung model. The double exponential pressure forcing
function was used to achieve these results. The decrease of nitrogen concentration with time
can be seen.
A nonuniform, obstructive lung was simulated by increasing R3, h3, and ε3, This caused
the mechanical time constant RC of compartment 3 to be much larger than that of
compartment 2. A considerable amount of pendelluft occurs, and the nitrogen concentration in
compartment 2 is always less than the concentration in compartment 3. Because compartment
3 is slower to empty than compartment 2, there is a distinct rise in nitrogen concentration
during each exhalation (Figure 4.4.18).
An interesting result shown by the Lutchen et al. model is that there is a natural
compensation for the concentration effects which accompany compartments with unequal
time constants. The unobstructed compartment with the smaller time constant fills faster, but
the first air to enter the compartment is dead volume air. Dead volume air is largely made of
air from the slower emptying compartment with the higher nitrogen concentration. Thus


298

Figure 4.4.17 Flow, volume, and concentration dynamics during multibreath nitrogen washout for the
uniform (normal) model. Normalized nitrogen concentrations are shown for the airway opening and for
alveolar compartments 1 and 2. The alveolar compartment outputs are identical. On inspiration, alveolar
concentration is shown as the dotted line and is distinct from airway opening concentration, shown as a
solid line. (Adapted and used with permission from Lutchen et al., 1982. © 1982 IEEE.)

a large portion of the air filling the faster compartment does not dilute the air in that
compartment as much as it would have if the dead volume air had been evenly distributed. On
the other hand, the slower filling compartment fills mostly with fresh air, which has filled the
dead volume compartment after the stale air largely filled the faster compartment. Thus air in
the slower compartment is diluted more than it would be otherwise. Pendelluft flow between
compartments further reduces concentration differences between them.
There are other cases studied by the authors, and further clinical significance which they
discuss. The significance of this model, however, is that respiratory dysfunction can be easily
modeled and respiratory parameters normally inaccessible can be closely watched. Because
some model assumptions preclude application of these results to exercise, a model to
investigate similar parameters during exercise would require further complexity.
4.5 RESPIRATORY CONTROL MODELS

Models of respiratory control are abundant. Many models have been proposed which proceed
from a premise of material balances. These models seek to define respiratory control in terms
of the maintenance of blood property homeostasis. They may involve removal of excess
carbon dioxide, return of blood acidity to normal levels, or resupply of hemoglobin oxygen

(obstructive) model. Normalized N2 concentrations are shown for the airway opening and for alveolar
compartments 1 and 2. The obstructive model demonstrates clearly different behavior from the normal
model. (Adapted and used with permission from Lutchen et al., 1982. © 1982 IEEE.)

saturation. They propose mechanisms by which experimental results are recreated. In general,
the output of these models is respiratory ventilation. They are seldom concerned with
respiratory details more minute than ventilation.
Contrarily, there is a large set of models which begin with a ventilation requirement and
are concerned with the prediction of such variables as respiration rate, ratio of inhalation time
to exhalation time, and breathing waveshape. This class of models proceeds along the line of
parameter optimization.
In both control model types, there are strong appearances of elements of the respiratory
mechanical models reviewed earlier (Section 4.4). For the most part, respiratory mechanical
properties are included in a very rudimentary fashion, usually including constant resistances
and compliances and one lung compartment. This is necessary because most model
mathematics become extremely complicated once more realistic mechanical properties are
included.
In this section, several of the more important models are reviewed. Degrees of similarity
appear, but differences have been the cause for discussion in the field.
4.5.1

System Models

There are several models that encompass the entire respiratory system, including the
controlled system and respiratory controller. The two major models presented here have been
used as the basis for further model refinements.


300

Grodins Model. Of the models included in this book, the Grodins model (Grodins et al.,
1967) is probably the most complex. Yet it will be clear that many simplifications were
included in the model, and correction of these is the aim of later work (e.g., Saunders et al.,
1980). The model has existed in several forms, each a variant or improvement of those
coming before. The version reviewed here was published in 1967 and has been the object of
much subsequent work. This version was still subject to variation when it was published, and
its authors left no doubt that there were still significant imperfections in the model. Grodins
(1981) indicated that whereas some modern models satisfactorily reproduce respiration and
gas inhalation at rest, no model has yet to satisfactorily reproduce exercise effects.
The model of Grodins et al. (1967) was split into two components: (1) a controlled
system, called the plant or process, and (2) a controller. Of the two, the controlled system was
far more fully described.
The controlled system comprised three major compartments: the lung, brain, and tissue,
connected by circulating blood (Figure 4.5.1). Blood gas pressures in arterial blood leaving
the lung were assumed to equal alveolar pressures in the expired air. Total oxygen content of
arterial blood is the sum of physically dissolved and oxyhemoglobin components (see Section
3.2.1). Similarly, the total carbon dioxide content of the blood consists of dissolved CO2 and
that chemically incorporated into blood bicarbonate, carboxyhemoglobin, and other blood
proteins. Nitrogen is present exclusively in dissolved form. Gas partial pressures in each
compartment were assumed constant and equal to those in exiting venous blood.
Following a transport delay, which depends on vascular volume and blood flow rate,
arterial blood arrives from the lungs at brain or tissue compartments. Oxygen is removed from
the blood and carbon dioxide added according to metabolic rate. Addition of carbon dioxide
can change blood bicarbonate concentration, which, in turn, can influence pH.

Figure 4.5.1 Schematic diagram for the Grodins et al. (1967) respiratory control model. The lung is
assumed to have one-way airflow. Two other compartments are the brain (with CSF subcompartment)
and body tissue. All compartments are linked through the cardiovascular system. (Used with permission
from Grodins et al., 1967.)


301

The brain compartment is separated from a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) section by a
semipermeable membrane passing respiratory gases only. These diffuse across the membrane
at rates proportional to their pressure gradients. Unlike the brain blood section, the CSF
section contains no protein capable of buffering carbonic acid. The CSF section bicarbonate
content is assumed to remain constant at all CO2 pressures above 1333 N/m2 (10 mm Hg).
Venous blood leaving the brain and blood leaving the tissue combine, after appropriate
time delays, to form mixed venous blood. After another delay, this blood enters the lung to
complete the circle of gas transport.
The lungs were regarded as a box of constant volume, uniform content, and zero dead
space. This box was ventilated by a continuous unidirectional stream of gas. There was no
cyclic respiratory movement or change in gas composition.
Total cardiac output and local brain flow vary as functions of arterial CO2 and oxygen
partial pressures. Since circulatory delays are functions of blood flow, delay times were
treated as dependent variables.
The controller was not described in terms of its physical details of receptors, locations,
neural pathways, and muscles, but instead was described as consisting of a chemical
concentration input transferred into a ventilation output. Controller equations were not given
in much detail, probably because correct equations were not exactly known.
System equations begin with material balance equations for carbon dioxide, oxygen, and
nitrogen for each of the three compartments of lung, brain, and tissue. For the lung,

carbamino hemoglobin, and physical solution. In addition, there is an interaction between
carbon dioxide-carrying capacity of the hemoglobin and oxygen saturation, called the Haldane
effect. The carbon dioxide balance between systemic arteries and alveoli gives

Arterial concentrations of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen at the entrance of the
brain and tissue reservoirs are determined in terms of their concentrations in pulmonary
venous (systemic arterial) blood leaving the lung. Because there is a delay between the time
blood leaves the lung and arrival at each compartment, the appropriate gas concentration at
the lung appeared at a previous time, prior to its arrival in each compartment:

first segment. If τaB1 is considered to be the time required to pass through the arteries serving
only the brain, then (τaB – τaB1) is the time required for blood, which eventually reaches the
brain, to pass through the common segment. In the venous direction, τvB1 is considered to be
the time spent in the common segment, and (τvb – τvB1) is the time to pass through those veins
draining blood exclusively from the brain compartment. Another delay time, τao, is the lung to
carotid body delay time and is required for use in the controller equations:

receptors.
Grodins et al. (1967) rearranged the preceding equations and solved the resulting
equations on a digital computer. Solution of these equations was not entirely straightforward
because there are variable time lags in each of these.
Several versions of the model were described by Grodins et al. (1967). The final version
includes the CSF compartment and delay time values calculated from past-average blood
flows. These inclusions are presented in equations previously given.
The authors subjected their model to normal conditions as well as hypoxia at sea level,
hypoxia at altitude, inhalation of carbon dioxide, and metabolic acidosis. The hyperpnea of
exercise could not be reproduced.
Normal values of constants not already included in the equations are given in Table 4.5.1.
In Figure 4.5.2 is shown the response of the model to a 5% CO2 pulse. The model gives an
initial rapid rise in ventilation followed by a slower rise toward a steady-state value, similar to
experimental results.
Since the formulation of the model by Grodins et al. (1967), other attempts have been
made to provide more satisfying solutions to the problem of identification of respiratory
control mechanisms. The problem was stated succinctly by Grodins (1981). If arterial partial
pressure (paCO2) is considered to be the stimulus to alveolar ventilation rates, then an increase

in carbon dioxide production during exercise ( VCO 2 ) or an increase in inhaled carbon dioxide
(FiCO2) will increase paCO2, and alveolar ventilation would be stimulated. Because this is
assumed to be a proportional controller, there would be some steady-state error remaining
after the increase, and the error would be inversely related to controlled gain. This is a very
attractive explanation for exercise hyperpnea.
Unfortunately, if the controller gain is estimated from its response to carbon dioxide
inhalation at rest, the error observed in moderate exercise is not nearly enough to account for
the ventilation. A method of circumventing this problem is to add a term to the controller
equation which is proportional to VCO 2 . Now, alveolar ventilation rate will increase and paCO2
will remain at its resting level. Nevertheless, this mathematical solution may have no basis in
physiological reality.
Saunders Modification of Grodins Model. Saunders et al. (1980) went in a different
direction. They modified the Grodins et al. (1967) model to include cyclic ventilation,
respiratory dead volume, variable lung volume, blood shunting past the lung, a separate
muscle compartment, and a different controller equation (Figure 4.5.3). They deleted the
separate CSF compartment of Grodins et al. (1967).
Lung volume was assumed to comprise alveolar volume and dead volume. In turn, dead

Myoglobin is an iron-containing pigment in red muscles which resembles hemoglobin but binds one, rather than four, moles
of O2 per mole of myoglobin. Its dissociation curve is a rectangular hyperbolic shape rather than the sigmoid shape of
hemoglobin. Since the myoglobin dissociation curve is placed to the left of the hemoglobin dissociation curve, myoglobin
absorbs oxygen from hemoglobin. Myoglobin content is greatest in muscles specialized for sustained contraction, and its
purpose seems to be a small reservoir of oxygen to be used when external oxygen supply through the blood is severely limited
(Ganong, 1963).

(Cunningham, 1974) and include interaction between hypoxia and hypercapnia (see Equation

oxygen and carbon dioxide. Average partial pressures were used after filtering with a secondorder digital filter.

Saunders et al. (1980) tested their model with several different situations, including
increased inspired CO2 fraction, step increase in mixed venous blood CO2 concentration,
hypoxic gas mixtures, CO2 rebreathing, exercise, and breath-holding during exercise. Mixed
results were obtained, with the worst results for exercise simulation.
Exercise was simulated by an abrupt increase in oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide
production in the muscle compartment together with an appropriate increase in cardiac output.
To maintain numerical stability, the muscle myoglobin oxygen storage reservoir had to be
maintained at 4 x 10-4 m3 (400 mL). At a simulation level of 100 N·m/sec, the model again
failed with a negative muscle pO2.The main responsible factor proved to be that ventilation
increased too slowly to maintain sufficient oxygen supply in arterial blood during the transient
period following the onset of exercise. To restore numerical stability, the controller gain
dealing with carbon dioxide had to be increased fivefold, the blood shunt fraction had to be
reduced from 5% to 1%, and blood had to be diverted from the other tissue to the muscle
compartment if muscle pO2 fell to 0.667 N/M2 (5 mm Hg).
Even with numerical stability achieved, the resulting transients for paCO2 and ventilation
were far from realistic (Figure 4.5.4), showing a lag of about 6 sec with a marked overshoot in
ventilation and oscillation in paCO2.
Saunders (1980) used the previous model to propose and test a simple, elegant, and
apparently successful explanation for the hyperpnea of exercise and elevated carbon dioxide
breathing. As previously mentioned, Yamamoto (1960) had drawn attention to the amplitude
of oscillations of arterial CO2 partial pressure (paCO2). Because paCO2 can decrease only
during inspiration, there is a recurring oscillation of paCO2 which has a period dependent on
the respiration rate. The amplitude of this oscillation increases during exercise (CO2 loading
via the mixed venous blood) and decreases during CO2 inhalation (CO2 loading via the lungs).
That there is a large difference in respiratory response to these two sources of CO2 loading,
with exercise provoking a rapid increase in ventilation followed by a slower rise toward the
steady state (see Section 4.3.4), and CO2 inhalation provoking a much slower rise in
ventilation, has stimulated thought that the amplitude of oscillations could provide
information to the controller beyond that provided by the mean paCO2 alone.


316

Figure 4.5.4 Sudden onset of exercise of 100 N·m/sec at zero time. Note the increased CO2 oscillations
after the transient, due to the increased CO2 inflow in venous blood. (Adapted and used with permission
from Saunders et. al., 1980.)

Saunders (1980) demonstrated that it is not the amplitude of the oscillations but rather the
rate of rise of paCO2 with time that could provide the necessary controller information. The
general shape of paCO2 oscillations is seen in Figure 4.5.5. The rising limb of the CO2
oscillation occupies more than half the cycle because of dead volume and respiratory
waveshape. The rate of rise is almost constant during the rising limb. The magnitude of the
rate of rise depends on the size of the dead volume, breathing waveshape, and the respiration
rate. These effects have been seen experimentally as well as analytically (Saunders, 1980).
Saunders (1980) proposed that the rate of rise93 of paCO2, (dpaCO2)/dt), be considered the
important controller signal. In view of the many neural receptors which are sensitive to both a
stimulus level and a rate of rise of the stimulus, this hypothesis appears to be physiologically
sound.
93

Saunders actually considers the maximum rate of rise of arterial CO2 partial pressure to be the controller stimulus. Since the
rate of rise is nearly constant, there will be little difference between maximum and instantaneous rates.


317

Figure 4.5.5 The general shape of pCO2 oscillations obtained at rest (left) and at 100 N·m/sec (right).
The ascending limb with slope ∆pCO2/∆t occupies two-thirds of the cycle in both cases. From left to
right, tidal volumes are 63 x 10-5 m3 (0.63 L) and 170 x 10-5 m3 (1.7 L) and respiration rates are 0.187/sec
(11.2/min) and 0.343/sec (20.6/min). (Adapted and used with permission from Saunders, 1980.)

Saunders then proposed that this stimulus be incorporated within a feedforward94 loop not
so much to maintain mean arterial pCO2 at a constant level of 5333 N/m2 (40 mm Hg) seen
during exercise as to remove excess metabolic CO2. The ventilation required to maintain paCO2
at a level of 5333 N/m2 is related to the rate of rise of paCO2 during the oscillation by the
feedforward controller equation:
V = 7.00 x 10-7 (dpa CO 2 / dt )

(4.5.98)

where V = average ventilation rate, m3/sec
(dpaCO2)/dt = rate of rise of arterial CO2 partial pressure, N/(m2·sec)
which is a simple linear relationship.
Using only the feedforward equation (4.5.98) and the controlled system described in
94

Saunders (1980) gave a clear explanation for the difference between feedforward and feedback control: "If we start with the
purpose of maintaining isocapnia, it is natural to start thinking in terms of negative feedback. If however we start with the
purpose of eliminating a CO2 load with maximal efficiency, we may think of a different approach. Thus, an engineering plant
controller, faced with a sudden increase in raw material to process, recruits extra staff and mobilizes spare machinery. If done
well, supplies of rate-limiting components and energy sources will remain constant, and the output of processed material will
match the input. In the respiratory system also, faced with a sudden need to process CO2, the effective mechanism is a direct
coupling to the elimination rate." A feedback plant controller would have reduced the CO2 load which the plant processes by
accumulating CO2 somewhere near the input.


318

Saunders et al. (1980), and with no feedback whatsoever, the system remained stable, mean
paCO2 remained at 5426 N/m2 with a somewhat irregular tidal volume showing an occasional
deep breath (Figure 4.5.6). Such irregularity in tidal volume is a characteristic of natural
breathing.
Circulation time delays can be calculated by the simple process of dividing the volume of
the relevant circulation segment by the instantaneous flow rate. However, for rapid changes in
flow rate, such as those which accompany the onset of exercise, this approach is incorrect, and
the procedure described by Grodins et al. (1967) had to be used.
Using this approach, the delay time between lung and controller (assumed to be in the
proximity of the carotid body) has been calculated. The effect of doubling cardiac output on
paCO2 oscillations is shown in Figure 4.5.7. It can be seen that even before the blood reaches
the controller site, the rate of rise of paCO2 increases. The chemical signal can travel faster
than the blood flow!
Saunders (1980) modified the feedforward equation (4.5.98) somewhat to match real data
better, which resulted in
-7
-5
V = 7.69 x 10 (dpaCO2/dt) – 1.67 x 10

(4.5.99)

The resulting simulated exercise ventilation at 100 N·m/sec is shown in Figure 4.5.8. It can be
seen that the abrupt increase in breathing, followed by the slow rise to steady state, is
simulated well even without explicit neural input.
Finally, a controller to simulate both exercise and CO2 breathing incorporated the resting
controller Equations (4.5.97a–4.5.97c) and the feedforward Equation (4.5.99):

V = Equation 4.5.97 + Equation 4.5.99 - 1.23 x 10

Figure 4.5.9 Steady-state results for ventilation and arterial pCO2 from the model with controller
equation (4.5.100). A = resting point: AB = 4% CO2 breathing; AC = 50 N·m/sec exercise; BD = 4% CO2
breathing with superimposed 50 N·m/sec exercise and inspired CO2 inflow rate constant; BE = 4% CO2
breathing with superimposed exercise at 50 N·m/sec. (Adapted and used with permission from Saunders,
1980.)

The resulting controller performance is seen in Figure 4.5.9. Resting response to increased
inspired CO2 is given by AB. The transition between rest and exercise is given by AC and is
isocapnic within 133 N/m2. Exercise plus inhaled CO2 gives the response represented by CE.
Notice that exercise response to inhaled CO2 occurs at the same slope as resting CO2 response,
with an apparent shift in intercept. Indeed, this hypothesized respiratory controller is
consistent with many of the experimental observations that have been so difficult to reproduce
in other models (Allen and Jones, 1984).
Yamamoto CO2 Model This model was formulated explicitly to reproduce classic
experiments in respiratory control: those by Kao (1963), Yamamoto and Edwards (1960),
Greco et al. (1978), and Ponte and Purves (1978). The model is somewhat simpler than the
model of Grodins et al. (1967) because the only gas considered was carbon dioxide (oxygen
was ignored and hydrogen ions were replaced by CO2), and there is no explicit cerebrospinal
fluid compartment. This model (Yamamoto, 1978, 1981) does, however, show a steady-state
hyperpnea to CO2 introduced at the tissues, with no concomitant rise in mean arterial carbon
dioxide partial pressure, and it shows a steady-state hyperpnea to inhaled carbon dioxide
which involves a proportionate increase in mean paCO2
The basic model, formulated for a normal man, includes the two large components of a
controlled system and a controlling system (Figure 4.5.10). The controlled system includes
lung, brain, and peripheral tissues. Each of these, in turn, consists of a cellular space, an
extracellular space, and a capillary blood volume. For the lung, however, the alveolar space is
equivalent to the cellular space of tissue. Lung tissue is treated as a single compartment
interposed between capillary and gas. The lung gas space consists of alveolar and dead spaces.


321

Figure 4.5.10 Organization of the Yamamoto CO2 model.

Respiratory drive is computed as a hypothetical muscle pressure which must overcome
thoracic and airway impedances to expand or contract alveolar volume.
Components of the controlled system are connected by a branched first-in-first-out file
representing the circulating blood. It is in this manner that circulatory delays are incorporated
within the model (Figure 4.5.11). There are 100 elements to this file, with each element
representing 60 x 10-6 m3 of blood (and total systemic blood volume of 6 x 10-3 m3 blood).
Blood gas values are contained in these elements, and they slowly and sequentially make their
ways from one point in the system to another. As cardiac output increases, the volume of
blood in each element remains constant, but the transit time decreases. Shifts in blood volume
are thus not included. At rest the total transit time is 0.6 sec (cardiac output = 1.0 x 10-4
m3/sec), but at an elevated cardiac output of 3.3 x 10-4 m3/sec, transit time decreases to 0.18
sec. In all cases, total transit time is represented by 100 cycles of computation (100 Tb).
The site of the respiratory controller is assumed to be the brain. The circulatory branch to
the respiratory controller is a sequential subfile whose origin is determined by the volumetric
distance of the brain from the heart. Mixed venous blood is produced by the merger of brain
and peripheral tissue blood flows.

Respiratory drive represents the envelope of neural impulses in the motor nerves of
respiration. It is chosen to be a trapezoidal waveshape that switches from inhalation to
exhalation at 0.45 times the respiratory period. Magnitude and frequency of this signal are
computed from the CO2 level of the blood. The frequency drive is calculated from the
amplitude by95

(4.5.119)

where F(nTb) = frequency signal for the respiratory drive, dimensionless
A(nTb) = amplitude signal for the respiratory drive, dimensionless
n = number of breaths, dimensionless
Since A and F are functions of nTb, time has been assumed to advance in quanta. That is, the
amplitude and frequency drives do not change during the circulatory time but only between
computation times (at time= nTb). Also, since the amplitude signal A(nTb) is summed in
Equation 4.5.119, the frequency drive has memory: frequency depends somewhat on previous
values of amplitude.
The respiratory drive during inspiratory effort is
R(nTb) = 0.7A(nTb) + 0.6F(nTb) A(nTb),

0 < F(nTb) ≤ 0.45

where R(nTb) = computed respiratory drive, N/m2
During expiration it is
R(nTb) = A(nTb)[0.5 – 0.8 F(nTb)]

(4.5.121)

Expiration required active muscular effort at all levels of CO2 excitation. Forcing expiration to
be passive was found to change the model behavior only a little.
The equation describing A(nTb) is the controller equation, and it was this relationship that
was the object of study for Yamamoto (1978). The controlling system was assumed to be that

The form X MOD Y is abbreviated notation for modulo arithmetic. The value for X MOD Y is the remainder after X is divided

part of the brain which was concerned with respiration. For an assumed brain mass of 1.4 kg,
only 5% (70 g) was assumed to participate in the controller. This brain tissue itself required
description by tissue material balance equations (4.5.101-4.5.103). For this portion of the
brain, resting blood flow and metabolism were scaled to 5% of those appearing in Table 4.5.2.
Yamamoto (1978) assumed that increased neural output from the brain controller region
was accompanied by an increase in local metabolism, with a concomitant increase in carbon
dioxide production. An increase in respiratory center activity did not result in a general
increase in CO2 production of the whole brain. The relation between neural activity and CO2
production is given by

= 9.73 x 10–5 – (5.83 x 10–3) MD B + 5.00 x 10–6 A(nTb)

where MD B = brain CO2 production rate, m3/sec
Carbon dioxide production was calculated to be 3.85 x 10-5 m3 STPD/sec. Yamamoto (1978)
discusses in greater detail the origin of the coefficient values.
Respiratory controller blood flow was assumed to exhibit the same dependence on
arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure as does the entire brain. Rather than use the equations
(4.5.50a and b) by Grodins et al. (1967), Yamamoto chose to fit experimental data
quadratically. These equations were then scaled to 70 g of brain tissue.

p(nTb) = arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure evaluated in discrete time, N/m2
This computation occurs in discrete, or quantized, time, and spaced one circulatory
computation time (T) apart.
To introduce a first-order temporal response into vascular changes, Yamamoto (1978)
computed blood flow with a first-order difference equation:
Q B′ ( nTb ) = 0.85 Q B [(n −1)] + 0.15 Q B (nTb )

(4.5.124)

where Q B′ ( nTb ) = actual blood flow at time = nTb, m /sec
Under resting conditions this is approximately equivalent to a first-order differential equation
with a time constant of 4.2 sec.
The nature of the control mechanism was postulated by Yamamoto (1978) as consisting
of three contributing components:
3

1. A term linearly proportional to brain extracellular carbon dioxide partial pressure.
2. A term linearly related to the transmembrane gradient of CO2 in the neuron.
3. A term linearly related to the difference between the present value of paCO2 and the
average value of paCO2 some time ago.
The first term represents the generally accepted view that cerebrospinal fluid is important in
respiratory control; the second term gives a gradient detector without a fixed set point,

model. Two responses are clearly obtained depending on the means of CO2 introduction. Metabolically
produced CO2 elicits an isocapnic response with almost infinite sensitivity. Inhaled CO2 elicits
ventilation proportional to pCO2 within an experimentally determined high- and low-sensitivity range.

which accentuates transient response; and the third term incorporates a time-variant signal into
the controller.
A(nTb) = 3.2(pBe – 6079) + 51.0(pBi – pBe) + 2.0[Raa(0) – Raa(H)]

pBi = brain intracellular CO2 partial pressure, N/m2
Raa(t) = autocovariance function evaluated at time lag t, dimensionless96
H = delay constant in equivalent file locations, dimensionless
96
The autocovariance function determines the variation of a signal with itself when delayed by some time interval. A periodic
signal will display a periodic autocovariance function. A nonperiodic signal will usually display some monotonically decreasing
autocovariance function with maximum value (of 1.0) appearing at a time delay of 0.0. The autocovariance term was used here
to give a moving difference value and was calculated from

2.0 {paCO2 (nTb) - paCO2 [(n – H)Tb]}2
Values of paCO2 used were in the current cerebral arteriolar position and the one in the cerebral artery H computational cycles
earlier in the first-in-first-out file.

Figure 4.5.13 Model responses over an extended range of arterial pCO2. Both metabolic CO2 (vertical
lines) and inhaled CO2 (inclined lines) produce a dog-leg characteristic. (Adapted and used with
permission from Yamamoto, 1978.)

Yamamoto used delay values of 1.26 and 1.19 sec, which gave different file location
sequences.
Results from the model are seen in Figure 4.5.12. Response to metabolic CO2 production
is isocapnic, whereas response to CO2 inhalation falls within the range of experimental
observations which are described as proportional. The cusp in the model results for CO2
inhalation is ascribed to the inability of the circulatory file to produce a constant value of the
delay constant H. More circulatory segments would presumably alleviate the problem. From
the standpoint that the model met the judgement criteria for metabolic and inhaled CO2, it
appears to be successful.
Yamamoto (1981) modified this model in order to reproduce some experimental
observations that show that an isocapnic response is not always solicited in response to
intravenous CO2 loading. He was able to demonstrate, with the modified model, a CO2
response that includes the dog-leg, or hockey-stick, characteristic previously described (see
Section 4.3.4). These model results are shown in Figure 4.5.13.
With similar objectives, Swanson and Robbins (1986) investigated two optimal controller
structures which also predict isocapnic response to metabolic CO2 load and nonisocapnic
response to inspired CO2 load. In these structures, cost functionals with two terms (one
involving the cost associated with maintaining an arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure at a
set point and the other involving the excess cost of breathing) were minimized for controller
operation. Direct comparison to the Yamamoto model has not been made, but it is clear that
all three of these models are at least partially successful in reproducing exercise ventilatory
effects.

4.5.2

Fujihara Control Model

Fujihara et al. (1973a, b) experimentally applied a series of impulse, step, and ramp work
loads to subjects pedaling a bicycle ergometer. Work rates were changed silently, and without
warning. The range of work loads studied was 33–360 N·m/sec.
By changing work rates with impulse inputs, especially, Fujihara et al. were able to
distinguish between a set of competing models to describe respiratory transient responses. The
model that best described their experimental data is
∆VDE ( S ) =

AE − stD1
Be − st D 2
+
(1 + sτ 1 ) (1 + sτ 2 )(1 + sτ 3 )

(4.5.126)

where ∆VDE ( S ) = change in minute ventilation, m3/sec
A, B = constants, m3/sec
tD1, tD2 = time delays, sec
τ1, τ2, τ3 = time constants, sec
s = complex Laplace transform parameter,97 sec–1
This transfer function has a time response to an impulse work load as in Figure 4.5.14 (left)
and to a step input work load as in Figure 4.5.14 (right). This function provides for the rapid
and slower ventilatory responses to abrupt exercise described earlier (see Section 4.3.4), but it
also exhibits no identifiable fast response to high levels of exercise when made abruptly
higher (Bennett et al., 1981).
Estimates of parameters appearing in Equation 4.5.126 are listed in Table 4.5.3. Fujihara
et al. used mainly unsophisticated graphical techniques for determining these values.
Bennett et al. (198 1) confirmed the form of Equation 4.5.126 as the correct description
of the response of the respiratory system to abrupt changes in ventilatory demand. However,
their findings came as a result of the application of a pseudorandom binary sequence of work
rates between the limits of 25 and 100 N·m/sec to subjects exercising on a bicycle ergometer.
Bennett et al. obtained their parameter estimates (Table 4.5.4) by using autocorrelation and
cross-correlation techniques. Values for tD1 could not be estimated except for subject BB. A
comparison of values between Tables 4.5.3 and 5.5.4 shows a somewhat larger variability in
the values of Bennett et al., but an overall similarity of estimates.

optimization models have been proposed but none have yet been integrated within
comprehensive system models such as the Grodins model or the Yamamoto model. Most of
these models, based on respiratory system mechanics, incorporate only the simplest
respiratory mechanical descriptions. Some, such as the models by Johnson and Masaitis
(1976) and Johnson and McCuen (1980), are special-purpose models directed to explanation
of responses while wearing respiratory protective masks. Others, such as the Yamashiro and
Grodins series (1971, 1973; Yamashiro et al., 1975) and the Hämäläinen series (1973;
Hämäläinen and Sipilä, 1980; Hämäläinen et al., 1978a,c), form connected sets of evolving
complexity. In this section two models are highlighted; the first gives insight into the
differences between breathing at rest and exercise, and the second reestablishes the connection
between rest and exercise.
Yamashlro and Grodins Model. The purpose of the Yamashiro and Grodins (1971)
model was to determine if airflow shape is regulated in an optimal manner. To show this, they
assumed a simple respiratory mechanical system composed of a single constant compliance
and single constant resistance. Expiration was assumed to be passive and contributed nothing
to the calculation of respiratory work.
Yamashiro and Grodins assumed that airflow rate can be described by an infinite Fourier
series:

VD = ∑ ai sin (iω t )

where VD = airflow, m3/sec
ai = Fourier coefficients, m3/sec

(1971).

And these Fourier coefficients correspond to a rectangular airflow wave of amplitude
2( V D f + V A ) and duration f/2.
The expiratory waveshape for passive exhalation was found by setting respiratory
pressure to zero in Equation 4.5.132. The solution is
V = –[VT /RC] exp [–(t – π/ω)/RC]

(4.5.144)

These optimal waveshapes appear in Figure 4.5.15. There is a great deal of similarity
between these waveshapes and inhalation during exercise and exhalation at rest. Later work
(Johnson and Masaitis, 1976; Ruttimann and Yamamoto, 1972; Yamashiro and Grodins,
1973; Yamashiro et al., 1975) confirms the rectangular waveshape which minimizes
respiratory work rate. The same waveshape can be obtained for both inhalation and exhalation
when exhalation is no longer considered to be passive. These waveshapes are characteristic of
exercise (see Figure 4.3.35).
Resting inspiratory waveforms do not appear to be rectangular in shape but are much
more akin to sinusoids. Yamashiro and Grodins (197 1) investigated this condition as well.
They noted that the inspiratory muscles continue to contract well into expiration, performing
negative work and adding considerably to respiratory inefficiency. Why this should be so is
open to speculation, but Yamashiro and Grodins noted that by slowing the transition to
exhalation, rapid changes in airflow are avoided, and this may have some utility for improved
gas transport in the lungs.
One measure that heavily penalizes high-frequency respiratory components is the meansquared acceleration (MSA). Yamashiro and Grodins obtained the respiratory waveform
which minimized MSA. Acceleration is found by differentiating Equation 4.5.127 with

The first seven harmonics were added together and plotted in Figure 4.5.16. The waveshape is
very nearly a sinusoid,100 and it appears to be similar to resting inspiratory waveshape.
What the Yamashiro and Grodins model has shown is the different natures of respiratory
optimization during rest and exercise. For rest, the inspiratory waveshape generated by
minimizing the mean-squared acceleration appears to be realistic; during exercise, the
inspiratory waveshape generated by minimizing the average respiratory power appears to be
close to reality.
Hämäläinen Model. Although there have been more recent improvements to the
optimization models developed by Hämäläinen (Hämäläinen and Spililä, 1980, 1984), the
100

The waveshape, as generated by Yamashiro and Grodins, was somewhat asymmetrical, with the rise in inspiration faster than
the fall. It was less peaked than a sinusoid. Hämäläinen and Viljanen (1978b) pointed out that the asymmetry was due to the
awkward Fourier series method of solution. For a linear second-order system model, the closed form result is a parabolic arch
for both inspiration and expiration.


336

Figure 4.5.16 Optimal airflow pattern for a minimal mean-squared acceleration criterion. The waveform
is a symmetrical parabolic arch for both inhalation and exhalation (Hämäläinen and Vi1janen, 1978a).
Comparing this waveshape with those in Figure 4.3.35a shows similarity with the inhalation airflow
form. (Adapted and used with permission from Yamashiro and Grodins, 1971.)

model described in Hämäläinen and Viijanen (1978b) is still noteworthy. It is the first published
model that linked the respiratory waveshapes of exercise with those at rest and indicated how the
range of respiratory waveshapes could be predicted using but one unified cost functional.101
Hämäläinen and colleagues began with a very simple mechanical model of the human
respiratory system, which included one constant resistance and one constant compliance term:
p = V/C + R VD

(4.5.154)

where p = total driving pressure produced by the respiratory muscles, N/m2
V = change in lung volume from resting conditions, m3
C = total respiratory compliance, m5/N
R = total respiratory resistance, N·sec/m5
VD = airflow rate, m3/sec

Hämäläinen and Vi1janen proposed two different cost functionals for inhalation and
exhalation. These were proposed because, they argued, the inspiratory muscles continue their
inspiratory action during the initial stages of exhalation. Inspiratory muscles thus perform
negative work during this time. Oxygen consumption of muscles during negative work is
unlike that during positive work, and the direct additional of physical work done by
inspiratory and expiratory muscles therefore is not a satisfactory analog to total oxygen
consumption. They proposed instead that the integral square of the driving pressure should
correlate with the oxygen consumption of exercise. Presumably, there is no expiratory muscle
negative work included in inhalation.
The cost functional for inhalation is
Ji =

(4.5.155)

The cost functional is the penalty function that must be minimized to solve the problem. In the previously described
Yamashiro and Grodins model, the cost functionals were average work rate and mean-squared acceleration (see Section 4.3.4).


337

where Ji = symbolic notation for inspiratory cost functional, m6/sec3
V = rate of change of inspiratory airflow rate, m3sec2

In their model, Hämäläinen and Vi1janen minimized the value of each of these cost
functionals to determine the time course of respiratory airflow. Other possible sources of
variation, such as durations of inspiration and expiration, are presumed known. There are
other optimization models which predict these values (Johnson and Masaitis, 1976; Johnson
and McCuen, 1980; Yamashiro and Grodins, 1973; Yamashiro et al., 1975).
Each of these cost functionals supposedly represents the oxygen consumption of the
respiratory muscles. The second term in Ji includes the product p VDi , or the respiratory muscle
power. The first term in both Ji and Je describes the reduction in muscular efficiency that
accompanies rapid changes in muscular contraction.
Constraints and boundary conditions of this model are

(4.5.157f)
where Vr = lung resting volume, m3
T =respiratory period, sec
The parameters αi and αe are to be considered as individual parameters, which vary from
person to person.
To solve this system of equations, Hämäläinen obtained the following integrand for Ji:

(

Li (V ,V ,V) = V 2 + α i RV 2 + V / C

)

Using the Euler–Lagrange equation,102 the following fourth-order differential equation is
obtained:

The method of calculus of variations is often used to find the function which, over its entire range, minimizes some cost
functional. If there are constraints on the problem, the method of Lagrange multipliers is combined with calculus of variations
to give a set of conditions that must be met by the solution, and from which the solution can he obtained. The problem
eventually reduces to an algebraic problem of solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation. See Appendix 4.2 for further details.

αi and αe is seen. Other parameters appear in Table 4.5.5. As αi increases, inhalation
waveshape tends to rectangular, and as αe increases, exhalation waveshape tends to
exponential.

resistance increases, both inhalation and exhalation become more nearly rectangular.

Compliance is seen, in Figure 4.5.19, to affect only exhalation. The greater the
compliance, the more nearly exponential is the waveshape.
Adding resistance to the respiratory system affects the breathing waveshape similarly to
increasing flow rate (Silverman et al., 1951). Thus we would expect that the increased
hyperpnea of exercise would result in a progression of waveshapes beginning with the nearly
sinusoidal at rest and ending with the nearly rectangular during heavy exercise. This
progression can be seen in the Hämäläinen model as resistance is increased. In this way, the
model has united the waveshapes seen during rest and exercise and has provided indication of
a common explanation for both.
4.5.4

Brief Discussion of Respiratory Control Models

The control models chosen for inclusion illustrate some very interesting, and contrasting,
aspects of respiratory control. The model of Grodins et al. (1967) is not so much a control
model as a system model, and the model did little to elucidate respiratory control mechanisms.
It was left to Saunders (1980) to extend the model to produce reasonable qualitative responses
to exercise, and Saunders did this by describing a respiratory controller located within the
carotid bodies. He postulated a simple feedforward mechanism based on rate of change of
arterial pCO2, and he discovered the amazing result that a humoral signal could travel faster
than the blood it was flowing in. Yamamoto (1978), on the other hand, produced the essentials
of a model which should give reasonable exercise response, but, unlike Saunders' model,
required a respiratory controller within the brain. Models of both Saunders and Yamamoto
were found to be very sensitive to circulatory delays. Because experimental results have
shown that respiratory control actually emanates from at least the two sites of carotid bodies
and brain respiratory center, it is encouraging that both Saunders and Yamamoto did so well
with their models, but it should also be clear that each is probably considering only one side of
the control issue.
The Fujihara model was included because it used experimental results to answer a
specific question about respiratory control. It is very interesting that Bennett et al., coming
from a different direction, converged on the same results. However, these models do not have
the global character of the Saunders and Yamamoto models.


341

The optimization models are very interesting and seem to be headed in the direction of
explaining respiratory phenomena at a very low level. However, they still have the
shortcoming that they are not global in nature, and they have not been assimilated within
overall respiratory control models. The challenge is to incorporate these models within the
upper level models to provide the details of respiratory responses.

LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

In determining the optimum value of some function F(x, y,...,z), there may arise the situation
where some other constraints Gi(x, y,..., z) = Ci must be satisfied by the solution. Here we
consider the optimum of F(x, y,…,z) to be found as an extremum with respect to the variables
x, y,…, z. Any number of constraints Gi(x, y,..., z) = Ci may be imposed, so long as Ci are
constants. A necessary condition for the required extremum is

obtained involving x, y,…, z and λi. These are then solved simultaneously with the equations
Gi(x, y,..., z) = Ci to obtain values of λi. Finally, the same set of equations is solved for the
required values of x, y,..., z. This method is valid only when the Jacobian matrix is not zero

Lagrange multipliers are useful in optimization problems whenever constraints must be
introduced. An example of the use of Lagrange multipliers can be found in Equations
4.5.134–4.5.141 in Section 4.5.3. Here the function F is represented by the average rate of
work WD in Equation 4.5.134. The constraint G is given by the tidal volume relationship in
Equation 4.5.135. By combining these to form F*, Equation 4.5.136 is obtained. The various
derivatives required for solution are obtained in Equations 4.5.137 and 4.5.138, and the value
of the unknown Lagrange multiplier is found in Equation 4.5.141. One derivative Equation
4.5.138 was used to obtain the value for λ, and the other derivative Equation 4.5.137 was used
to find the value of the parameter of interest, f, once λ was known. This f then satisfies both
the original minimization of work rate criterion and the constraint that tidal volume must
remain at a fixed value.

APPENDIX 4.2
METHOD OF CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS

When extreme values of integrals subject to certain constraints are to be found, the method of
calculus of variations is often used. Consider the integral


342

I1 =

x1

∫ F ( x, y, y′) dx
x2

(A4.2.1)

where y′ ≡ dy/dx and F(x, y, y′) is assumed to be known. F(x, y, y′) also has continuous
second-order partial derivatives with respect to the arguments x, y, and y′. We desired to find
the unknown function y = y(x) for which the integral I1 is a minimum. The function y = y(x) is
found with the help of the Euler equation (Sokolnikoff and Redheffer, 1958):
∂F d  ∂F 

that the curve y = y(x) passes through the boundary points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). If the integral

If the integral I1 was subject to an integral constraint,

and the Euler-Lagrange equation

must be satisfied (Weinstock, 1952, p. 20). In this case, once the form for λ is found from
Equation A4.2.10, its value is obtained by substitution into the constraint J.
As an example of this technique, we find the inhalation flow rate required to minimize

Solving the quadratic Equation A4.2.15 for Vi gives
− K1 ± K12 − 3λK 2
Vi =

which is substituted into the constraint Equation 4.2.12 to give

Substituting this value into Equation 4.2.17 and taking the positive square root because
VCi must be positive we have
VCi = VT/ti

(A4.2.20)

Thus the airflow waveshape to minimze inspiratory work is a constant flow rate. Further uses
of this technique can be found in Johnson and Masaitis (1976).
