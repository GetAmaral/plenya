Cardiovascular Responses
The heart, consequently, is the beginning of life, the sun of the microcosm, even as the sun in his
turn might be designated the heart of the world; for it is the heart by whose virtue and pulse the
blood is moved, perfected, made apt to nourish, and is perceived from corruption and coagulation: it
is the household divinity which, discharging its function, nourishes, cherishes, quickens the whole
body, and is indeed the foundation of life, the source of all action.
- William Harvey

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the cardiovascular system is primarily to supply oxygen and remove carbon
dioxide from metabolizing tissues.1 Perhaps this is the reason for the almost immediate cardiac
response to the beginning of exercise when the metabolic needs of the muscles increase
dramatically. Indeed, cardiovascular responses are so rapid that the severity of exercise stress
is usually judged on the basis of an instantaneous heart rate sample.
A second important cardiovascular function during exercise is removal of excess heat
(see Chapter 5). Vasodilation of surface blood vessels brings warm blood in closer contact
with the cool air to facilitate heat transfer. This response does not occur at all rapidly,
however. Due to the thermal mass of the body, 10-15 minutes may elapse between the start of
exercise and active vasodilatory responses.
There are times when the chemical transport and heat transport functions of the blood
come into direct conflict, since blood required for supply of skeletal muscle needs may be
shunted to the skin for heat removal. When this happens, muscle metabolism must become at
least partially anaerobic. Since there is a limit to the amount of anaerobic metabolism that can
occur, this conflict can directly lead to a shortened exercise period.
It is the purpose of this chapter to detail cardiovascular mechanics and control during
exercise. This book considers four elements of the cardiovascular system: the heart, the
vasculature, respiratory interface, and thermal interface. Respiratory interface is treated in
Chapter 4 and thermal interface in Chapter 5.

CARDIOVASCULAR MECHANICS

The cardiovascular mechanical system is composed of blood, vessels which contain the blood,
and the heart to pump the blood through the vessels. In addition, the system contains
substances to repair rupture.

Because the blood permeates the entire body, it also performs a useful humoral communication function. is important in
assisting transport and removal of chemical metabolites, and is useful in the body's defense against disease.

Blood Characteristics

Blood composition is very complex, and much beyond the scope of this book. There are,
however, physical properties of the blood which are of concern to bioengineers and exercise
physiologists.
Composition. A general classification separates blood into red blood cells, white blood
cells, and plasma. Blood cells constitute 45% of total blood volume and plasma 55% (Ganong,
1963). Circulating blood2 contains an average of 5.4 x 1015 red blood cells per cubic meter in
men and 4.8 x 1015 per cubic meter in women (Ganong, 1963).
+
Oxygen-Carrying Capacity. Oxygen is transported by the blood by two different, but
complementary mechanisms: as oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma and as oxygen
chemically united with hemoglobin in the red blood cells (Table 3.2.1). Each human red blood
cell contains approximately 29 pg (picograms) of hemoglobin. The body of a 70 kg man
contains about 900 g of hemoglobin and that of a 60kg woman, about 660g (Ganong, 1963).
Each hemoglobin molecule contains four heme units, each of which can bind with one oxygen
molecule (i.e., diatomic oxygen, O2). When fully saturated, each kilogram of hemoglobin
contains 1.34 x 10-3 m3, (1.34mL O2/g) (Ganong, 1963). Since average men have about 160
kilograms hemoglobin per cubic meter of blood (160g/L blood), 0.214 m3 O2/m3 blood
(214mL O2/L blood) is bound by their hemoglobin.
The amount of oxygen which is physically and passively dissolved in the blood plasma is
usually expressed in terms of partial pressure. The partial pressure of a gas is defined as that
pressure which would exist in the gas for the free gas to be in equilibrium with the gas in
solution. The higher the partial pressure exerted by a gas above a solution, the more gas will
dissolve in solution. For respiratory oxygen, the number of cubic meters of gas dissolved in
one cubic meter of blood at 38ºC at a partial pressure of one atmosphere (1 atm, 105 N/m2) and
with gas volume corrected to conditions of standard temperature and pressure
,3 called the Bunsen coefficient, is 0.023 (Mende, 1976).
For example, if the percentage of oxygen in the alveolus is 12%, expressed as dry
gas, then the percentage of oxygen, taking into account that alveolar air is saturated with water
vapor, is

The partial pressure of oxygen4 therefore is
pO2 = (11.2/100)(105 N/m2) = 11.2 x 103 N/m2

(3.2.1)

and the amount of oxygen dissolved5 in the pulmonary venous blood is

(2.58mL O2 /L blood)

(3.2.2)

The ratio of circulating blood volume, expressed as cubic centimeters, to body mass, expressed in kilograms, is about 80.
Standard temperature and pressure are OºC and 1 atm (760 mm Hg, or 105 N/m2). Furthermore,. respiratory gases are usually
expressed as dry gas and 6266 N/m2 (47 mm Hg) is subtracted from total atmospheric pressure to account for water vapor in
lung gases.
4
Normal arterial pCO2 is 5.3 kN/m2 (40 mm Hg) and normal arterial pO2 is 13.3 kN/m2 (100 mm Hg).
5
The amount of O2 in mL per 100 mL of blood in a particular sample is usually designated by physiologists as the O2 content of
the blood. For purposes of unit consistency, we use (m3 O2/m3 blood). To convert (m3 O2/m3 blood) to (mL O2/100 mL blood),
multiply (m3 O2/m3 blood) by 100.

In addition, hemoglobin saturation at an oxygen partial pressure of 11.2 x 103 N/m3 is about
95.5%. Therefore, hemoglobin transports another 0.203 m3 O2 blood. This example illustrates
the extreme advantage of the presence of hemoglobin in the blood—about 100 times as much
oxygen is transported as it would depending on physical solution alone. Other gases, such as
nitrogen, which are not bound by carrier substances are dependent on only physical solution
for movement by blood.
It is not completely known whether hemodynamic, vascular, or metabolic factors limit
maximum oxygen uptake. Saltin (1985) presented evidence that the ability of the skeletal
muscles to utilize oxygen (see Section 1.3) is much greater than the ability of the heart and
blood to supply oxygen. At high muscle blood perfusion rates the low rate of oxygen

extraction related to the low mean transit time of blood passing through the capillaries.
Enlargement of muscular capillary beds which accompanies endurance training probably
serves the purpose of lengthening the mean transit time, not necessarily to increase blood
flow.6 The presence of hemoglobin in the blood thus tends to narrow the gap between oxygen
supply capacity and oxygen utilization capacity.
Oxygen bound to hemoglobin is in equilibrium with oxygen in plasma solution. When
oxygen is removed from hemoglobin, it first passes into the plasma as dissolved oxygen
before it is made available to the tissues. When oxygen is added to hemoglobin, it comes from
alveolar tissue by way of solution in the plasma.
It is natural, therefore, that the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin be expressed in
terms of oxygen partial pressure of the surrounding plasma. Typical oxygen dissociation
curves with their characteristic sigmoid shapes are seen in Figures 3.2.1 through 3.2.3.
Blood is very well buffered to minimize sudden changes in its chemical and physical
structure. The hemoglobin saturation curve does shift, however, in response to changes of
pCO2 (Figure 3.2.1),7 pH (Figure 3.2.2),8 and temperature (Figure 3.2.3). All of these are
important in compensation for the oxygen demands of exercising muscle.
Figure 3.2.1 shows the direct effect of carbon dioxide on hemoglobin dissociation. For
any given level of oxygen partial pressure, an increase in plasma carbon dioxide reduces the
equilibrium hemoglobin saturation. Oxygen is thus removed from each hemoglobin molecule
and either increases dissolved oxygen or moves to the respiring tissues. Since carbon dioxide
is produced most in regions with high oxygen demand, this hemoglobin saturation shift makes
extra oxygen available where it is most needed. In the muscles, this extra oxygen is stored by
myoglobin (see Section 1.3.2), a molecule with function similar to hemoglobin, for use as
needed by muscle cells.
When excess carbon dioxide is added to the venous blood, an important blood
bicarbonate ( HCO 3− ) buffering system minimizes changes to the blood and allows higher
carbon dioxide-carrying capacity. This buffering occurs by means of the following reversible
chemical reactions (Ganong, 1963):
H 2 O + CO 2 ⇔ H 2 CO 3 ⇔ H + + HCO 3−

(3.2.3)

As carbon dioxide is added to the blood, it combines with plasma water to form a weak acid,
carbonic acid. This dissociates into hydrogen ions and blood bicarbonate. At the lungs these
reactions are reversed and blood bicarbonate is reduced as carbon dioxide is expelled.
Carbon dioxide production also changes acidity of the blood, as measured by pH9, which
also affects the hemoglobin saturation curve (Figure 3.2.2). The Henderson-Hasselbalch
6
However, Saltin also adds that the capacity of the muscles to receive blood flow exceeds by a factor of 2 to 3 the capacity of
the heart to supply the flow. Because of this, arterioles feeding the muscles must normally be subject to a vasoconstrictive
neural control.
7
Reduced hemoglobin is a weak acid. When combined with oxygen, hemoglobin (Hb) undergoes the chemical process which

−

O 2 + HHb ⇔ HHbO2 ⇔ HbO2 + H +
makes additional hydrogen ions available to drive the carbon dioxide dissociation equilibrium (Equation 3.2.3) to the left. Thus
increased oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin is accompanied by increased availability of carbon dioxide. This process is
called the Haldane effect (Tazawa et al., 1983).
8
Hemoglobin has a high buffering capacity over the normal range of blood pH. Without this buffering capacity. blood pH would
vary greatly as blood carbon dioxide content changed. As CO2 is added to the blood, pH falls. With a fall in blood pH, oxygen is
released from the hemoglobin molecule. This interaction between blood pH and oxygen saturation is called the Bohr effect.
9
pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. As the blood becomes more acid, hydrogen ion
concentration increases and pH decreases.


75

Figure 3.2.1 Effect of blood carbon dioxide on the oxygen dissociation curve of whole blood. CO2 partial
pressure for each curve is given in N/m2 (mm Hg). An increase in CO2 causes blood of a given oxygen
saturation to increase the pO2, thus making O2 more readily available to dissolve in the plasma and
transfer to surrounding tissues. Normal pCO2 is taken to be 5330 N/m2 (40mm Hg). (Adapted and used

Normal c HCO- / c H 2 CO3 ratio is 20 and normal arterial blood pH level is 7.4 (Ganong, 1963).

As long as blood oxygen levels can supply all the necessary oxygen required by
exercising muscles, there is a direct correspondence between blood pH and CO2 produced by
metabolism. When metabolism becomes nonaerobic. and lactic acid is a product of
incomplete metabolism (see Section 1.3.2), an increase in hydrogen ion concentration occurs,
blood pH lowers, and blood pCO2 rises. The equilibrium oxygen hemoglobin saturation curve
indicates that further oxygen is then made available to the muscles.
Aberman et al. (1973) presented an equation for the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation
curve which is mathematically derived and can be useful for calculation purposes:

Figure 3.2.2 Effect of blood acidity level on the oxygen dissociation curve of whole blood. Blood pH is
given for each curve. As blood becomes more acid, its pH falls and blood pO2 rises for any given level of
hemoglobin saturation. Thus O2 is made more readily available to dissolve in the plasma and be
transferred to surrounding tissues. Normal blood pH is usually taken to be 7.40. (Adapted and used with
permission from Peters and Van Slyke, 1931.)

Equation 3.2.5 fits only the standard oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve with a pO2 at
50% saturation of 3.546 kN/m2 (26.6 mm Hg). It is not accurate below a pO2, of 253 N/m2
(1.9 mm Hg) or above a pO2, of 93.3 kN/ m2 (700 mm Hg) and should not be used to predict
saturation when pulmonary shunts, cardiac output, or arterial-venous oxygen content
differences are calculated (Aberman et al., t973).
Hemoglobin in the red blood cells is also involved in transport of carbon dioxide
(Kagawa, 1984; Mochizuki et al., 1985). Carbon dioxide reacts with amino groups, principally
hemoglobin, to form carbamino compounds. Reduced hemoglobin (that which has released its
oxygen and taken up more hydrogen ions) forms carbamino compounds much more readily
than oxyhemoglobin (Ganong, 1963). Thus transport of carbon dioxide is facilitated in venous
blood (Figure 3.2.4).

reduced blood. Blood goes through a cycle, as indicated by A (arterial blood) and V (venous blood) in the

Base excess refers to the bicarbonate concentration in Equation 3.2.3 and varies directly as pCO2.

From Table 3.2.1, we can see that male arterial blood carries a total of 0.490 m3 CO2/m3
blood. Of these, 0.026 m3 CO2/m3 blood is in free solution and 0.464 m3 CO2/m3 blood is
combined in some way. Of the combined CO2, .022 m3 CO2/m3 blood is transported as carbamino
compounds and 0.442 m3 CO2/m3 blood is transported as bicarbonate.
Viscosity. Aside from the physicochemical characteristics of blood already described, blood
must also be considered in light of its flow characteristics through the blood vessels. Since
blood is a homogeneous substance from only the coarsest perspective, it cannot be expected to
behave quite like truly homogeneous fluids such as water and oil.
The most important flow characteristic of blood is its viscosity, which is a measure of its
resistance to motion. If two plates containing a thickness r of fluid between them are drawn
apart by a force F at rate v (Figure 3.2.5), then the force F divided by the plate area A is defined
as the shear stress τ = F/A, and the rate of shear is defined as γ = dv/dr. Shear stress is related

Figure 3.2.5 Conceptual apparatus for determining fluid rheological properties.

Figure 3.2.6 Fluid rheological characteristics.


79

to the force required to pump a fluid through a tube, and the rate of shear is related to the rate
at which the fluid flows.
The ratio of shear stress to rate of shear is given the name viscosity:
µ=

τ F /A
=
γ dv / dr

(3.2.7)

where µ = viscosity, kg/(m·sec)
τ = shear stress, N/m2
γ = rate of shear, sec–1
v = speed of plate separation, m/sec
r = distance between plates, m
For many fluids the viscosity is constant, and these are called Newtonian fluids. Blood plasma
is a Newtonian fluid with a viscosity of 1.1 - 1.6 g/(m·sec) (Attinger and Michie, 1976). Fluids
with nonconstant viscosities are termed non-Newtonian. Whole blood is among these.
Figure 3.2.6 is general plot of shear stress against rate of shear for various fluids
(Johnson, 1980). Pseudoplastic materials generally have decreasing viscosity with increasing
shear rate. These fluids are comparatively hard to start moving but easier to move once flow
has been established. Dilatent fluids generally have increasing viscosity with increasing rate
of shear. These fluids require more energy to keep them moving than to start them moving.11
Bingham plastics are nearly Newtonian but require a yield stress to be overcome before they
will move. Whole blood is generally considered to behave as a Bingham plastic, but
mathematical properties of Bingham plastic models are inferior to those for pseudoplastics,
and sometimes blood is approximated as a pseudoplastic material.
The simplest model to describe characteristics seen in Figure 3.2.6 is the power law
model (Skelland, 1967):
τ = Kγn + C

(3.2.8)

where K = consistency coefficient, N·secn/m2
n = flow behavior index, dimensionless
C = yield stress, N/m2
In the case of a Newtonian fluid, n = 1, C = 0, and K = µ = viscosity. If the yield stress is
ignored, then mathematical manipulation of Equation 3.2.8 becomes much easier, and thus
many Bingham fluids are approximated as pseudoplastics. It has been found that
measurements obtained on blood do not give constant values of n and K for more than two
decades of shear rates, and thus Equation 3.2.8 has limited usefulness (Charm and Kurland,
1974).
Fluids in which particles or large molecules are dispersed are called suspensions, and
suspensions often obey the Casson equation (Charm and Kurland, 1974):

τ =K γ + C

(3.2.9)

Whole blood appears to be in this category (Attinger and Michie, 1976~ Oka, 1981).12
11

Conceptually, pseudoplastics may be thought of as long-chain molecules suspended in a fluid bed. Upon standing they tangle
and intertwine. Once moved, however, they begin to untangle and to line up parallel each other. Eventually they slide past each
other with relative ease. Dilatent fluids can be thought of as densely packed hard spheres with just enough fluid between them
to fill the voids. As they begin to move, there is sufficient fluid to lubricate between them. As they move faster, their dense
packing becomes disrupted, and there is insufficient fluid to completely lubricate their motion. Thus they become harder to
move faster. Fruit purees are pseudoplastics; quicksand is a dilatent.
12
There are other types of non-Newtonian behavior as well. Suspensions of long-chain elastic molecules, in which the molecules
add a significant elastic effect to flow of the fluid, are termed viscoelastic. Analysis of viscoelastic fluids is much beyond the
scope of this book, and blood flow modeling has not usually included elasticity of particles in the blood.
Fluid time-dependent phenomena are also present. Thixotropic substances decrease viscosity with time and rheopectic
substances increase viscosity as time goes on. Thixotropic behavior is closely associated with stress relaxation and creep
(Attinger and Michie, 1976).


80

Figure 3.2.7 Viscosity-shear rate relationships of reconstituted blood from 37 to 22ºC. Hematocrits of the
curves in each plot are 80% (top), 60%, 40%, 20%, and 0% (bottom). The axis labeled viscosity is
actually the slope of the shear stress-rate of shear diagram (Figure 3.2.6). Since viscosity appears to be
higher at low rates of shear, these measurements confirm whole blood to be a pseudoplastic substance
tending to Newtonian as hematocrit decreases. (Adapted and used with permission from Rand et al.,
1964.)

At shear rates greater than 100 sec–1 normal blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid (Attinger
and Michie, 1976; Haynes and Burton, 1959; Pedley et al., 1980) with a viscosity of 4–
5 g/(m·sec) (Attinger and Michie, 1976). This value decreases by 2-3% per degree Celsius rise
in temperature (Attinger and Michie. 1976). As hematocrit13 increases, apparent viscosity
increases nonlinearly (Figure 3.2.7). Because red blood cells deform so easily, blood exhibits
about half the viscosity of a suspension of similarly sized and distributed hard spheres in
plasma (Attinger and Michie, 1976).
Exercising individuals exhibit a so-called plasma shift due to body fluid losses mostly as
sweat. Plasma volume decreases during exercise, thus concentrating suspended materials. This
hemoconcentration averages less than 2% below exercise levels requiring 40% of maximum
oxygen uptake (see Section 1.3); above 40% of maximum oxygen uptake hemoconcentration is
13

Hematocrit is defined as the ratio of red blood cell volume to total blood volume, in percent. Hematocrit is usually determined
by centrifugal separation. Hematocrit may vary from one vascular bed to another, where microvessels generally have lower
hematocrit than their supply vessels. Fluid near the wall of blood vessels usually contains fewer red blood cells than the fluid in
the center (Attinger and Michie, 1976). Hematocrit for men is usually about 0.47 and for women and children is 0.42 (Astrand
and Rodahl, 1970).


81

directly proportional to work rate (Senay, 1979). Transient plasma volume decreases of 6–
12% with the onset of exercise are corrected within 10–20 min after exercise ceases.
Acclimation (see Section 5.3.5) to work in the heat is accompanied by a chronic hematocrit
decrease as plasma volume increases.
3.2.2

Vascular Characteristics

Blood vessels serve the purposes of blood transport, filtering of pressure extremes, regulation
of blood pressure, chemical exchange, and blood storage. They generally are classified as
arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins, each with different storage, elastic, and resistance
properties (Table 3.2.2).
Organization. The arteries are the first vessels encountered by the blood as it leaves the heart.
Arteries are large-diameter vessels with very elastic walls. The large interior diameter allows a
high volume of stored blood and the elastic walls store energy during heart contraction
(systole) and release it between contractions (diastole). Thus the arteries play an important
role in converting an intermittent blood delivery into a continuous one.
Arterioles are smaller vessels with less elastic walls containing transversely oriented

smooth muscle fibers. Whenever these muscle fibers contract, arteriole resistance increases and
blood flow decreases. Arterioles thus play an important regulating role in maintaining total blood
pressure and in distributing blood flow to various organs (Tables 3.2.3 and 3.2.4).

Capillaries are very small (5–20 x 10–6 m diameter) vessels with very thin walls. It is
through these thin walls that gas and metabolite exchange occurs.14 Precapillary sphincter
muscles control blood flow through individual capillary beds.
Venous blood return begins at the collecting venules and ends at the vena cava. As the
veins become larger, greater amounts of muscle tissue are found in their walls. Larger veins
also contain one-way valves, which prohibit blood from returning to smaller veins and
capillaries. Muscular activity squeezes veins and moves blood toward the heart, and this blood
cannot return to its former position because of the valves. Venous systems normally contain
65–70% of the total peripheral blood volume and thus act mainly as storage vessels (often
termed windkessel vessels because of their considerable wall compliance) (Astrand and
Rodahl, 1970).
In addition to this singular blood flow pathway are shunts, called anastomoses, between
arteries or arterioles and veins. They function as return paths when the capillary structure of a
particular region has been closed off during trauma or exercise.

Resistance. Basic to understanding of cardiovascular mechanics is the concept of resistance to
flow in a tube. Traditionally, resistance, which is the ratio of pressure loss to flow rate, has been
considered for rigid tubes of uniform cross section containing fully developed laminar flow. None
of these conditions is likely to exist in actual blood vessels.

Below Reynolds number15 of 1000-2000, laminar flow conditions will usually exist.
Disturbances such as bifurcations, corners, and changes in cross-sectional shape or area tend
to disturb laminar flow. In laminar flow, pressure loss is directly proportional to flow velocity,

14
Hydrostatic and osmotic pressure in the arteriole end of the capillaries is higher than mean interstitial pressure of surrounding
tissue, and water is forced from the plasma to the extravascular fluid. On the venous end, the pressure gradient is reversed and
water rejoins the plasma from the interstitial fluid. Reduced arterial pressure results in increased absorption of fluid into the
blood to partially compensate for reduced pressure. Osmotic pressure of human serum was measured by Starling as 3333 N/m2,
or 25 mrn Hg (Catchpole, 1966), and osmotic pressure in the interstitial space has been estimated as 667 N/m2, or 5 mm Hg
(Catchpole, 1966), thus leaving an osmotic balance of 2666 N/m2 in favor of reabsorption of water into the blood vessel. Heart
failure causes venous pressure to rise and edema results.

but for nonlaminar or nondeveloped laminar flow, pressure loss is more closely related to the
velocity squared.16

This equation illustrates the extreme importance exerted by vessel radius on blood flow
resistance. A decrease of only 19% in radius will halve the flow, illustrating the extremely
sensitive control that can be exerted by the arterioles (Burton, 1965). This equation is
indicative only, because the flow is actually pulsatile and unsteady, bends and junctions in the
vessel walls do not allow sufficient distance for development of the parabolic velocity profile
indicated by Equation 3.2.10 to fully develop, the vessel walls distend during systole and
contract during diastole, the system is nonlinear, and blood does not possess a constant

and the cross-sectional shape of the tube. As flow behavior index decreases, the transition to turbulent flow from laminar flow
occurs at higher Reynolds numbers, up to Re = 4000 – 5000 for n = 0.3.

Resistance is usually defined as force per unit flow. Units of resistance would be N·sec/m3. Here we are using a definition of
resistance of pressure per unit flow, and thus the units are N·sec/m5.

viscosity. Further analysis of the vascular system has been focused principally on the large
vessels, with mean Reynolds number of 1250, peak Reynolds number of 6250, and mean
blood shear rates high enough to treat blood as a Newtonian fluid (Pedley et al., 1980). Since
the shear rate (dv/dr) is highest near the wall, most viscous pressure drop also occurs near the
wall. Despite all this, Reynolds numbers greater than 2000 usually signify turbulent flow.
Very Small Vessels. Small vessels, such as the capillaries, are of the same diameter as red
blood cells, and these cells cannot usually pass through the capillaries without some
deformation. Reynolds numbers of the capillaries are about 1.0, meaning that flow is so low
that Navier-Stokes equations19 are usually applied to capillary flow. Blood flowing through
capillaries cannot be considered a continuous fluid but must be treated as composed of
individual cellular bodies in a surrounding fluid medium (Pittman and Ellsworth, 1986).
Apparent viscosity of blood decreases (the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect) in tubes with
diameter below about 400 µm (Pedley et al., 1980). This can be attributed to two explanations
to be investigated further. First, there is a tendency of cellular components in the blood,
notably red blood cells, to vacate the area next to the vessel wall. This is largely due to a static
pressure difference, which is predicted by Bernoulli's equation for total energy in a moving
fluid (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970; Baumeister, 1967):

p2 – p1 = ½ (v12 – v22) + (z1 – z2)ρg

(3.2.13)

where pi = static pressure measured at a point i, N/m2
vi = fluid velocity measures at point i, m/sec
zi = height of point i above a reference plane, m
ρ = density, kg/m3
g = acceleration due to gravity, m/sec2
This equation states that the pressure on the side of a red blood cell will be less in the center of the
vessel where the velocity is greatest than toward the side of the vessel where velocity is lower
(assuming no significant difference in height). Thus cells will be pushed toward the center of the
tube. However, because different local velocities cause differences in frictional drag on different
sides of the red blood cell, cellular motion is a complicated maneuver. Segré and Silberberg (1962)
showed that red blood cells tend to accumulate at six-tenths of the radius from the center of the
vessel.

Most frictional loss in a vessel occurs near the wall where the change in velocity with
radius is greatest. The "axial streaming" tendency of red blood cells removes particles from
the area near the wall and replaces them with relatively low-viscosity plasma (Bauer et al.,
1983). Thus friction is greatly reduced. Without this effect, the heart would be unable to
maintain adequate bodily circulation.
The Navier-Stokes equations (Middleman, 1972; Talbot and Gessner, 1973) relate

Fundamental equations for a liquid are based on the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. Momentum equations are
identified as the Navier-Stokes equations. For a cartesian, three-dimensional steady flow of a viscous liquid, the momentum

It is possible to use this equation with the Fahreus-Lindqvist data to estimate the thickness of
the plasma layer δ. Such estimates fall in the range of 1 x 10–6 m (Middleman, 1972). Using
this value and a viscosity ratio (µP/µb) of 0.25, the apparent viscosity changes seen for very
small tubes can be closely predicted.
A second explanation of the low resistance in small tubes is called the sigma effect of Dix
and Scott-Blair (Attinger and Michie, 1976; Burton, 1965; Haynes, 1960).20 According to this
concept, red blood cell diameters are not insignificant compared to vessel diameter, and thus
the fluid cannot be treated as a homogeneous medium (Lightfoot, 1974). This means that
integration of velocity cannot be performed as in Equation 3.2.11. Rather, a summation of
finite layers is more appropriate. These finite layers are cylindrical in shape with thickness
equal to red blood cell diameter.
The sigma effect can be quantified by imagining the tube made of concentric hollow
cylinders of thickness ∆r (Dix and Scott-Blair, 1940) with the central core as a solid cylinder
of either diameter 2∆r or 0 (Figure 3.2.8). Total volume flow rate is just

20

The sigma effect is erroneously named for the standard Greek letter denoting summation. Actually, Dix and Scott-Blair used a
lowercase sigma to signify the rate of change of shear stress with rate of change of shear rate at a point (Dix and Scott-Blair,
1940). The two sigmas subsequently have been confused by other authors.

Apparent agreement between the Fahraeus-Lindqvist data and sigma effect calculations can be
seen in Figure 3.2.9.
Lightfoot (1974) also mentions other reasons for the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. He states
that because red cells are concentrated in the central, faster moving portions of the tube, their
residence time is less and their mean concentration lower than in either the feed or outflowing
blood. He also indicates that red cells are partially blocked from entering small tubes, thus
reducing the hematocrit of the blood in small tubes. Good agreement between experimental
data and prediction based on hematocrit adjustment has been found. The Fahraeus-Lindqvist
effect is thus a curious example of at least three explanations which, by themselves, can each
match experimental data. There is little evidence to testify to the relative importance of each
of these.

Figure 3.2.10 The heart and circulation. Blood from the left ventricle is discharged through the aorta to
systemic capillary beds. Blood from the head, neck, upper extremities and thorax returns to the right
atrium through the superior vena cava. Blood from the lower extremities, pelvis, and abdomen returns via
the inferior vena cava. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery and
blood returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary vein. (Adapted and used with permission from
Astrand and Rodahl, 1970.)

Much more work has been done to analyze blood vessels, pulsatile flow in vessels, and
systems of vessels acting together. For more information on these analyses, refer to Talbot and
Gessner (1973) and Pedley et at. (1980).
3.2.3

Heart Characteristics

Central to the cardiovascular system is the motivating object, the heart. The heart is not just
one pump; it is four pumps. There is one pair of pumps which service the pulmonary
vascularity, and this pair is located on the right side of the heart organ. On the left side is the
pair of pumps which push blood through the systemic circulation. Each of these pairs consists
of a pressure pump, which develops sufficient pressure to overcome vascular resistance, called
the ventricle. The atrium in each pair serves to fill its ventricle in a timely and efficient
manner. Figure 3.2.10 illustrates the heart and circulation.
Each of these pumps is intermittent, being very similar to a piston pump.23 Each
contraction of the heart muscle (myocardium) is called a systole; the relaxation of
myocardium is called diastole. During diastole the atria fill with venous return blood. Over
two-thirds of ventricular filling at rest occurs passively during diastole. During the initial
stages of systole, the atria force blood into their respective ventricles, which subsequently
23
A piston pump is a positive displacement pump which delivers the same volume during each stroke. The volume delivered by
the heart varies because the walls of the pump chamber are distensible.


90

pump blood into the arteries during the latter stages of systole. Blood is therefore delivered to the
arteries in a pulsatile manner (Meier et al., 1980). Flaps of membrane acting as valves prohibit
backflow of blood from the ventricles to atria and from the arteries to ventricles.

Starling's Law. With four pumps in a series arrangement, there must be a mechanism that
allows each pump to vary the volume of blood it pumps during each contraction (called the
stroke volume, or SV). Otherwise, blood outflow would be limited by the smallest stroke
volume and, during periods of change, blood would pool behind the weakest pump.
Fortunately, the walls of each pump are distensible and follow a length-tension relationship
characteristic of other muscle tissue (see Section 5.2). That is, cardiac muscle increases its
strength of contraction as it is stretched (see Figure 3.2.11), thus enabling each pump to adjust
its output according to the amount of blood available to fill it. Starling's law of the heart states
that the "energy of contraction is proportional to the initial length of the cardiac muscle fiber"
(Ganong, 1963).
Shearing stress existing in the walls of a cylindrical pressure vessel is given by (Attinger,
1976a)

Figure 3.2.11 Length-tension relationship for dog cardiac muscle. As blood fills the ventricle during
diastole, muscle fibers stretch and increase intraventricular pressure. During the subsequent systole,
pressure produced in the ventricle will rise higher for cardiac muscle that has been stretched more
(increased diastolic filling). With higher intraventricular pressure, more blood will be pumped in the time
available. Thus the ventricle is able to adjust its output to its input. (Adapted and used with permission

where r = average wall radius, m
∆r = wall thickness, m

This is the so-called law of Laplace24 relating shear stress in the wall to wall radius.
Frequently it is applied to the heart and blood vessels where wall thickness is not negligible
compared to average wall radius. The law of Laplace, however, does show the inverse
relationship between wall tension (shear stress) and radius. It is frequently seen that
cardiovascular hypertension (pressures above normal) is accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy
(enlarged size) in order that the myocardium can produce the pressures required to force blood
through the vasculature. The enlarged heart, caused by wall thickening, reduces the average
shear stress in the wall.
Similarly, the accommodation of the heart to larger amounts of incoming blood, as
represented by Starling's law, relates to the law of Laplace. A larger amount of blood in a
ventricle stretches the wall more than normal and increases the wall tension. This preloads the
myocardium and enables it to develop more force to more forcefully pump the blood out (see
the length-tension relationship, Figure 3.2.11).25
Being in a closed loop, blood returning to the heart is actually pushed back to the atria by
pressure developed by the ventricles. Rather than requiring a large pressure to accomplish
this, a relatively small pressure is required only to overcome vascular resistance. With no
changes in posture, the system acts like a syphon (Burton, 1965), without appreciable
elevation difference between the inlet to the tube (aorta) and outlet from the tube (vena cava).
The effect of uphill venous return is thus none at all.
With a sudden change in posture, distensibility of the veins causes pooling of blood to
occur in the lowermost part of the body and venous return is momentarily reduced. During
exercise, where posture changes are constantly occurring, skeletal muscle pressure on the
veins pumps blood back to the heart. This is fortunate, because the heart and collapsible blood
vessels could not operate effectively by attempting to create a vacuum to induce blood return.
The heart is, however, an efficient organ for pressure production.
Blood Pressure. Normal resting systemic blood pressure26 is 16.0 kN/m2 (120 mm Hg)
during systole and 11.0 kN/m2 (80 mm Hg) during diastole in males. These values increase
with age, as seen in Table 3.2.5. After the sharp rise in systolic pressure that accompanies
puberty, there is a gradual increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures, probably due to a
gradual decrease with age of the elasticity of arterial walls (Morehouse and Miller, 1967). In
24

The law of Laplace for an arbitrary smooth three-dimensional shape is
τ = p/∆r(1/r1 + 1/r2)

where r1 and r2 are orthogonal radii of curvature. For a cylinder, r2 = ∞ and τ = pr1/∆r. For a sphere, r1 = r2 and τ = pr1/2∆r.
25
The law of Laplace has also been applied to blood vessels to show that capillaries, for instance, can withstand high internal
blood pressures (see Table 3.2.6) because they are so small in diameter (see Table 3.2.2).
26
Physiological pressures are normally measured in mm Hg. To obtain N/m2 from mm Hg multiply mm Hg by 133.32.

Pressures in the vena cava will fluctuate in a very pronounced manner with respiratory

girls the sharp rise at puberty is less marked and is often followed by a decrease until the age
of 18, after which pressure increases, as it does with males, but it is usually l.3 kN/m2
(l0 mm Hg) higher in females (Figure 3.2.12).
Diastolic pressures given in Table 3.2.5 are pressures measured outside the heart's left
ventricle.27 Left ventricular diastolic pressures decrease to nearly zero (Scher, 1966a). Table
3.2.6 gives resting blood pressure values at many points in the cardiovascular system.
Other influences on blood pressure are emotional state (increases blood pressure),
exercise [increases blood pressure from a typical systolic/diastolic value of 16/10.7 kN/m2
(120/80 mm Hg) at rest to 23.3/14.7 kN/m2 (175/110 mm Hg) during exercise], and body
position (decreases in blood pressure accompany raising). Arm exercise causes larger blood
pressure increases than leg exercise (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Blood pressure is generally
independent of body size for nonobese individuals (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).
Heart Rate. Heart rate is an expression of the number of times the heart contracts in a
specified unit of time. For each beat of the heart one stroke volume is pumped through the
vasculature. Heart rate at rest is normally taken as 1.17 beats/sec (70 beats/min), although the
normal range is 0.83-1.67 beats/sec (50-100 beats/min) (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).28 There
is a tendency for active athletes to have lower resting heart rates due to increased vagal tone,
although there is not a clear correlation between resting heart rate and general physical
condition in the general public. Resting heart rate usually is 0.08-0.17 beats/sec (5-10
beats/min) higher in women than in men (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
27
The airtight rubber cuff (sphygmomanometer) used to measure blood pressure applies sufficient pressure to the main artery of
the arm to collapse the artery and stop blood flow. Sounds produced by turbulence as blood seeps through the occlusion during
systole indicate that cuff pressure is just lower than systolic pressure. When all sounds disappear while cuff pressure is being
released, no more turbulence is indicated, meaning that the artery is no longer partially occluded by the cuff. This cuff pressure
is taken as diastolic pressure. Direct blood pressure measurements obtained from a needle inserted into the artery indicate that
indirect blood pressure measurements are accurate during rest but not during exercise. For strenuous exercise, systolic pressure
may be understimated by 1100-2000 N/m2 and overestimated during the first few minutes of recovery by 2100-5100 N/m2.
Errors are even greater in the measurement of diastolic pressure (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
28
Elevated heart rates are normally referred to as tachycardia. Bradycardia is a heart rate lower than normal.


94

Heart rate increases during exercise, with heart rate accelerating immediately after, or
perhaps even before, the onset of exercise. The rapidity with which heart rate returns to
normal at the cessation of exercise is often used as a test of cardiovascular fitness.
In many types of work, the increase in heart rate is linear with increase in workload
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970) as related to maximal oxygen uptake (see Section 1.3).
Exceptions to this relationship appear at very high work rates (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970)
near the anaerobic threshold (contrasted with the aerobic threshold; see Section 1.3.5 and
Ribeiro et al., 1985).
For instance, Astrand and Rodahl (1970) present data on maximum oxygen uptake for
nearly 1500 males:

VDO 2 max = ( 4.2 − 0.03 y ) / 60,000

(3.2.39)

VDO 2 max = ( 2.6 − 0.01y) / 60,000

(3.2.40)

for 1700 females:

and for 3 exceptional male long distance runners:

VDO 2 max = (7.1 − 0.07 y) / 60,000

(3.2.41)

where VDO 2max = maximum oxygen uptake, m3/sec
y = age, yr
In each of these cases, maximum oxygen uptake corresponds to a maximum heart rate29 for
men or women given by
HRmax = (220 – y)/60

(3.2.42)

where HRmax = maximum heart rate, beats/sec
Since basal oxygen consumption is only about 5 x 10-7 m3/sec (see Table 5.2.19), it is
usually neglected. Therefore,

VDO 2
VD

=

O 2 max

HR − HRr
HR max − HRr

(3.2.43)

where VDO 2 = predicted oxygen uptake at heart rate HR, m3/sec
HR = submaximal heart rate, beats/sec
HRr = resting heart rate, beats/sec (HRr = 1.17 for males and 1.33 for females)
Cardiac Output. Cardiac output (CO) is the amount of blood pumped per unit time. It is the
product of stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR):

CO = (SV) (HR)

(3.2.44)

Cardiac output is approximately 92-100 x 10-6 m3/sec (92- 100 mL/sec) at rest with an average
stroke volume of 80 x 10-6 (80 mL) at a heart rate of 1.17 beats/sec (70 beats/min). Resting
29
Lesage et al. (1985) conducted an experiment to determine familial relationships for maximum heart rate, maximum blood
lactate, and maximum oxygen uptake during exercise. A relationship for maximum heart rate was suggested between children
and mothers but not for children and fathers. A similar relationship was found for VO 2 max / kg.


95

and Rodahl, 1970.)

cardiac output depends on posture: 83–100 x 10-6 m3/sec recumbent, 67–83 x 10-6 m3/sec
sitting, and less for standing (Morehouse and Miller, 1967).
A dimensional analysis of cardiac output and its components, stroke volume and heart
rate, is instructive in the comparison of similarly built animals of different dimensions.
Astrand and Rodahl (1970), in their consideration of dimensional dependence, show that heart
rate is inversely proportional to body length:
∆

HR ≡ 1 / L

(3.2.45)

where L = length dimension
and ∆
≡ denotes dimensional dependence. Thus a taller (and heavier) person would be expected
to have a lower resting heart rate.30
Heart weight is directly proportional to body weight (Figure 3.2.13), and stroke volume is
directly proportional to heart weight (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Thus
3
SV ∆
≡ L

(3.2.46)

Table 3.2.7 shows the increased heart volumes of trained athletes. Larger hearts are expected
to have larger stroke volumes and therefore lower heart rates for any required cardiac output.
This is exactly the effect seen: well-trained athletes do, indeed, have lower heart rates.
Cardiac output, being the product of stroke volume and heart rate, must therefore be
proportional to body dimension squared:
2
CO ∆

(3.2.47)

Thc resting heart rate of a 25 g mouse is about 11.7, that of a 70 kg man is 1.17, and for a 3000 kg elephant, it is 0.42 beats/sec
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).

Astrand and Rodahl (1970) indicate that, if cardiac output were proportional to body
mass ( ∆
≡ L3), and not L2, the blood velocity in the aorta (cross-sectional area proportional to L2)
would have to be so great in the largest mammals that the heart would be faced with an
impossible task.
Cardiac output must increase during exercise to satisfy the increased oxygen needs of the
body (see Section 3.2.1). If, for example, the oxygen content of mixed venous blood is 15%
by volume, and that of arterial blood is 20% by volume, each 100 m3 of blood yields 5 m3 of
oxygen to the tissues. With a total body oxygen consumption of 4.2 x 10-6 m3/sec
(250 mL/min), 5 x 10-3 m3 (5 L) of blood is required. Cardiac function during exercise is
illustrated by data given in Table 3.2.8. Stroke volume increases, levels off, and then falls
somewhat due to inadequate ventricular filling at high heart rates. Heart rate increases
monotonically to result in increased cardiac output.
There is also a redistribution of blood flow within and between organs during exercise,
from those organs relatively inactive to those with greater metabolic demands. These changes
are given in Table 3.2.3.
Energetics. As fast as it beats, the heart should be expected to consume a good deal of
energy. Indeed, the heart requires just under 10% of the body's resting energy expenditure (see
Table 5.2.19). The transformation of chemical to mechanical energy by the heart is reflected
only to a small extent by the external work done on the blood; most of it is dissipated as heat
(Michie and Kline, 1976).
External work by the heart on the blood is given by a pressure energy and kinetic energy

Internal work, or physiological work done by the muscle in developing tension, does not
necessarily show up as external work. Isometric31 muscle contraction, for instance, does not
result in any external work but does represent a physiological oxygen cost (see Section 5.2.5).
The length-tension relationship for cardiac muscle tissue (Figure 3.2.9) shows that muscle
tension depends on the amount of stretching to which the muscle is subjected. In the heart, this
translates into the amount of blood in the ventricular chambers before systole begins. Thus the
amount of internal work of the heart depends partly on the end-diastolic volume of blood in
the ventricles.
The other determinant of internal work is external work. The higher the level of external
work, the higher is internal work. Muscular mechanical efficiency is defined as

η=

external mechanical work
total energy used

(3.2.50)

where η = mechanical efficiency, dimensionless
Mechanical efficiency of the heart is quite low, being 3-15%, and may rise to 10-15% when
external work is increased (Michie and Kline, 1976). Thus when external work is doubled,
internal work is also nearly doubled. With no external work performed, internal work will be
minimal; with high blood pressures to overcome, or with the myocardium in a
disadvantageous position on the length-tension relationship, internal work will be very high.32
Studies have shown that (1) stroke volume can be delivered with a minimum
myocardial shortening if the contraction begins at a larger volume; (2) internal energy usage is
lower for a heart at larger volume; (3) higher blood pressures can be attained by stretched
muscle fibers; (4) lower amounts of energy are used for slower contraction times (lower heart
rate); and (5) the greater the heart volume, the higher the muscle tension required to sustain a
given intraventricular pressure (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). All but the last factor indicates
that a more efficient cardiac output would occur with higher stroke volume and lower heart
rate. This has been seen to be the trend for trained athletes. For the cardiac patient, large
diastolic filling is sometimes accompanied by small stroke volume and high heart rate. Heart
dilatation gives improved ability of the muscle fibers to produce tension as long as they are
stretched (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). However, the high heart rate and the high muscle
tension combine to use more oxygen than the capillaries of the heart can deliver during mild
exercise.33 The result is myocardial hypoxia with symptoms of angina pectoris.
It has been reported that left ventricular oxygen consumption is correlated with the
product of mean ventricular ejection pressure and the duration of ejection (Michie and Kline,
1976). This is called the tension-time index.
Factors that constitute oxygen consumption (proportional to physiological work) of
the heart during each beat are (1) resting oxygen consumption, (2) activation oxygen
consumption, (3) contraction oxygen consumption, and (4) relaxation oxygen consumption
(Michie and Kline, 1976). Resting oxygen consumption is used to maintain the muscle in its
healthy, normal relaxed state. Activation oxygen consumption is that used by the muscle as
the muscle is excited by a depolarization and repolarization wave (see Sections 1.3.1 and
2.2.2). Contraction oxygen consumption includes internal and external work associated with
the development of muscle tension. Relaxation energy is a small (approximately 9%) amount
of energy required for the muscle to return to its relaxed state (Michie and Kline, 1976).
Power output by the heart, assuming in Equation 3.2.48 a left ventricular systolic
pressure of 16 kN/m2, a stroke volume of 70 x 10-6 m3 , a heart rate of 1.2 beats/sec, a right

Muscle tension produced at constant length.
The term preload is often used to describe the effect of initial fiber length, determined by intraventricular pressure and
volume. Afterload is the term used to account for the external pressure developed by the ventricle. It is determined by
intraventricular pressure and wall thickness, vascular resistance and pressure, and force-velocity relationship of the myocardium
(Michie and Kline, 1976).
33
While the cardiac muscle is contracting, capillaries in the muscle are being squeezed, allowing less blood to flow.

systolic pressure of one-sixth of the left ventricle, and a 10% increase to account for kinetic
power, is about 1.8 N·m/sec (Michie and Kline, 1976). During exercise, when maximum
systolic pressure may exceed 26.7 kN/m2 and heart rate may be 2.5 beats/sec, kinetic power
accounts for about 20% of the total cardiac power of about 8.4 N·m/sec (Michie and Kline,
1976).
It has been suggested (Hämäläinen, 1975) that blood flow and pressure can be predicted
based on an optimization process. This seems to indicate that, like respiration (see Section
4.3.4), cardiodynamics are driven by a control system that tends to limit the amount of work
expended during each cycle. Hämäläinen suggested a cost functional of

3.3 CARDIOVASCULAR CONTROL

Cardiovascular control exhibits classic elements of feedback control mechanisms. There are
sensors, a central controller, and actuator mechanisms. Cardiovascular control, however, has
been recognized to occur on many levels (involving local control responses as well as
responses imposed from central nervous system sites) and to many different organs (the
capillaries, arterioles, and heart, for instance). It should be realized that cardiovascular control
is composed of interrelated subunits which are integrated in such a manner as to maintain
adequate chemical supply first to the brain and then to other bodily structures despite levels of
demand that may vary by several orders of magnitude.
A general scheme for maintenance of blood pressure appears in Figure 3.3.1 (Scher,
1966b). Since blood pressure is
p = (HR) (SV) (R)

(3.3.1)

Figure 3.3.1 General scheme for regulation of blood pressure. Dashed lines indicate neural
communication and solid lines indicate direct mechanical effect. Sensing occurs in the carotid and aortic
baroreceptors, control in the central nervous system cardiac centers, and responses in the heart and
vasculature. New evidence (Stone et al., 1985) also suggests links from the heart and working muscles
which influence cardiovascular control.

blood pressure can be maintained by changing heart rate, stroke volume, or peripheral
vascular resistance. Table 3.3.1 includes typical values for these variables and shows that
heart rate during exercise usually increases greatly and vascular resistance greatly decreases.
Stroke volume does not change much. To decrease vascular resistance, most blood vessels
must open wider. However, the storage vessels must close, because otherwise sufficient
amounts of blood would not quickly return to the heart. This is just one illustration of the
sometimes contradictory demands placed on the cardiovascular system to reestablish stable
equilibrium.
3.3.1

Neural Regulation

These responses are coordinated through the central nervous system by means of
cardiovascular sensors, a central controller, and various responsive organs.
Sensors. There are several different types of sensors which provide input for cardiovascular
control. There is first a general class of mechanoreceptors comprised of stretch receptors and
baroreceptors. Stretch receptors exist in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, baroreceptors are
located in both branches of the pulmonary artery, and volume receptors are in the left and
right atria. These receptors, especially in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, generally function
in the maintenance of adequate arterial pressure.
The firing rate of these sensors reflects mean pressure as well as rates of changes in pressure.
For the carotid sinus stretch receptors, the rate of impulses has been expressed (Attinger,
1976b) as

f = β+

d p −d p

β+, β– = sensitivity coefficients, m2/N
β0 = sensitivity coefficient, m2/(N·sec)
The magnitudes of threshold pressure and sensitivity coefficients vary with level of mean
pressure. The relationship between the mean sinus pressure and average carotid sinus
baroreceptor neural firing rate is sigmoid (Figure 3.3.2) with normal blood pressure in the
midportion of the curve (Ganong, 1963) where the sensitivity (rate of change of firing rate to
rate of change of mean arterial pressure) is greatest. Pulsating pressures result in greater firing
rates.

Figure 3.3.2 Average firing rate of a single carotid baroreceptor unit responding to arterial pressure.
There is both an influence of pressure and rate of change of pressure on firing rate. (Adapted and used
with permission from Korner, 1971.)

There are also arterial peripheral chemoreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus
sensitive to arterial pO2, pCO2, and pH (Attinger, 1976b). Although they are more important in
the regulation of respiration, they do influence cardiovascular responses in extreme
circumstances.
There appears to be a very small cardiovascular influence, as well, from other peripheral
sensors. Lung inflation receptors represent the largest group of vagal afferent sources
(Attinger, 1976b) and, since the heart is also innervated by the vagus, may play a role in the
interaction seen between respiration and cardiac output. Somatic inputs through the trigeminal
nerve are important in relation to the diving and nasal circulatory reflexes.34
Controller. The heart is capable of generation of its basic rhythm in the absence of external
neural inputs and can maintain some local regulation of its output. However, the
cardiovascular controller must integrate numerous pieces of afferent information into a
coherent strategy for effective cardiovascular response. Much of this integration occurs in the
reticular substance of the lower pons and upper medulla (Figure 3.3.3) and is called the
vasomotor center. Its lateral portions are continuously sending efferent signals to partially
contract the blood vessels (vasomotor tone). The medial part of the center transmits inhibitory
signals to the lateral part, which results in vasodilation (Attinger, 1976b). The lateral
vasomotor center also transmits impulses through sympathetic nerve fibers to the heart, which
results in cardiac acceleration and increased contractility (Attinger, 1976b). The inhibitory
center, on the other hand, is connected to the heart via the parasympathetic35 fibers of the
vagus nerve and tends to slow heart rate and relax the myocardium (Figure 3.3.4).
The entire cardiovascular regulatory system is not localized in one section of the central
nervous system (Smith, 1966). The vasomotor center is normally influenced by peripheral
baroreceptor and chemoreceptor inputs, central nervous system chemoreceptor inputs, the
34
The diving reflex is an apparently primordial action which results in a significant lower heart rate when the face is suddenly
chilled.
35
The sympathetic nervous system is involved in reactions to stress; these include increasing heart rate, respiration rate,
sweating, and secretion of adrenaline. The parasympathetic system is normally antagonistic to the sympathetic system and is
used to maintain resting homeostasis: slow heart rate, maintaining gastrointestinal activity, and promoting balanced endocrine
secretions. The sympathetic system acts on beta adrenergic receptors of the heart, whereas the parasympathetic system acts on
gamma receptors.

Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus, for example, results in bradycardia. and a fall in
blood pressure. As another example, heart rate increases during strong emotion (cortex and
hypothalamic inputs). Some information is transmitted to efferent fibers at the level of the
spinal cord, but these reflexes usually do not interfere with higher level control.
Every control system must have a controlled variable. In the case of cardiovascular

control, as in the cases of most other controlled systems discussed in this book, maintenance
of a normal operating environment for the brain appears to be the controlled variable.
The cerebral vessels possess very little vasodilatory innervation, which is of little
functional importance. Instead, regulatory mechanisms maintain total cerebral blood flow
under widely varying conditions.36 Total cerebral blood flow is not increased by strenuous
mental activity, and it does not decrease during sleep. One reason for this may be that oxygen
consumption of the human brain is very high, averaging 5.8 x 10-8 m3/sec (3.5mL/min) per
gram brain tissue, or 82 x 10-8 m3/sec (49mL/min) for the whole brain in an adult (Ganong,
1963). This figure represents approximately 20% of the total resting oxygen consumption
(Table 3.3.2). Brain tissue is extremely sensitive to anoxia, and unconsciousness occurs about
10 seconds after the blood supply is interrupted.
When blood flow to the brain is decreased, cardiovascular control mechanisms quickly
attempt to return it to normal. For instance, if intracranial pressure is somehow elevated to
more than 4400 N·m2 (33 mm Hg), cerebral blood flow is soon significantly reduced (Ganong,
1963). The resultant ischemia stimulates the vasomotor center and systemic blood pressure
rises. As intracranial pressure is made to increase further, systemic blood pressure rises
proportionately.
Similarly, local changes in CO2 and O2 partial pressures in the blood can change cerebral
blood flow. A rise in pCO2 exerts a profound vasodilator effect on the arterioles. A low pO2
will likewise cause vasodilation. Low pCO2 or high pO2 results in mild vasoconstriction.37
These effects result in a certain degree of autoregulation of blood flow to maintain the
chemical milieu of the brain within tolerable limits. It therefore appears likely that the most
sensitively regulated area is the brain, and that most cardiovascular regulatory responses are
those associated with maintaining homeostasis of the brain.
Effector Organs. All blood vessels with the exception of capillaries and venules are
innervated by sympathetic autonomic nerve fibers. The arterioles and other resistance vessels
are the most densely innervated. Resistance of these vessels is regulated to control tissue
blood flow and arterial pressure. The veins, which act as capacitance, or storage, vessels
(Table 3.2.2), are regulated to control the amount of stored blood. Venoconstriction and
arteroconstriction occur together, shifting blood to the arterial side of the circulation. In
addition, vasoconstriction in the gastrointestinal area decreases blood flow to the
gastrointestinal system, liver, and spleen. Other important blood reservoirs at rest are the skin
and lungs. During severe exercise, constriction of the vessels in these organs, as well as
decreased blood volume in the liver and splanchnic bed, may increase actively circulating
blood volume perfusing the muscles by as much as 30% (Table 3.2.3). Thus vascular
innervation causes two types of physical control response: (1) peripheral resistance changes to
maintain blood pressure regulation and (2) blood distribution changes to maintain blood flow
to tissues which require delivery of metabolites and oxygen.
Beneken and DeWit (1967) discussed with unusual clarity the role of peripheral
resistance control in local and systemic regulation. Central nervous system regulation of
peripheral arterial resistance occurs when arterial pressure changes and is due to baroreceptor
sensing of central blood pressure. Vasoconstriction occurs when arterial pressure falls;
therefore, central nervous system control can be thought of as a pressure-controlling system.
Autoregulation, the local response to inadequate tissue nutrition, allows local vascular
beds to open to increase blood flow. Autoregulation mainly serves to ensure an adequate
distribution of cardiac output to the various parts of the body and is so local that it has almost
no direct effect on heart action and total cardiac output. Central nervous system control of
arterial blood flow can be overridden by autoregulation when local tissue oxygen consumption
exceeds blood oxygen delivery. Thus autoregulation can be thought of as a flow-controlling
system.
36
Cerebral blood flow in adults averages 9 x 10-6 m3/sec (0.54L/min) per kilogram brain tissue with a normal range of 6.7-11.2 x
106 m3/(sec·kg) (0.40-0.67 L/kg min) (Ganong, 1963).
37
The unconsciousness that results from severe hyperventilation is the result of arteriolar hypocaphic vasoconstriction, reducing
the blood flow to parts of the brain.


105

The other major effector organ is the heart itself. Heart rate is slowed by continual firing
of the vagus and speeded by sympathetic nervous discharge.38 When sympathetic firing
increases, vagus firing usually decreases. Thus the heart, which is the ultimate source of blood
pressure, can be made to increase or decrease blood pressure as required.39 As we saw in
Tables 3.2.8 and 3.3.1, stroke volume does not greatly change during exercise. Increasing
heart rate thus is the major means of increasing cardiac output. Coordinated control of blood
pressure occurs with concomitant increases in heart rate and total peripheral resistance:
p = VCR

(3.3.3)

Reflexes. Among the most important of the reflex actions that occur is the systemic arterial
baroreceptor reflex. If arterial pressure falls for some reason, heart rate immediately increases
and peripheral vascular resistance also increases. A common example of the occurrence of this
reflex is the response to standing after lying down. The head and feet are at the same level as
the heart in a supine individual, and thus mean arterial blood pressure is nearly constant
throughout the body at 13.3 kN/m2 (100 mm Hg). When standing, arterial blood pressure at
the level of the heart is still 13 kN/m2, but the gravitational effect causes arterial blood
pressure in the feet to be nearly 26 kN/m2 and at the level of the head to be 8-9 kN/m2. Blood
also pools in the venous capacitance vessels of the lower extremities. If there were no
compensatory mechanisms, cerebral blood flow would fall below 60% of the flow in the
recumbent position, and unconsciousness would follow (Ganong, 1963).
Central arterial pressure is sensed by the baroreceptors mainly in the carotid sinus and
aortic arch. Standing after lying has the effect of increasing heart rate by about 25 beats/min
and increasing total peripheral resistance by about 25% (Table 3.3.3).40 There are quite
different effects on different local vascular beds, however. There are significant changes in the
vascular resistance of the splanchnic and muscular beds but practically none in the skin
vessels (Attinger, 1976b). The operation of the baroreflex appears to be relatively independent
of central neural influences (Attinger, 1976b).
There is an inverse correspondence between carotid sinus pressure and systemic arterial
pressure; that is, an increase in carotid sinus pressure causes a corresponding decrease in

Both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems directly affect heart rate. This rate action is called a chronotropic effect.
Stimulation by the sympathetic system, moreover, increases myocardial contractility. This is called a positive inotropic effect.
39
The vagus can affect heart rate very rapidly. Sympathetic control, however, is relatively slow (Scher, 1966b).
40
Since vagal heart rate response is much faster than sympathetic response, initial compensation to postural change is likely to
be vagal. Sympathetic effects on heart rate and blood vessel resistance occur later (Scher, 1966b).

Figure 3.3.5 Relationship between mean carotid sinus pressure and mean systemic arterial pressure. The
similarity between these two pressures and the neural output from the carotid sinus (Figure 3.3.2) should
be noted. (Adapted and used with permission from Korner, 1971.)

arterial pressure. There is a strong similarity between the carotid sinus firing rate curve
(Figure 3.3.2) and the systemic pressure response curve (Figure 3.3.5) when the systemic
pressure response curve is inverted.
Incremental gain of the system, usually defined as change in output divided by change of
input, varies with pressure. It is a maximum where the slope of the systemic pressure response
curve is a maximum.41 In Figure 3.3.5, this occurs at nearly normal carotid sinus pressure of
16.7 kN/m2 [data for dog (Scher, 1966b)].
Since incremental gain is not constant, it is not surprising that the arterial pressure
response for a pulsatile pressure is not the same as for a constant pressure. Since incremental
gain decreases away from a pressure corresponding to gain maximum, arterial pressure
response is lower for a pressure pulsating between maximum gain pressure and some lower
pressure.
Since pressures are sensed at two main locations (carotid sinus and aortic arch), it is of
interest to know that somewhat the same systemic arterial response can be obtained from
increased pressure on any one location. That is, the magnitude of the overall effect does not
correspond to the algebraic sum of the individual effects (Attinger, 1976b) but instead appears
to be a case of biological redundancy. The open-loop gain of the aortic arch appears to be onequarter to one-half that of the carotid sinus receptors (Burton, 1965).
Scher (1966b) has given an analysis of the systemic arterial baroreceptor reflex. An
approximation to the variable gain in Figure 3.3.5 is

To account for the effects of pulsatile pressure, where a varying carotid sinus pressure
decreases the resulting arterial pressure despite maintenance of a constant mean pressure, a
recitification equation has been proposed. Also included in this equation is the observation
that as the frequency or amplitude of these changes increases, arterial pressure falls further
(Scher, 1966b).

Finally, to describe the pressure response to transient changes, notably square- and sinewave inputs, Scher (1966b) presents a linear approximation. Response to an input pressure
square wave is composed of a 2-4.5 sec period before any response, followed by an early
overshoot and then a slow (up to 100 sec) decline to the new level.

There are other cardiovascular reflexes with neural origin. A pulmonary artery
baroreceptor reflex primarily controls respiration by reducing ventilation by approximately
20% for each 130 N/m2 rise in pulmonary arterial pressure; cardiovascular effects become
significant when arterial pressure change exceeds 8 kN/m2 (Attinger, 1976b). Cardiac
mechanoreceptor reflexes are similar to, but much weaker than, the carotid sinus reflex; when
strongly stimulated, epicardial and ventricular receptors produce bradycardia, hypotension,
and reduced respiration (Attinger, 1976b). The arterial chemoreceptor reflex most strongly
affects respiration, but it does have cardiovascular consequences; hypoxia and hypercapnia
result in bradycardia, total peripheral resistance increase, arterial blood pressure increase, and
catecholamine secretion increase.
Heart rate is accelerated, and consequent blood pressure is increased, by decreased
baroreceptor activity, respiratory inspiration, excitement, anger, painful stimuli, anoxia,
exercise, and humoral agents (Faucheux et al., 1983; Lindqvist et al., 1983). Heart rate is
slowed by increased baroreceptor activity, expiration,42 fear, grief, the diving reflex, and
increased intracranial. pressure (Ganong, 1963). Tranel et al. (1982) demonstrated that
monetary rewards were sufficient to cause significant changes in heart rate when they were
given to test subjects for desired heart rate modifications.
3.3.2

Humoral Regulation

Not all cardiovascular regulation is neural. Circulating hormones, metabolites, and regulators
also have cardiovascular effects. These are effective mostly at the local level. For instance,
42
Mehlsen et al. (1987) report that suddenly initiated (stepwise) inspiration and expiration both resulted in an increase in heart
rate followed by a rapid decrease in heart rate. Heart rate was thus seen to respond to changes in lung volume. Coherent changes
in heart rate and breathing are commonly referred to as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (Kenney, 1985).


108

chemical substances that directly act on arteriole muscle fibers to cause local vasodilation are
decreased oxygen partial pressure, decreased blood and tissue pH, increased carbon dioxide
pressure (especially vasodilates the skin and brain), lactic acid, and adenylic acid (Ganong,
1963).43 Histamine released from damaged cells dilates capillaries and increases their permeability (Ganong, 1963). Bradykinin secreted by sweat glands, salivary glands, and the exocrine
portion of the pancreas vasodilates these secreting tissues (Ganong, 1963).
Other substances cause vasoconstriction. Injured arteries and arterioles constrict from
serotonin liberated from platelets sticking to vessel walls (Ganong, 1963). Norepinephrine has
a general vasoconstrictor action. Diurnal variations of norepinephrine have been found to be
associated with a mean arterial blood pressure 3700 N/m2 (28 mm Hg) lower during the
middle of the night than during the day (Richards et al., 1986). Epinephrine is also a general
vasoconstrictor in all but the liver and skeletal muscle, which it vasodilates. The net effect of
epinephrine is thus a decrease in total peripheral resistance (Ganong, 1963).
Norepinephrine and epinephrine both increase the force and rate of contraction of the
isolated heart (Ganong, 1963). Norepinephrine increases systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
which, in turn, stimulates the aortic and carotid sinus barorecptors to produce bradycardia,
leading to decreased cardiac output. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and thyroxin all increase
heart rate (Ganong, 1963). It is likely that prostaglandins will also be found to have
cardiovascular regulatory roles.
3.3.3

Other Regulatory Effects

Other effects are locally important in cardiovascular regulation. We have already noted
Starling's law (Section 3.2.3), which increases the contractility of myocardium in response to
preload. This is important for equalization of cardiac output between the left and right hearts.
Temperature is also an important cardiovascular regulator. High environmental
temperature or fever increases heart rate. A rise in temperature in muscle tissue directly causes
arteriole vasodilation (Ganong, 1963).
Total blood volume is controlled indirectly through capillary pressure (see Section 3.2.2).
When capillary pressure increases, fluid leaks into the cellular interstitium. When capillary
pressure falls below its normal value of about 3300 N/m2, fluid is absorbed into the circulatory
system. Capillary pressure is controlled indirectly by the same artery and venous innervation
that controls blood pressure.
Renal output also can be used to control total blood volume.44 Hemorrhage usually results
in a large reduction of urinary output, and fluid infusion stimulates urinary production. These
adjustments are long term, however, and require a day or more to complete; capillary fluid
shift requires only a few hours (Beneken and DeWit, 1967).
This mix of neural, humoral, and other local mechanisms allows cardiovascular
adjustments to be very efficient. The redundancy of effects underscores the importance of the
cardiovascular system.
3.3.4

Exercise

All previously presented effects are manifested during exercise (Hammond and Froelicher,
1985). Exercise increases carbon dioxide production by the muscles, which, in turn, increases
venous pCO2, and this stimulates cardiovascular responses. Heart rate increases, stroke

volume remains nearly the same, and cardiac output increases (Figure 3.3.6). The increase in
heart rate is nearly linear with work rate (Equation 3.2.42),45 except near maximum oxygen
uptake where gains in oxygen uptake depend not only on the amount of blood delivered to
the tissues (as indicated by heart rate) but also on the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood
(as indicated by pO2). Venous pO2 falls near maximum oxygen uptake, meaning that the
muscles are increasing oxygen use without a concomitant increase in heart rate.
Blood volume is moved from the venous side of the heart to the arterial side during
exercise. Stroke volume may actually fall during maximal exercise because venous return is
insufficient to completely fill the atrium during each heartbeat. Venous return is enhanced by
muscle pumping.
Cardiac output, composed of stroke volume and heart rate, increases to a maximum value
at maximal oxygen uptake. If no differences in arterial-to-venous pO2 occur, oxygen uptake is
directly related to cardiac output.
The increase in heart rate occurring at the beginning of exercise is very rapid (Figure
3.3.7). Sometimes the increase even precedes the start of exercise, which indicates that neural
control from higher nervous centers (through the sympathetic nervous system), rather than
arterial pO2 or pCO2 changes, are at least temporarily dominant (see Jones and Johnson, 1980;
Mitchell, 1985; Perski et al., 1985).
The increase of heart rate is higher for a given oxygen uptake for arm exercise compared
to leg exercise. Moving the arms above the head increases heart rate more than moving the
arms below the neck. Static (isometric) exercise increases heart rate disproportionately to that
expected from oxygen uptake alone.
Increased muscle temperature, increased carbon dioxide concentration, decreased pH, and
decreased oxygen concentration all have local vasodilatory effects. Blood flow through
working muscle is thus increased. Central nervous system control of vessel caliber is added to
local effects, thus shifting blood flow from regions with lower oxygen demand (especially the
viscera) to regions with higher demand. Total peripheral resistance decreases. Because of this,
diastolic pressures may actually decrease (although they may increase) somewhat despite
higher blood flows (Comess and Fenster, 1981). Systolic pressures increase and mean blood
pressure increases during exercise.
Females generally tend to exhibit higher heart rates than males at comparable percentages
of maximal oxygen uptake. Trained athletes have no higher maximum heart rates than
untrained individuals.46 However, they usually develop larger hearts capable of delivering
larger stroke volumes. For any rate of oxygen uptake, athletes' hearts are able to deliver the
required output with lower heart rates than can untrained individuals.
The cardiac hypertrophy developed in trained individuals is difficult to distinguish from
similar conditions developed by individuals with impaired cardiac function (Schaible and
Scheuer, 1985). The athletic heart, however, exhibits enhanced performance,47 whereas
pathologic cardiac hypertrophy is an adjustment made by parts of the heart to overcome
shortcomings of other parts of the cardiovascular system.
Chemical changes that occur improve oxygen transport to the muscles (including the
myocardium). The hemoglobin dissociation curve (Figures 3.2.1 through 3.2.3) shifts with
increased pCO2, decreased pH, and increased temperature to deliver oxygen with greater ease
to the working muscles. That is, for any given percentage saturation, the factors just cited tend
to increase plasma pO2 and allow more O2 to move into the interstitial fluid and muscle cells.
Muscle oxygen consumption, by these mechanisms, can increase above resting values by
75-100 times. Even higher increases are possible for very limited amounts of time by utilizing
anaerobic metabolism.
45

Except for an additional increment of heart rate increase with increased deep body temperature (see Section 3.4.5).
Erikssen and Rodahl (1979) showed that seasonal variations in physical fitness can exist in a population. Because of this,
comparisons of results between exercise tests conducted at different times of the year may be invalid.
47
This cardiac condition is even marked by electrocardiographic (ECG) signals that resemble those from severely ill patients.

appears to change with a single time constant, but diastolic and systolic pressures overshoot and decay
toward their final values.

3.3.5

Heat and Cold Stress

Responses to heat involve cardiovascular mechanisms, most of which are described in Section
5.3.3. Vascular adjustments to heat allow more blood to reach the skin, where heat can be
exchanged with the environment (Brengelmann, 1983). Cardiac adjustments include an
increased heart rate when deep body temperature rises. Over a period of several days'
exposure to elevated environmental temperatures, plasma volume increases to accommodate
the dual demands upon the blood of heat loss and oxygen and nutrient supply to the muscles.
There are times when these dual demands cause conflict. When these adjustments cannot
remove sufficient body heat, the condition of heat stroke occurs. Exactly why this occurs is
open to speculation, but Hales (1986) describes the scenario in this way. The diversion of
blood to the skin and the increase in cardiac output accompanying extreme heat stress greatly
reduce the volume of blood in the veins supplying the heart. This reduction in central venous
pressure is sensed by low-pressure baroreceptors and is responded to by a marked skin
vasoconstriction. This greatly reduces the ability of the body to lose heat and a thermal
overload results. Others (Brück, 1986; Kirsch et al., 1986; Senay, 1986; Wenger, 1986) have
given further evidence that at times the maintenance of blood pressure takes precedence over
heat loss, resulting in cutaneous vasoconstriction.

reaches a maximum and remains at that value. Heart rate climbs almost perfectly linearly with severity of
exercise. (Adapted and used with permission from Astrand and Rodahl, 1970.)


112

Cardiovascular responses to cold environments are characterized by cutaneous
vasoconstriction to maintain body heat. Wagner and Horvath (1985) reported that men
exposed to cold air reacted with increased stroke volume and decreased heart rate. Women
exposed to the same environments showed no such change [although Stevens et al. (1987)
reported heart rate decreases in men but a slight increase in women, both exposed to cold
stress]. Total peripheral resistance of older subjects exposed to cold environments increased
more than did that of younger subjects (Wagner and Horvath, 1985). The increase in
resistance was so great, in fact, that the resulting increase in mean arterial pressure could
cause difficulties for hypertensive48 or angina-prone49 individuals exposed to the cold. They
also reported a 10% increase in cardiac output to service increased oxygen demands of
shivering.
3.4 CARDIOVASCULAR MECHANICAL MODELS

Cardiovascular mechanical models are intended to conceptualize the mechanics of the
cardiovascular system. For physiologists, these models are more likely to be in pictorial or
graphic form; for bioengineers, these models are more likely to be mathematical in nature. All
models of biological systems must include the essentials of the processes described, but these
models must be simplifications of reality. Because the cardiovascular system is complicated
and includes much of the physical body, cardiovascular models have generally been limited to
descriptions of one or two aspects of the system. We have already seen at least one model of
this type in the discussion of the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect in very small blood vessels
(Section 3.2.2).
Attempts have been made to incorporate cardiodynamics into models of the vascular tree
to predict parameters which can be compared to experimental observations. These attempts
have included lumped-parameter mechanical models and distributed-parameter mechanical
models.50
Use of limited models for prediction of exercise results is not very productive because of
the all-inclusive nature of exercise response. We deal with some of these limited models only
because it is possible that they might become elements in more comprehensive cardiovascular
models. Several general cardiovascular mechanics models are described. We also briefly
discuss optimization models in the heart. Finally, two models of a more unrefined, but perhaps
useful nature, dealing with heart rate response to exercise challenge, are discussed.
3.4.1

Robinson's Ventricle Model

Heart mechanics, especially those of the left ventricle, have been the object of many models
(Perl et al., 1986; Sorek and Sideman, 1986a, b). Robinson's model (1965; Attinger, 1976c;
Talbot and Gessner, 1973) was developed to test changes of cardiac output with differences of
heart muscle mechanics as given by Starling's law (see Section 3.2.3). As such, it is a lumpedparameter mechanical model of the heart and blood vessels. Robinson began at the level of the
48
Hypertension is the term given to conditions marked by high blood pressure. Should blood pressure become too high, it can
overcome the strength of the walls of the blood vessels and blood would burst out into surrounding tissue. The thinning,
stretching, and bulging of weakened blood vessel walls is called an aneurysm, and when a ruptured aneurysm appears in the
brain a stroke may result.
49
Angina pectoris is the condition where severe chest pain due to ischemia (lack of oxygen leading to tissue necrosis) in the
myocardium is caused by inadequate coronary blood circulation.
50
Lumped-parameter models assume the entire model segment can be replaced by a very small number of elements, each
usually representing one property of the segment. Any spatial dependence of these properties is neglected. Nonlinearities can be
included, but waves and other spatial-temporal effects cannot be predicted. Distributed-parameter models are often similar to a
large number of lumped-parameter models of subsegments and, because they can account for spatial dependence of segment
properties, can reproduce wave behavior. Modeling the vascular system as one resistance, inertance, and compliance is an
example of a lumped-parameter model. A distributed-parameter model would include many resistance, inertance, and
compliance elements with many interconnections.

Figure 3.4.1 The three-element model of the myocardium. The output of the force source fc depends on
the length of the parallel element PE and its rate of shortening. Total muscle length equals the length of
PE and the shorter length of the series element SE. The force source is assumed to be active only during
systole and to be freely distensible in passive muscle. (Used with Permission from Talbot and Gessner,
1973.)

myocardium (Figure 3.4.1) by assuming each muscle fiber to be effectively given by a
contractile element in parallel with an elastic element and in series with another elastic
element (Mende and Cuervo, 1976; Phillips et al., 1982). The force source51 produces a force
magnitude depending on the length of the parallel elastic element and on its rate of shortening.
Total muscle fiber length is the length of the parallel element (or force source) plus the length
of the series element. When muscle fibers are combined into a ventricle model, force elements
are all lumped together and series elastic elements are lumped together. Thus the concept of
ventricular contraction consists of a force developed by the force elements forcing blood into
the elastic portion with concurrent pressure buildup (Figure 3.4.2). The rate of change of
volume (dV/dt) is limited by a resistance element which assumes a higher value (Rs) in systole
compared to diastole (Rd). Aortic valve resistance (Rav) to outflow and mitral valve resistance
(Rmv) to inflow are included. Series element compliance (Cse) is included in the elastic portion.
Robinson developed the following differential equation for intraventricular systolic
pressure. Beginning with a pressure balance on the ventricle, intraventricular pressure equals
the pressure developed by the muscle from which is subtracted pressure dissipated through
viscous resistance (actually negative, since dV/dt is negative during systole) and pressure used
to overcome compliance; since V = Cp, C(dp/dt) is equivalent to dV/dt,
p = p s + Rs

Force, pressure, voltage, and temperature are examples of effort variables. An ideal effort source is characterized by a constant
effort no matter what the flow. Hence ideal effort sources have zero internal impedances (impedance equals change in effort
divided by change in flow). Fluid flow, electrical current, and heat are examples of flow variables. Ideal flow sources are
characterized by constant flow rates no matter what effort must be expended to do so. Hence ideal flow sources have infinite
internal impedance.

Figure 3.4.2 Principal elements of a ventricle model including internal resistance, which limits outflow
velocity. Included are systolic and diastolic pressures (ps and pd), flow-limiting resistances during systole
and diastole (Rs and Rd), aortic valve and mitral valve resistance (Rav and Rmv), and a series element
compliance (Cse). Although this model divides the ventricle into two conceptual chambers, both together
represent the entire ventricle, that is, V = Vc + Ve. (Used with permission from Talbot and Gessner, 1973.)

During diastole, a similar pressure balance yields an equation nearly identical to that for
systole, with the exception that diastolic muscle pressure and viscous resistance replace those
for systole. Robinson chose to allow the change from Rs to Rd to occur smoothly at the
beginning of diastole by introducing the transition term ( R s − Rd )e -t/τd . Thus effective
resistance during diastole begins as Rs and decreases rapidly to Rd.52

Robinson solved his equations on an analog computer,53 which switched between systole
and diastole. Final values for ventricular volume V, intraventricular pressure p, and arterial
pressure pa during one stage were introduced as initial values during the next stage. After a
number of cycles, an equilibrium was reached wherein no further change was noted from one
cardiac cycle to the next, and this was taken to be the steady-state solution.
Robinson assumed a fixed heart rate of 2 bps, a ratio of systolic duration to diastolic
duration of 2:3, and a time constant (τd) value of 0.05 sec. Numerical values of other constants
for a 98.1 N (10 kg) dog are listed in Table 3.4.1. These values are based on experimental
observations from muscle fibers, which are difficult to obtain. Therefore, these values should
be considered approximate only.
The values of pressures developed by relaxed (pd) and contracting (ps) muscle were also
developed from experimental observations on isolated myocardial fibers. Robinson approximated the elastic properties of passive heart muscle as illustrated in Figure 3.4.3. Negative
pressures are required to decrease the volume below 5 cm3 and elastic elements become stiffer
at large volumes.

systole are given by the upper curve and data for diastole by the lower curve. The slope of a line drawn
from the origin to any point on the curve gives the inverse of the static compliance. At large volumes the
elastic elements in the heart become stiffer. Negative pressures are needed to reduce diastolic volume
below 5 cc. (Adapted and used with permission from Robinson, 1965.)

Total available isometric pressure ps is the sum of relaxed muscle pressure pd and

Atrial action was neglected in this study (Talbot and Gessner, 1973). The ventricle model
received blood from a simplified mathematical model of the pulmonary veins and delivered it
to a model of the systemic arterial circulation. The arterial circulation was approximated as a
lumped compliance in parallel with the total peripheral resistance (Equation 3.3.3) and in

Robinson found that ventricular flow was largely unaffected by changes in arterial
impedance. Thus the ventricle appears to act as a flow source where flow is largely
independent of peripheral load. When filling pressure was increased from 1866 N/m2 (14 mm
Hg) to 3333 N/m2 (25 mm Hg), stroke volume was found to increase linearly from 12 to 14
cm3, mean arterial pressure increased from 13.3 to 15.3 kN/m2, and stroke work increased
from 0.16 to 0.21 N·m. This is mathematical confirmation of Starling's law (see Section
3.2.3). The isolated ventricle model did not agree as well with experimental observations
when peripheral resistance instead of filling pressure was increased.
3.4.2

Comprehensive Circulatory System Model

The model presented by Sandquist et al. (1982) is a comprehensive mechanical model of the
entire human cardiovascular system. Three major subsystems of the heart, systemic
circulation, and pulmonary circulation are included. Model equations are based on
conservation of blood mass, conservation of energy of blood flow, conservation of momentum
of blood flow, and equations of state describing system compliance. This model is much more
comprehensive than that by Robinson, in that it includes more elaborate circulatory elements.
It does not, however, treat the left ventricle in as much detail as Robinson's model, and it does
not include the control aspects included in the model by Benekin and DeWit (1967) to be
presented in detail in Section 3.5. This model is mentioned here, however, because of the
clarity of its description, and the reader is referred to Sandquist et al. for an example of
construction methods in mathematical model building.

Vascular System Models

Many vascular system models have been proposed (Attinger, 1976c; Linehan and Dawson,
1983; Noordergraaf, 1978; Skalak and Schmid -Schönbein, 1986; Talbot and Gessner, 1973).
Most of these have been used to attempt to explain the temporal and spatial nature of pressure
waves appearing in the vascular tree. Although they may include the entire systemic

Figure 3.4.4 Transmission line analog of the arterial tree. Ri accounts for viscous resistance to fluid flow,
R′i accounts for shunt flow between arterial and venous circulation, Li accounts for inertance of flowing
blood and arterial tissue, and Ci accounts for compliance of arterial walls. These quantities, although not
completely distributed along the artery analog, are nevertheless included in small enough "lumps" to act
like a completely distributed parameter system.

Figure 3.4.5 Schematic diagram of the two-compartment model of Green and Jackman (1984). The
splanchnic compartment includes all blood flowing through the hepatic veins. The peripheral
compartment comprises all other blood, including blood in the working muscles. Both compartments
include elements of arterial resistance Ro, compliance C, and venous resistance Rv. Green and Jackman
used their simple model to simulate the effects of exercise on cardiac output. (Adapted and used with
permission from Green and Jackman, 1984.)


118

circulation from arteries through veins, most of these models do not elucidate mechanisms of
exercise. Indeed, it is within these models that distributed parameters are most likely to be
seen. Many researchers have extended the analogy between the systemic circulation and
transmission lines (Figure 3.4.4). The resulting equations, although simple, are very
numerous. Details are more likely to be reproduced with distributed parameters, but
conceptual understanding is easier to obtain from the compact form of a few simple equations
resulting from a lumped-parameter model. The reader is invited to look further into these
models, but their use in exercise currently is nearly nonexistent.
Green and Jackman (1984) presented a two-compartment lumped-parameter model which
depended strongly on vascular characteristics. The objective of their model was to predict
changes in cardiac output occurring during exercise. The model consisted of two parallel
vascular channels: the splanchnic channel, which included all blood flowing through the
hepatic vein, and the peripheral channel, which included all other vascular beds (Figure 3.4.5).
The exercise condition was simulated by decreasing compliances of both channels to 40% of
their resting values and by adjusting each resistance such that the percentage of total cardiac
output perfusing the splanchnic compartment fell from 38 to 5% while that perfusing the
peripheral compartment (including skeletal muscles) increased from 62 to 95%. These
combined changes increased total cardiac output from 7.3 x 10-5 to 37 x 10-5 m3/sec (4.4 to 22
L/min), a result very similar to that found in humans. This result was achieved with active
control exerted only on the vasculature and not on the heart.
3.4.4

Optimization Models

As discussed in Section 3.2.3, there is reason to suspect that cardiac events are determined by
processes which optimize these events. Of the possible optimization determinants, mechanical
energy expenditure is the one that has most recently received attention (Hämäläinen et al.,
1982; Livnat and Yamashiro, 1981; Yamashiro et al., 1979). The oxygen cost of moving
blood is very high—at least five times that for moving an equivalent amount of air
(Yamashiro et al., 1979)—and the respiratory system has been shown to operate in agreement
with a minimum energy expenditure criterion, so it is expected that ventricular ejection occurs
in a manner which reduces ventricular energy to a minimum.
Several attempts have been made to formulate and solve this problem to yield realistic
results. There is no reason to suspect that the current flurry of activity to include further
refinements is over. Therefore, while the model described here reasonably accurately predicts
ventricular systolic events, the promise of extensions to other cardiovascular events remains
strong.54
Livnat and Yamashiro (1981) presented a model for prediction of left ventricular dynamics
derived from a minimization of work expended during systole. Their model is seen in Figure
3.4.6. The ventricle and arterial load was assumed to consist of a time-varying ventricular
compliance Cv, blood inertia Ib, valvular resistances Rav and Rb, total peripheral resistance Rp,
and arterial compliance Cp. The equation of motion relating left ventricular pressure and aortic
pressure to left ventricular outflow is
p − p ao = ( Rav + Rb )

(3.4.7)

where p = intraventricular pressure, N/m2
pao = pressure in the ascending aerta, N/m2
Rav = constant aortic valve resistance, N·sec/m5
Rb = nonconstant aortic valve resistance, N·sec/m5
54

Indeed, Murray (1926) discussed the size of the blood vessels in relation to the work of the flow of blood through them, their
sizes seemingly determined to minimize the rates of work through them.

Figure 3.4.6 Electrical analog of the left ventricle and its arterial load. The ventricle is diagramed as a
time-varying mechanical compliance generating a ventricular pressure p. Blood is ejected through the
aortic valve, which has properties of a diode in series with a resistance, composed of a constant Rb and
nonconstant Rav term. Total systemic circulation is diagramed as a compliance Cp in parallel with a
resistance Rp. The combination of Rb and Rav, Cp, and Rp is commonly called the electrical analog of the
modified Windkessel model. (Used with permission from Livnat and Yamashiro, 1981.)

where ρ = blood density, kg/m3 or N·sec2/m4

Because it is the column of blood in the aorta that must be accelerated by the ventricle, the
value of blood inertance is the inertia of a column of blood having a length equal to that of the
left ventricular inner radius and diameter equal to the aortic diameter.
For the peripheral arterial circulation, a pressure balance gives

Equations 3.4.7 through 3.4.12 form a complete dynamic description of the left ventricle and
systemic arterial load.
A proper variable to be optimized would be myocardial oxygen consumption rather than
ventricular work. Livnat and Yamashiro (1981), however, chose to minimize external work
performed by the ventricle because oxygen consumption of the myocardium is very high and a
significant oxygen debt cannot be incurred. There is therefore a direct correspondence
between oxygen consumption and external work. Note, however, that ventricular isovolumic
contraction, basal oxygen consumption, and diastolic oxygen consumption were all ignored.
The cost functional55 suggested by Livnat and Yamashiro (1981) is composed of a wall
stress contribution to ventricular work, a term representing inotropic state contributing to the
rate of oxygen consumption, external mechanical pump work, and a term penalizing the
duration of contraction. In formulating the first term, Livnat and Yamashirc, assumed the
ventricle wall to be spherically shaped and thin. Equation 3.2.37 relates shear stress to the
dimensions of a cylinder. For a sphere shear stress is

τ=

pr
2∆ r

(3.4.13)

where τ = shear stress, N/m2
p = ventricular pressure, N/m2
r = ventricular radius, m
∆r = wall thickness, m
Expressing the sphere radius in terms of the volume,
 3  1 / 3 pV 1/ 3
τ = 
2∆ r
 4π 

(3.4.14)

Systolic work is proportional to the difference between wall shear stress (or tension) and
the shear stress present in the wall at the end of diastole (or beginning of systole), τ – τo.
Integrating the square of the shear stress difference over the entire surface area of the shell and
then integrating the resulting term over the entire time for systole gives a term representing
the stored elastic energy involved in the contraction process:
E1 =

where E1 = internal energy, N·m
τo = end-diastolic stress, N/m2
τs = period of systole, sec
α1 = constant, m3/(N·sec)
The second term in Livnat and Yamashiro's (1981) cost functional concerns the
contribution of inotropic state to the rate of oxygen consumption. They used an index of
contractility suggested by Bloomfield et al. (1972), which has been shown to be sensitive to

External work is given by

(3.4.17)

where E3 = external work, N·m
Further, Livnat and Yamashiro (1981) introduced a term to demonstrate the cost of a
myocardial contraction on cardiac blood flow. During systole, blood flow in the myocardium
suffers a mechanical interference from the contracting muscle. Strong contraction may stop
muscle blood flow entirely. Tissue oxygen partial pressure can fall to extremely low levels.
The longer the duration of contraction, the lower oxygen partial pressure will become.
For a given systolic time, oxygen content of the muscle will decrease as heart rate
increases. Therefore, a term is introduced to account for the reduction of oxygen availability
for systolic contraction:
E4 = [α3(HR) + α4]ts
(3.4.18)
where E4 = systolic contraction penalty, N·m
α3 = constant, N·m/beat
α4 = constant, N·m/sec
HR = heart rate, beats/sec
The entire cost functional, the expression to be minimized, is
J = E1 + E2 + E3 + E4

(3.4.19)

where J = cost functional, N·m

where pao = aortic pressure at the beginning of systole, N/m2
Vo = end-diastolic volume, m3
Vs = end-systolic volume, m3
The solution to be found involves the time course of ventricular pressure p which will
minimize the cost functional J. The term Rb injects a severe nonlinearity into Equation 3.4.7,
which precludes simple methods of analysis. The Pontryagin maximum principle (see
Appendix 3.2) was used to solve the preceding system of equations numerically. The reader is
referred to Livnat and Yamashiro (1981) for more details of the procedure.

appearing in the literature, especially from Robinson (1965), whose model of the left ventricle
we considered in Section 3.4.1.
The results obtained by Livnat and Yamashiro (1981) are indicated in Figure 3.4.7.
Ventricular systolic pressure predicted from their model is at least qualitatively similar to
experimental data from Greene et al. (1973). Comparison with experimental data from other
sources also showed reasonable agreement. Livnat and Yamashiro also included isovolumic
contraction in their ventricle model. Thus each ventricular contraction is considered to be
composed of an isovolumic period and an ejection period. Livnat and Yamashiro allowed the
time for each of these to be determined by their model. Figure 3.4.8 shows a comparison
between predicted and observed values of both periods in dogs as heart rate changes.
Predicted and observed data both show modest decreases as heart rate increases.
Heart failure was simulated by decreasing contractile energy and increasing end-diastolic
volume while maintaining cardiac output constant. Results appear in Table 3.4.3. Peak
ventricular pressure decreases sharply when myocardial strength is diminished. Both
isovolumic contraction and ejection times are significantly prolonged. As the heart weakens,
isovolumic contraction period lengthens and the Starling mechanism (see Section 3.2.3) must
be used to maintain the same level of stroke volume.
As previously discussed, the nonlinearity of this model posed difficulty for its solution.
Livnat and Yamashiro (1981) were obliged to use a blood inertance value 73% higher than the
experimentally observed value in order to assure stability of solution. Hämäläinen et al.
(1982) also point out that the model solution is very sensitive to boundary values used and that
care must be exercised in choosing proper values.
Hämäläinen and Hämäläinen (1985) further discussed this and other optimal control
models of ventricular function. They showed why complete solutions to the optimality
problem do not exist but could be obtained with other assumptions. Working from a set of
different boundary conditions, they showed that the ejection pattern with the peak flow in the
first half of ejection (e.g., that labeled experimental data in Figure 3.4.7) was optimal with
respect to minimizing work external to the ventricle. The difference in ventricular work
between the most efficient and least efficient patterns amounted to 4% of the optimum value.
Although this model is not yet suitable for inclusion in a global model predicting exercise
performance, it is a large step in that direction. Optimization models are used to predict
respiratory response to exercise (see Section 4.5.3), and the promise is that they will someday
be used in prediction of cardiovascular responses to exercise. Of particular interest is the

juxtaposition of concepts: oxygen consumption used to be thought of as a dependent variableits magnitude was dependent upon the rate of work. This model shows that oxygen
consumption can be pictured as determining, at least in part, the rate of work.
3.4.5

Heart Rate Models

Heart rate response to exercise is nearly linear. As presented in Equation 3.2.41, steady-state
heart rate response can be obtaind from oxygen consumption data by
 VO 
2
 ( HRmax – HRr)
HR = HRr + 
 VO max 
 2

where HR = steady-state heart rate response, beats/sec
HRr = resting heart rate, beats/sec
VO 2 = oxygen uptake, m3

(3.4.24)

and
HRmax = (220 - y)/60

(3.4.25)

where y = age, yr
Maximum oxygen uptake can be approximated by any of several empirical predictors such as
Equation 3.3.39, 3.2.40, or 3.2.41. Oxygen uptake for any given task can be roughly
calculated from other empirical equations (see Section 5.5.1) or by dividing external work rate
by an assumed muscular efficiency. For leg work, muscular efficiency can be assumed to be
20% (see Section 5.2.5). Thus steady-state heart rate response to exercise can be predicted
approximately.
Transient Response. Fujihara et al. (1973a, b) performed a series of experiments in which
they were able to determine heart rate transient response. They were careful to begin their
experiments at work rates higher than resting and terminate them before maximal efforts, thus
avoiding nonlinearities at both extremes of work rates. Five healthy nonathletic laboratory
personnel were studied. Impulse, step, and ramp loads were applied to the bicycle ergometer.
Good agreement between experimental observations and mathematical prediction was
obtained with the following step-response equation (Fujihara et al., 1973a):56

Since Fujihara et al. (1973b) presented their parameter values for a specific work rate
only, and since the steady-state change in heart rate in Equation 3.4.26 is given as (k1 + k2), it
appears reasonable to suppose that k1 and k2 will vary proportionately with workload. Thus

Heat Effects. Heart rate is influenced not only by the oxygen transport requirements of the
body but also by body temperature. This reflects the additional cardiovascular burden of
removing excess heat (as well as a small increase in oxygen demand to supply the increase in
chemical activity which occurs with a temperature increase; see Section 3.3.5 and 5.2.5).
Givoni and Goldman (1973a), obtaining experimental observations on young men in military
uniforms, proposed a series of equations to predict heart rate response to work, environment,
and clothing. For a more thorough discussion of the parameters involved in this model, the
reader is referred to Section 5.5.
Both body temperature and heart rate respond to environmental changes by transient
changes toward new final values. Of course, heart rate changes much more rapidly than body
temperature. Figure 3.4.10 shows the relationship between final heart rate for four different
studies. The relationship between these two demonstrates the predictability of one from the
other.
The body temperature model of Section 5.5 corrects body heat load for work done on the
external environment by the body.57 No such correction is necessary for heart rate because
heart rate responds to total oxygen demand, which includes that used to produce external
work.
There is a limit above which the relationship between body temperature and heart rate is
no longer linear. This limit occurs at a heart rate of about 2.50beats/sec. Above this limit,
body temperature can continue to increase (although the subject may expire before
equilibrium is reached) while heart rate approaches a maximum of 2.83-3.17 beats/sec. Givoni
and Goldman (1973a) assumed an exponential relationship between body temperature and
heart rate above this limit.
Based on empirical determination, Givoni and Goldman (1973a) gave, for heat-

(3.4.28)

where I = heart rate index, beats/sec
M = metabolic rate, N·m/sec (Equation 5.5.5)
Ccl = thermal conductance of clothing, N·m/(m2·sec·oC)
θa = ambient temperature, oC
Ereq = required evaporative cooling N·m/sec (Equation 5.5.8)
Emax = maximum evaporative cooling capacity of the environment, N·m/sec (Equation
5.5.9)

3.75 ≤ I

(3.4.31)

where HRf = equilibrium heart rate, beats/sec
From this system of equations, it is possible to separate the effect of exercise from the effect
of body temperature on equilibrium heart rate. The first term, (6.67 x 10-3) M, in Equation
3.4.28 represents the heart rate required to transport oxygen to support metabolism. The
remaining two terms are those dealing with thermal effects on heart rate. If an incremental
work rate of 5.75 N·m/sec requires an additional 0.29 m3 oxygen per second (1 L/hr), then an
extra 0.013 beats/sec is required (using Equation 3.4.30).
Givoni and Goldman (1973a) also estimated the transient responses to changes in work,
environment, and clothing. At rest, heart rate is assumed to begin at 1.08 beats/sec and
respond to changes with
HRr = 1.08 + (HRf – 1.08)[1 – exp(–t/1200)]

(3.4.32)

where HRr = heart rate during rest, beats/sec
ti = time, beginning at a change, sec
During work, the greater the stress, or the higher the equilibrium heart rate, the longer it takes
to reach the final level. Also, there is an initial elevation in heart rate when the resting subject
rises and anticipates work:
HRw = 1.08(HRf – 1.08)(1 – 0.8 exp{– [6 – 1.8(HRf – 1.08)]t / 3600})

(3.4.33)

where HRw = heart rate during work, beats/sec
t = time, beginning when work begins, sec
After cessation of work, heart rate decreases toward the equilibrium resting level appropriate
to the given climatic and clothing conditions. The rate of decrease depends on the total
elevation of heart rate above its resting level and on the cooling ability of the environment:
HRt = HRw – (HRw – HRr)e–kbt / 3600

(3.4.37)

where im = clothing permeability index, dimensionless
φa = ambient relative humidity, dimensionless
pamb = ambient water vapor pressure, N/m2
About a week of work in hot environments is required for nonacclimatized men to
become fully acclimatized to their environment (see Sections 5.3.5 and 5.5.2). Givoni and
Goldman (1973b) estimated the largest difference in heart rate between nonacclimatized and
fully acclimatized subjects to be about 0.67 beat/sec. It is thus necessary to modify Equations
3.4.26 and 3.4.27 to account for acclimatization effects; no difference in resting heart rate has
been noticed for acclimatization (Equation 3.4.29 remains the same).
Givoni and Goldman (1973a) assumed that equilibrium heart rate decreases exponentially
with the duration of work in the heat. Also, for very restricted evaporative conditions the
difference between acclimatized and nonacclimatized heart rate decreases exponentially with
maximum evaporative capacity of the environment:
HRf, n = HRf + 0.67 {1 – exp[– 2.4(HRf – 1.08)} [1 – exp(–0.005 Emax)] exp(–0.3N)

(3.4.38)

where HRf, n = equilibrium heart rate for individuals not fully acclimatized, beats/sec
HRf = equilibrium heart rate for fully acclimatized individuals, beats/sec
N = number of consecutive days spent working in hot environment, days
The number of consecutive days of work experience in the heat is to be reduced by one-half
day for each day missed. Transient heart rate response to rest, work, and recovery uses HRf, n
in place of HRf in Equations 3.4.31 through 3.4.34.

for each of these conditions.
Comparison Between the Two Heart Rate Models. Transient response of heart rate
was the subject for models by Fujihara et al. (1973a, b) and Givoni and Goldman (1973a, b).
Both were developed from experimental data, although a greater mass of data was used by
Givoni and Goldman. The difference between the two models lies in the time scale of
transient response to be predicted. If the time scale is measured in seconds, that is, if very
rapid heart rate events are to be predicted, the Fujihara et al. transient model should be used. If
the smallest increment of time is of the order of a minute or more, the Givoni and Goldman
formulation should be chosen.
3.5 CARDIOVASCULAR CONTROL MODELS
Aspects of cardiovascular control have stimulated many researchers to model development.
Many of these models have concentrated on particular, limited portions of the overall system.
For instance, Warner (1964) and others (Talbot and Gessner, 1973) presented models of
baroreceptors and their influence on blood pressure (see Section 3.3.1). Warner (1965)
modeled the effect of vagal stimulation on heart rate. Others (Talbot and Gessner, 1973)
modeled local vasodilatory effects of carbon dioxide and other metabolites as well as blood
volume changes due to net efflux or influx from capillary beds. A more global, but still
limited approach was taken by Grodins (1959, 1963), who modeled the left and right hearts,
systemic and pulmonary circulations, and resistances and compliances exhibited by the
vessels. There is no doubt that this model is useful in understanding of the passive,
uncontrolled cardiovascular system and its response to slow changes in pressures or flows, but
it lacks the overall grand nature of a model that reproduces large-scale changes in exercise.
The model by Baneken and DeWit (1967) provides the framework for an integrated study
of cardiovascular mechanics and control (Figure 3.5.1). This model includes the heart,
systemic circulation, pulmonary circulation, and cardiovascular control centers. Systemic
circulation is modeled as seven arterial segments including coronary blood flow, and cerebral,
thoracic, abdominal, and leg arteries. The superior vena cava, returning blood to the heart
from the head, and the inferior vena cava, returning blood to the heart from the lower body,
are included. Each vessel includes resistance to blood flow, distensibility, resistance of the
vascular wall to movement and inertance of the blood. In addition, venous valves are included
(diagramed, in Figure 3.5.1, by means of a diode). Blood flow pathways are shown
schematically as solid lines.
Neural pathways are shown as dashed lines. They include vasomotor effects on
peripheral vascular resistance, heart rate effects, and myocardial inotropic effects (changes in
contractility). Beneken and DeWit assumed vasomotor effects on peripheral resistances to be
proportionately equal for all segments. It is possible, however, for the model to shift blood
from one segment (e.g., viscera) to another (e.g., working muscle) through unequal
proportions of resistance change (Talbot and Gessner, 1973).

The Ventricles. The ventricles are modeled by Beneken and DeWit (1967) by describing the
relationship among left ventricular volume, pressure, inflow, and outflow. Continuity

simulate controlled circulation: heart, seven arterial (A0-A6) and six venous (V1-V4, inferior vena cava and
superior vena cava) segments on the systemic side; two segments and a fairly complex pulmonary
resistance on the pulmonary side. Solid lines indicate paths of blood flow. The diode indicates a valve in
the venous circulation. Peripheral resistances are labelled. Neural control circuits (dashed lines) involve
afferent paths from baroreceptors to vasomotor centers and efferent pathways to control peripheral
resistances (arrows) and ventricular performances. Blood volume change depends on precapillary and
postcapillary pressures.

Left ventricular pressure is related to pressure in the ascending aorta and ventricular outflow.
This relationship is found by means of an energy balance. Work performed by the left
ventricle when forcing blood into the ascending aorta is of the form pV; this work is dissipated
by viscous resistance, absorbed by aortic inertance, and stored as kinetic energy:
work = resistance energy + inertia energy + kinetic energy

Blood viscous pressure drop, RL VDoLV , is subsequently neglected by Beneken and DeWit
(1967) as being much smaller than the kinetic energy term. As previously mentioned (Section
3.4.3), blood inertance is computed as a column of blood having a length equal to the left

Intraventricular pressures are determined largely by muscular forces, which, in turn,
depend on ventricular shape. Pressures are thus related to ventricular volumes. Beneken and
Dewit (1967) assumed for the left ventricle a spherical shape with uniform wall thickness. The
right ventricle is assumed to be bounded by part of the outer surface of the left ventricle
together with a spherical free wall bent around part of the left ventricle (Figure 3.5.2).
Beneken and DeWit (1967) made the following assumptions in finding relations between
ventricular pressure and muscular force and between ventricular volume and muscle length:
(1) the muscle fibers have a uniformly directional distribution circumferential to the wall; (2)
the ventricular walls retain their spherical shape throughout the cardiac cycle; (3) the wall
material is isotropic and incompressible; and (4) the left ventricle determines the shape of the
interventricular septum—the right ventricle does not influence left ventricular shape.
Starting from these assumptions, and continuing through an analysis of the stress-strain
relationship of a thick-walled vessel (Talbot and Gessner, 1973), Beneken and DeWit give
pLV = SL (FL /ALU)

(3.5.11)

where SL = left ventricular shape factor, dimensionless
FL = force developed in myocardium, N
ALU = unstressed muscle cross-sectional area, m2
and
pRV = SR (FR /ARU)

(3.5.12)

where SR = right ventricular shape factor, dimensionless
FR = force developed in right ventricular wall, N
ARU = unstressed muscle cross-sectional area, m2
The value for ARU and ALU is taken as 10-6 m2 (1 mm2). Figure 3.5.3 is a graph of SL as a

Figure 3.5.2 Cross section of the assumed right and left ventricular configuration in the end-diastolic
state. The left ventricle is modeled as a thick-walled sphere and the right ventricle as a thin-walled

function of left ventricular volume. Details for calculations of SL, values can be found in
Talbot and Gessner (1973).
The forces FL and FR are dependent on muscle length and the velocity of shortening of
muscle length (see Section 5.2.5). Muscle length depends on ventricular volume. Normally,
based on dimensional considerations, it would be expected that muscle length would be
dependent on the cube root of the volume, but, because of the thick wall of the ventricle, there
is not quite a cube root relationship. Figure 3.5.4 shows the relationship between muscle
length normalized to end-diastolic length and left ventricular volume.
To determine the dependence of developed force on muscle fiber length, Beneken and
DeWit (1967) used a three-element heart muscle model, composed of a series elastic element,
a parallel elastic element, and a contractile element, identical to that used by Robinson
(Section 3.4.1) and seen in Figure 3.4.1. Total fiber length equals the length of the series
element Ls plus the length of the parallel element Lp:
L = Ls + Lp = Ls + Lc
where L

F = Fp + Fc

(3.5.14)

where F = total force, N
Fp = force developed by parallel elastic element, N
Fc = force developed by contractile element, N
The relationship between total force and length of the series elastic element of cat papillary
muscle appears in Figure 3.5.5. The forces developed by contractile and parallel element (see
Section 3.4.1) lengths appear in Figure 3.5.6. Contractile force appearing in Figure 3.5.6 is
maximum contractile force. When not activated, it is assumed that the contractile force is a
small fraction of the maximum contractile force:
Fmin = φ Fc max + Fp

(3.5.15)

where Fmin = minimum total force, N
Fc max = maximum contractile force, N
φ = dimensionless fraction
and
Fmax = (1 + φ)Fc max + Fp

(3.5.16)

where Fmax = maximum total force, N
A value of φ = 0.02 is used by Beneken and DeWit (1967). The factor Q = φ for
nonactivated muscle and Q = (1 + φ) for fully activated muscle is called the activation factor.
The activation factor does not change abruptly between extremes but rises slowly and falls
even more slowly. Various inotropic interventions are modeled by increasing the maximum
value of Q.
To account for the effect of shortening velocity on force developed by the shortening
muscle, Hill's equation is used (see Figure 5.2.12):
v = b(Fmax – F)/(F + a)

and the previous equations and figures, Beneken and DeWit (1967) described ventricular
behavior.
The Atria. Beneken and DeWit (1967) proposed a very rough approximation to atrial
mechanics. Rather than include heart muscle properties and atrial shape, they included only
information essential to proper model operation of the ventricles: introduction of ventricular
end-diastolic volume and pressure increase of the proper amplitude, at the appropriate time in
the cardiac cycle. They proposed equations to apply to the left and right atria:

pLA =

VRA − VRA (0)

Heart Rate Control. Beneken and DeWit (1967) incorporated a very simple concept of
heart rate control into their model. Figure 3.5.7 is a schematic of this concept. The transfer
relation between baroreceptor input (see Equation 3.3.2) and heart rate is assumed to occur
through two modes. In the first mode, the baroreceptor pressure input ℘ must be larger than
some threshold value ℘th, resulting in relatively large and fast responses, predominantly of
vagal origin. The transfer relation is a first-order equation with smaller time constant τ+ for
increasing pressures than for decreasing pressures τ–. The second mode results in relatively
small and slow responses caused by joint action of sympathetic and vagus nerves. The transfer
relation is a second-order linear equation.
This concept of heart rate control is simplified because it is derived from observations on
anesthetized animals. It does not account for the apparent action maintaining arterial mean
pressure at a reference set point of 12 kN/m2 (Talbot and Gessner, 1973). This set point shifts
during exercise so that mean central pressure rises higher than normal. Other neural
connections (e.g., between hypothalamus and medullary vasomotor area, between motor
cortex and vasomotor area, and between the respiratory control center and vasomotor area)
and weightings (between sympathetic and parasympathetic afferents) are not included.
The relation between baroreceptor output and pressure input is
℘=

pa s + pa d

(

)

+ φ pa s − pa d − p t h ,

p > pth

(3.5.30)

where ℘ = baroreceptor pressure function, N/m2
pas = systolic arterial blood pressure N/m2
pad = diastolic arterial blood pressure, N/m2
pth = threshold pressure, N/m2
φ = weighting factor, dimensionless

Figure 3.5.7 Two-region control of heart period incorporated in the Beneken and DeWit model. The
input is from the carotid sinus baroreceptors and the output is proportional to heart rate. Two control
pathways are assumed, one through the vagus (parasympathetic) nerve and the other through sympathetic
and vagal action. The period of a heartbeat is the sum of the two actions caused by the two modes. (Used
with permission from Beneken and DeWit, 1967.)

Systolic and diastolic pressures at the carotid sinus have been assumed to equal those at the
aortic arch. Moreover, by including the pulse pressure, (pas – pad), the differentiating effect of
the baroreceptors is included.
The action of the first mode is

Table 3.5.2 gives numerical values used by Beneken and DeWit (1967).
It has been found that contractile strength of heart muscle increases as heart rate increases
following an initial decline in contractility with heart rate increase (Beneken and DeWit,
1967). Furthermore, the negative inotropic effect of vagal impulses appears to be indirectly
due to heart rate reduction. Therefore, as heart rate increases, there is an initial decline
followed by a sustained increase in the forcefulness of blood ejection.
The activation factor Q introduced in Equations 3.5.16 and 3.5.19 is a time-varying
fraction of the actual muscular force to the maximum isometric force which can be developed
by the muscle. Beneken and DeWit (1967) incorporated the inotropic change in muscular

Coronary Blood Flow and Heart Performance. Adequate nutritional supply to the heart
muscle is required for maintenance of contractile properties. Normally, adequate blood flow is
maintained by autoregulatory mechanisms. This mechanism will fail at extremely low aortic
pressure. Beneken and DeWit (1967) assumed total metabolic deficit of the heart muscle
(which occurs when muscular energy requirements exceed energy delivered to the muscle by
the blood) to be dependent on the decrease of aortic pressure below 8000 N/m2, with the
deficit accumulating with time:

Mc = ∫ (8000 − pao ) d t

(3.5.36)

where Mc = metabolic factor, N·sec/m2
pao = aortic pressure, N/m2
t = time, sec
The activation factor Q is multiplied by Mc in the following manner:
Q' = Q (1 – 7.50 x 10-8 Mc)

(3.5.37)

where Q' = new value of the activation factor, dimensionless
Beneken and DeWit (1967) also included a measure of cardiac damage and irreversibility, but
this is not included here.
3.5.2

Systemic and Pulmonary Vessels

Mechanics. The vessels included are shown in Figure 3.5.1 and listed in Table 3.5.4. Gravitational effects are considered negligible. Pulmonary vessels are considered to be relatively
short and are subdivided into arterial and venous segments only; systemic vessels will include
capillaries as well. Acceleration of blood is much lower in the veins than in the arteries;
consequently, venous inertial effects are neglected. Furthermore, blood volume changes in the
veins are much lower than in the arteries during each cardiac cycle; therefore, venous viscous
wall effects are ignored. Conceptual models of arteries and veins are seen in Figure 3.5.8.
For each segment, relations have been developed for volume, flow, and pressure. These
are, for each arterial segment,

∆pj = R j VDi j + I j

dVDi j

where ∆pj = pressure difference between entrance and outlet of segment j, N/m2

Figure 3.5.8 Schematic models of an arterial segment and a venous segment. Rb and Ib represent viscous
and inertial properties of blood, Ca and R′a represent elastic and viscous properties of an arterial segment
wall, and Cv and R′v represent the resistance to flow and compliance of a venous segment. Pressures are
denoted by P and flows by VD . (Used with permission from Beneken and DeWit, 1967.)

where Cj = compliance of arterial segment j, m5/N
R'j = resistance to movement of arterial wall tissue, N·sec/m5
Referring to Figure 3.5.8, Rb and Ib are determined by vascular dimensions, blood viscosity,
and blood density. Ca, Cv, R′a, and R′v are related to vascular dimensions and mechanical
properties of the wall. Compliance values have been determined in such a way that elastic
tapering of the arterial tree is taken into account. Beneken and DeWit (1967), on the basis of
published evidence, estimated the time constant R′aCa for all systemic arterial segments to be
0.04 sec. Venous resistances have been calculated from pressure differences between adjacent
venous segments. Coronary capillary resistance, although influenced by the contractile action
of the heart, is assumed to be constant.
All vessel pressures are transmural; since vessels in the thoracic and abdominal cavities
are subject to variations in outer pressure due to such things as respiration, these have been
included for those segments that represent vessels in these cavities. Intrathoracic pressure is
assumed to be constant at –553 N/m2 (–4 mm Hg) and intra-abdominal pressure to be
+ 553 N/m2 (4 mm Hg) with respect to atmospheric pressure. Numerical values of pertinent
parameters appear in Tables 3.5.2 and 3.5.3.
Vascular Resistance Control. Beneken and DeWit (1967) included central nervous
system control of vascular resistance but ignored autoregulation. For simplicity, they assumed
all arteriovenous resistances change proportionately with the exception of coronary, head, and
arm resistances, which are assumed to be unaffected by vasoconstrictor and vasodilator action.
This proportionality would need to be changed to simulate exercise responses because blood
flow distribution is different during exercise and at rest (Table 3.2.3).
Beneken and DeWit assumed a vascular resistance control function of

τv = vascular time constant, sec
Values of RN can be found in Table 3.5.5. The time constant τv is taken as 12 sec. A change in
p to one-half normal yields an eventual resistance change of four-thirds normal.

Control of Capillary Pressure and Blood Volume. Capillary pressures directly
influence the net flow or fluid between blood and cellular spaces. These pressures are the
result of the difference between mean arteriole pressure and mean venule pressure. Both are
regulated by the central nervous system as well as by local autoregulatory mechanisms.
Beneken and DeWit (1967) assumed arteriole and venule resistances to change
proportionally and in a manner governed by Equation 3.5.42. Normal artery pressure is
assumed to be 13,300 N/m2 (100 mm Hg) and peripheral venous pressure is 800 N/m2
(6 mm Hg). Then capillary pressure becomes

pc

=

( pc − pv ) pa + ( pa − pc ) pv

(3.5.43a)

pa − pv
= 0.20pa + 0.80pv

pv = normal venous pressure, N/m2
Capillary pressure pc becomes 3300 N/m2 (25 mm Hg) when normal values of 13,300 N/m2
and 800 N/m2 are used for arterial and venous pressures.
Net fluid flow through capillary walls occurs when capillary pressure deviates from
3300 N/m2. Beneken and DeWit used the following relationship:
p − 3300
VDcw = c
Rcw

(3.5.44)

where VDcw = net flow through capillary walls, m3/sec
Rcw = resistance of capillary walls to fluid flow, N·sec/m5
A value of 26.7 x 109 (200 mm Hg·sec/mL) is used for Rcw.
Blood pooling that occurs in the veins has also been taken into account (Table 3.5.6). A
transient change in the pressure-volume relation of a vein vessel (Equation 3.5.41) occurs
after an increase in blood volume. This can be formulated in several ways, but Beneken and
DeWit chose to change the normal vessel volume Vj(0) summed over all vessels:

(

VTOT(t) = VTOT(0) + ∆VTOT(t) 1 − e −t / τ s

)

(3.5.45)

where VTOT(t) = total circulatory vessel volume as a function of time, m3
= ∑Vj(0)
VTOT(0) = initial total circulatory vessel volume m3
∆VTOT = total blood volume change caused by hemorrhage or infusion, m3
τs = time constant of stress relaxation in the veins, sec
Nonlinear Resistances. Highly nonlinear vascular resistances occur at the heart valves,
venous valves, when veins collapse, and in the pulmonary vasculature. Heart relations were
already given in Equations 3.5.6 and 3.5.7 and Equations 3.5.9 and 3.5.10. Venous valve
action can be included in the model with a diode, or check-valve relation:

VD j = 0

where

poj > pij
3
D
V j = flow through vein segment j, m /sec
poj = output pressure from vein segment j, N/m2
pij = input pressure to vein segment, j, N/m2

(3.5.46)

Venous valve action was incorporated in the model at the junction of the leg veins and
abdominal veins and at the junction of the superior vena cava and arm veins (but not head
veins, which carry twice the blood flow as the total to both arms).
Vessel collapse occurs whenever vessel transmural pressure becomes negative (see Section 4.2.3 for a similar situation for respiratory exhalation). When intraluminal pressure falls,
distensible walls contract. Flow velocity must increase if the same volume rate of flow is to be
maintained through the reduced cross-sectional area. When velocity increases, kinetic energy
increases, and potential energy of the fluid must consequently fall. When potential energy
falls, fluid static pressure falls, and the vessel walls collapse still further. This has the effect,
after a while, of decreasing flow velocity, and this whole scenario occurs in reverse. As a
result, vessel resistance to blood flow becomes very high and outflow pressure has little effect
on flow velocity.
Vessel collapse can occur when vessel transmural pressure becomes negative (with
respect to the vessel interior). The inferior vena cava commonly collapses when it passes
through the diaphragm and enters the thoracic cavity because intra-abdominal pressure is
positive and mean right atrial pressure is zero. Beneken and DeWit (1967) included this

collapse. For the model segments between the intestinal arteries and the inferior vena cava and
between the abdominal veins joining the inferior vena cava,

Model Performance

Beneken and DeWit (1967) tested their model to compare qualitative trends and quantitative
results with experimental findings reported in the literature. These results are summarized
here.
They first tested the mechanical model of the ventricles, atria, and circulation without
control of heart rate, peripheral resistance, capillary pressure, and blood volume. Even without
these control refinements, they found the model to maintain a homeostasis, albeit one with
wide tolerances. As peripheral resistance increased by 100%, cardiac output tended to fall, but
only about 20%. Individual increases in peripheral resistance, pulmonary resistance, activation
factor, systemic venous compliance, and heart rate all gave cardiac output changes of no more
than 25% of the normal value, with a direct summation of these contributions appearing to be
61% (Table 3.5.7). However, when all changes were made simultaneously, a 110% change
was seen. This illustrates the compensatory action of some of the responses to singleparameter variations.
Increasing the activation factor Q was found to result in an increase of ventricular
pressure, a reduction of the time to reach peak pressure, and an increase in the rate of pressure
rise.
When the aforementioned control parameters were added to the model, model
reproduction of experimental circulatory response to specialized cardiovascular maneuvers
and to hemorrhage was rather good. Beneken and DeWit found, for instance, that heart rate
responded realistically when neural information from aortic and carotid sinus pressures was
made to control effectors with equal weighting.
Although Beneken's model does appear to be able to predict rather well several cardiovascular responses, Talbot and Gessner (1973) questioned whether the model is sufficiently

complex to study exercise reactions. The model does not include peripheral resistance reaction
to local concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other metabolic products. In moderate
exercise, blood flow to active muscles and myocardium increases, whereas splanchnic and
renal flow may decrease, as does blood flow to the skin (until an increase in body temperature
causes cutaneous vasodilation; see Sections 5.3.3, 5.3.6, and 5.4.2). Cerebral blood flow
remains constant unless vigorous ventilation causes a fall in carbon dioxide concentration (in
which case cerebral vessels vasoconstrict; see Section 3.3.1). Central blood pressure is higher
than normal in exercise, allowing higher blood flows to muscle and skin than permitted by
local vasodilation alone. To account for these changes would require a more complex model
including local metabolic rates and local metabolite effects.
APPENDIX 3.1
NUMERICALLY SOLVING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Differential equations appearing in various bioengineering models can be solved on a digital
computer using numerical approximations to these equations. Finite difference techniques are
often used to convert differential equations into finite difference equations.
1. APPROXIMATIONS TO DERIVATIVES

A derivative such as dV/dt can be estimated at point 1 by means of the approximation

dV ∆V V2 − V1
,
≈
=
d t ∆t t 2 − t1

t2 > t1

(A3.1.1)

where V2 is the value of V corresponding to t = t2. The difficulty with this approximation is
that the point of interest is on the boundary of the approximation. If the point where the
derivative is to be determined is point 1, then the finite difference in Equation A3.1.1 is the
forward difference. If the point in question is point 2, then Equation A3.1.1 gives a backward
difference. A central difference sometimes gives a better approximation:

∆V V2 − V0
,
=
∆t t 2 − t 0

(t2 > t1 > t0)

(A3.1.2)

Because information about past values of V seldom is available at the beginning of a


150

numerical solution, the forward difference approximation must be used for the initial
difference. Central differences can be used thereafter.
Second derivatives can be determined from either

t2 − t0

(A3.1.4)

t2 − t0

The second method is preferable to the first because numerically approximating a derivative tends
to emphasize noise appearing in the data. If V2 ≈ V1 then (V2 - Vj) will be a difference of two nearly
equal numbers. The difference will be nearly zero, and round-off error, truncation error,
measurement noise, and the like, will constitute a large part of the difference. Because derivative
estimation emphasizes noise, taking the difference between two first-derivative estimates to form
the second derivative estimate, as in Equation A3.1.3, is not recommended.

Estimation of higher order derivatives can be made using coefficients from the binomial
expansion. For instance, the third derivative is given by

d 3V
dt

3

≈

V3 − 2V2 + 2V1 − V0
t3 − t 0

(A3.1.5)

2. INTEGRAL EQUATIONS

If derivative estimation emphasizes noise, then integration deemphasizes noise. This is
because numerical integration involves summation, and errors are likely to be positive
sometimes and negative at other times. In the sum, positive errors will cancel with negative
errors.
Numerical integration can be performed in a number of ways. Trapezoidal integration
gives

(t1 − t 0 )

t1

∫ V (t ) d t ≈ 2 (V + V )

(A3.1.9)

After d2V/dt2 is evaluated numerically, dV/dt can be formed by numerically integrating d2V/dt2,
and V can be formed by numerically integrating dV/dt. Thus all derivatives can be found in
order.
3. INITIAL VALUES

A common mistake made by students is to assume all derivatives to be initially zero. If this
were the case, then lower order derivatives would never become nonzero. Returning to
Equation A3.1.9, an initial estimate of d2V/dt2 can be made if f(0), (dV/dt)(0), and V(0) are
known or assumed. Let us assume that f(0) and f(1) are known. Initially we assume V(0) = Vo
= V1 and (dV/dt)(0) = dVo/dt. If, in addition, the parameters I, R, and C are not constant, then

dV1

(A3.1.11)

If I, R, and C are constant, Equation A3.1.11 simplifies considerably. Often enough, initial
values for V and dV/dt are taken to be zero, which will give a solution over time for V relative
to the starting value.
After initial values of f(t), dV/dt, and V are calculated, they can be substituted into the
system equations to obtain all values at all times. Changes in higher order derivatives always
precede changes in lower order derivatives.
4. TIME STEP

The time increment from one numerical evaluation to the next can be critical. With too large a
step, inaccuracy or even instability can result. With too small a step, the entire procedure can
take much longer than necessary and errors due to small differences can compound rapidly.
Entire chapters in numerical technique textbooks are dedicated to this topic. In general, the
more rapid the change expected in the results, the smaller the time increment must be. A
useful procedure is to increase the time step by 2 and compare results from the original time
increment to results from the new time step. If a difference is noted, then the increase
probably cannot be made. If no appreciable difference is noted, increase the time step by
another factor of 2 and repeat the procedure. No change in the results indicates that a larger
time step can be used.
Instability can usually be of two kinds: results oscillate between limits and don't seem to
settle down to one result, or results increase without bound. When either of these is
encountered, the time increment should be decreased.
APPENDIX 3.2
PONTRYAGIN MAXIMUM PRINCIPLE

The Pontryagin maximum principle is a necessary but not sufficient condition for optimality.
Beginning with the state equations for a system:


152

dxi
= f i ( x j ),
dt

i = 1, ,2, 3, ..., n
j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n

(A3.2.1)

find the control function u which causes the functional

x0 =

t

∫ f ( x ,u ) d t
j

0

t0

(A3.2.2)

to take its minimum possible value.
The Pontryagin method begins with the formation of a system of linear homogeneous
adjoint equations:
n

∂f j
dψ i
ψj
=−
dt
∂xi
j =0

∑

(A3.2.3)

and follows with a function H:
n

H=

∑ψ f ( x ,u)
j

j

i

(A3.2.4)

j =0

The optimal control function u is that which causes H to take its maximum possible value for
all times t. The optimal control function also causes x0 to be minimized at all times.
A simple example shows how this scheme is applied. Consider a system described by
dx1
= x 2 = f1
dt

(A3.2.5)

dx 2
=u = f2
dt

(A3.2.6)

with the constraint that |u| ≤ 1 (Barkelew, 1975). The problem is to minimize the time for the
system to reach x1 = x2 = 0 starting at any initial state x1(0), x2(0). Since the cost functional
involves the time to reach zero,
x0 =

t

∫ dt

(A3.2.7)

0

and the minimum x0 will give the desired condition for optimality.
Because f0 = 1 does not involve x1 or x2, and neither do f1 and f2, ψ0 is not considered.
From Equation A3.2.3:

∂f
∂f
dψ 1
= − 1 ψ1 − 2 ψ 2 = − 0 − 0 = 0
∂x1
∂x1
dt
∂f
∂f
dψ 2
= − 1 ψ 1 − 2 ψ 2 = −ψ 1 − 0 = −ψ1
∂x 2
∂x 2
dt
Integrating Equations A3.2.8 and A3.2.9 gives
ψ1 = C1

(A3.2.8)

(A.3.2.9)

(A3.2.10)


153

ψ2 = C2 – C1t

(A3.2.11)

H = C1x2 + (C2 – C1t)u

(A3.2.12)

Then
The maximum value for H occurs with u = 1 when (C2 – C1t) > 0 and u = -1 when (C2 – C1t) <
0. Since t increases monotonically from zero, u begins with a value of + 1 (assuming C1 and
C2 to be positive) and changes to - 1 for t > C1/C2 and then remains at - 1.
The constants C1 and C2 can be assigned values based on initial values and ending values
(ending values both zero) for x1 and x2. For nonlinear problems, determination of C1 and C2
values is not easy.
The example just given is a very simple one. For a more realistic biological model such
as
V
dV
d 2V
+R
+ I 2 =u
C
dt
dt

(A3.2.13)

with the objective to find u to minimize mean squared acceleration,
x0 =

t

∫ Vd t
0

(A3.2.14)

one proceeds to determine the first-order state equations by defining
x1 = V

(A3.2.15)

dV dx1
=
x2 = VD =
dt dt

(A3.2.16)

dx1
= x2
dt

(A3.2.17)

so that Equation A3.2.13 yields

dx 2 u x1 R
= −
− x2
(A3.2.18)
d t I IC I
From this point, finding the optimal H value proceeds in a fashion similar to the previous
example, but this is very much more complicated and in all likelihood would need to be
solved numerically.
The Pontryagin maximum principle attempts to find an optimal set of control values from
one point in space-time. If several sets of values give local optima, the nonsufficient nature of
the maximum principle does not allow the absolute optimum to be chosen from among the set
of local optima.
APPENDIX 3.3
THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Transforms are mathematical tools that ease the solution of constant coefficient differential
equations, integral equations, and convolution integrals. Laplace transforms are one type of
transform used to convert ordinary differential equations into algebraic equations. This eases
the work of solving these equations because algebraic operations are easily performed. The


154

general order of solution is (1) transform the equation into its algebraic form (often called
conversion into the s domain, so-called because of the Laplace transform operator symbolized
by s), (2) algebraically solve the transformed equation for the dependent variable, and (3)
reconvert the dependent variable into its time-equivalent function (often called conversion to
the time domain). Practically speaking, the first step is usually a simple replacement of sn for
dn/dtn and s-n for ∫n···∫(dt)n, and the last step can be aided by complete tables of inverse Laplace
transformations (see, for example, Barnes, 1975, or Wylie, 1966).
The Laplace transform for a real function f(t) which equals zero for t < 0 is
‹ [f(t)] =

∞

∫ e f (t ) d t = F (s)
− st

(A3.3.1)

0

where ‹ [f(t)] = F(s) = Laplace transform of f(t)
s = a complex (real + imaginary) parameter, dimensionless
and the inverse Laplace transformation is
1 a + i∞ st
e F ( s ) ds = f (t )
(A3.3.2)
2πi a − i∞
where a = a real constant chosen to exclude all singularities of F(s) to the left of the path of
integration
i = the imaginary indicator
This last integral is to be completed in the complex plane and may not always exist.
Fortunately, this integration need not often be carried out.
The Laplace transformation is a linear operation. This means that it obeys the rules of
association and distribution:
‹–1 [f(s)] =

∫

‹ [c f(t) + dg(t)] = c‹[f(t)] + d‹ [g(t)]
= cF(s) + dG(s)

(A3.3.3)

‹–1[cF(s) + dG(s)] = c‹–1[F(s)] + d‹–1[G(s)]
= c f(t) + dg(t)

(A3.3.4)

begin with a value zero. For instance, the system with a time-domain response of
where

+ R sV ( s) − V (0 + ) + I s 2V ( s) − sV (0 + ) − VD (0 + ) = G ( s )

(A3.3.7)


155

If we assume the system starts completely from rest,
V ( s)
+ RsV ( s) + Is 2V ( s) = G ( s)
C

(A3.3.8)

Solving for the dependent variable V(s),
V (s) =

G ( s)

(A3.3.9)

1/ C + Rs + I s 2

Thus far the forcing function G(s) has not been specified. If the forcing function g(t) is an
impulse, then G(s) = 1. If g(t) is a unit step (the input is 0 for t < 0 and 1 for t > 0), then G(s) =
s-1 If g(t) is a unit ramp [g(t) = t], then G(s) = s-2 One advantage of the Laplace transformation
is that g(t) need not be specified until inverse transformation is to occur, but essential
information about system operation can be deduced while still in the s domain.
To obtain the inverse transformation of Equation A3.3.9, the denominator is usually
factored into first-order terms:
G ( s)
V(s) =
(A3.3.10a)
I (s + A)( s + B )

A =

(A3.3.11)

where α and β = constants to be determined
In order that Equation A3.3.11 be an equality,

αG(s)[s + B] + βG(s)[I(s + A)] = G(s)

(A3.3.12)

(α + βI)s + (Bα + βIA) = 1

(A3.3.18)

the difference of two exponential terms.
With use, Laplace transforms will be found to be easy to apply to most constant
coefficient systems. Recognition that terms such as (s + A)-1 correspond to exponentials in the
time domain can come automatically. Furthermore, the frequency response of a system (i.e.,
the output magnitude and phase angle as input frequency is varied) can be simply obtained by
replacing s by iω, where i is the imaginary operator and ω the radial frequency. This is true
because the Laplace transform is a special case of the Fourier transform.
Unfortunately, many of the more realistic biological systems models are not entirely
linear and may not include constant coefficients. For those models Laplace transforms can be
used only for restricted conditions.
