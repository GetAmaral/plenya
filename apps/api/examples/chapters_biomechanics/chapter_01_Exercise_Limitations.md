INTRODUCTION

The study of exercise is important to the bioengineer. To understand exercise responses is to
understand physiological responses to natural stresses to which the body has become attuned.
This understanding can be used to facilitate communication with physiologists, veterinarians,
occupational hygienists, or medical personnel on multidisciplinary research, development, or
management teams. Familiarity with exercise physiology may be a requirement for the proper
design decisions when developing a new bioengineering product. Bioengineers, especially
those who have accumulated some experience and reputation in their field, are often requested
to evaluate research or management proposals or design reports from their subordinates. A
basic understanding of exercise physiology can be an invaluable aid toward making the proper
evaluation. Furthermore, there is something to be said for the individual who seeks knowledge
of the surrounding world for the sake of global understanding and self-actualization. This is
the type of individual who would relish the opportunity to study the material with which this
book is filled, and this is the type of individual who will see new ways to describe and
formulate physiological information.
Like many exercise physiology texts, this book must deal with a broad scope of material.
After all, exercise responses are both all-consuming and highly integrated: most physiological
systems, artificially divided and separately studied, become one total supportive mechanism
for the performance of the physical stress of exercise.
Unlike many exercise physiology texts, the emphasis here is on quantitative description
as much as possible. This means that the book is not intended to be a physiology primer;
others will have to be used for introductory purposes. This book is intended to demonstrate the
vast amount of physiological material that can be quantitatively predicted. For this reason,
some physiological facts are not included here, but the hope is that the equations, models, and
tables of numerical values will make up for any omission.
Models play an important part in the engineering world. As Grodins (1981) states:
[Models] ... clarify our thinking about a problem by explicitly identifying and clearly stating every
assumption and limitation and ... set the stage for a rigorous analysis usually expressed in
mathematical language.... They provide a compact, clear, rigorously integrated summary of current
conventional wisdom about how some natural system works.... Textbooks in the biological sciences
are often swollen with detailed verbal descriptions which do not depart very far from raw
1
This statement, known as Ockham's Razor, or the Principle of Parsimony, is the basis for selecting the simplest possible model
to describe a process.

experimental observations. Textbooks of physics, on the contrary, are compact because they contain
descriptions of models almost exclusively....
The archival function of models implies that they should also serve a valuable teaching function, as
indeed they do in the physical sciences. Dynamic respiratory models, especially in their
computerized interactive format, should be very valuable in teaching physiologists, medical students,
and physicians the essence of normal and pathological pulmonary physiology....
Finally, models provide a mechanism for rigorously exploring the observable implications of
physiological hypotheses and thus can help to design experiments to test them. Investigators must
know what a particular hypothesis commits them to in terms of experimental observations before
they can test it. In a complex system with many interacting variables which cannot be experimentally
isolated, rigorous modeling may be the only way to obtain them. Such predictions may sometimes
turn out to be unexpected and counterintuitive. If they survive an exhausting recheck of model
formulation and computation, this surprising behavior of models is one of their most valuable
attributes in hypothesis testing.2

This book emphasizes models, quantitative mathematical models if possible, or
conceptual models at the very least. Especially in the last three chapters, several models
describing cardiovascular, respiratory, or thermal responses are presented. The physiology
sections preceding the models are directed toward presentation of sufficient background to
understand the models. First, there are some basic concepts concerning exercise in general
that must be introduced and kept in mind in succeeding chapters. These concepts deal with
exercise duration and limitations to perpetual performance.
1.2

EXERCISE INTENSITY AND DURATION

Generally, intense exercise can be performed for short times only. The intensity-duration
curve for any particular individual plots generally as a hyperbola asymptotically approaching
each axis (Figure 1.2.1). Although Figure 1.2.1 was used to describe exercise limitations
imposed by respiratory protective masks, the general shape is still valid for exercise of various
intensities; it shows that for very high rates of work, very short performance times can be
expected.
In an interesting summary article, Riegel (1981) compared world-class athletic
performance records for running, race walking, cross-country skiing, roller and speed skating,
cycling, freestyle swimming, and manpowered flight. He plotted time against distance on
logarithmic scales and found a linear relationship between the times of 210 and 13,800 sec
(Figure 1.2.2). Below 180-240 sec, athletic competition includes sprints and other activity
involving transient body processes. Above 13,800 sec, competition is rarely, if ever, carried to
the limit of endurance. Thus over the linear range of 210-13,800 sec (3.5-230 min),
performance time is predicted by the following equation:
t = axb
where

(1.2.1)

t = endurance time, sec
a = constant, sec/kmb
x = distance, km
b = fatigue factor, dimensionless

The constant a is dependent on the units of measurement and has no particular significance.
The exponent b determines the rate at which average speed decreases with distance. Values

Cobelli et al. (1984) state that "the principal difficulty attached to the mathematical analysis of physiological and medical
systems stems from the mismatch between the complexity of the processes in question and the limited data available from such
systems."

for these constants, obtained by a least-squares3 analysis, are found in Table 1.2.1. Worldclass runners, men and women, have an identical fatigue factor of 1.08; men and women
swimmers share a fatigue factor of 1.03.

Manipulating the endurance equation gives, for average speed,

(1.2.2)

where s = speed, km/sec
These speeds, seen in Figure 1.2.3, are instructive for characterizing individual sports. In
cycling, aerodynamic drag is the dominant form of resistance, and cyclists often line up one
behind the other, with the lead cyclist breaking the wind for the rest. Speed skaters also
operate at high speeds, with their inherent drag, and must also negotiate many turns. Runners
are affected by the large forces they must develop or absorb as they overcome the inertia from
rapid limb movement. Their bodily centers of gravity rise and fall with each step. Race
walkers are not jolted with each step, as runners are, but their body motions must be more
contorted and require great stretching effort and use of more of their total musculature.
Swimmers compete in a medium that is relatively viscous, which limits their speeds
considerably.
Men and women swim and run at the same distances in world-class events. In swimming,
women attain speeds of about 94% of those of a man. In running, women achieve about 88%
of the speed of men.

When comparing running records, age can be seen to decrease average attainable speed
(Figure 1.2.4). A septuagenarian can run 70% as fast as a world-class man. The difference
with age appears to be greater for the shorter running distances than it does for longer
distances. At longer distances, the speed of the fastest 40-year-old is nearly the same as that of
a world-class man. It is unclear how much of this is due to relative short-term endurance loss
or due to different training or competitive factors with older men. Certainly, older men who
hold other jobs cannot spend full time training, nor are they subject to the highest acclaim
when winning a race.
Returning to Figure 1.2.1, there are several dashed-line hyperbolas that appear in the plot.
This figure suggests that several factors can limit exercise performance. Those shown to be
important while exercising wearing a mask are cardiovascular, respiratory, thermal, and longterm effects. Although each of these can contribute to the exercise performance limitation, it is
the factor determining shortest time at any particular steady work rate which is the limiting
factor in exercise performance. The overall work rate performance time characteristic is the
locus of points formed from the individual stress limitations. Approximate time and work rate
data have been obtained from published reports, and supporting experimental data appear in
Table 1.2.2.
The conceptual framework appearing in Figure 1.2.1 is relative only. Normal individuals
not wearing masks probably will not experience a respiratory limitation to exercise.
Imposition of heavy clothing may move the thermal stress limitation curve to the left from its
position in Figure 1.2.1 such that it dominates the whole figure.
The implications of this hypothetical intensity-duration concept are many. First the
model implies that the various types of stress can be studied independently from one another
at appropriate levels of work. Second, any interactions between stress, if they occur, would be
found at work rates and performance times where two component stress limitation curves

Figure 1.2.5 Differences in rectal temperature of cats with carotid bodies intact when breathing air and

intersect on the overall work limitation curve. Thus a cardiovascular-respiratory interaction
and a respiratory-thermal interaction could be found, but no cardiovascular-thermal
interaction would be expected as long as the respiratory limitation was interposed between
them.
There is limited evidence to suggest a respiratory-thermal interaction. Johnson and Berlin
(1973) present very tenuous and indirect evidence of this interaction. Jennings and Szlyk
(1986) gave a stronger physiological basis to the interaction by demonstrating that the carotid
bodies, important in respiratory control (see Section 4.3. 1), can also affect temperature
regulation (Figure 1.2.5). In their animals they showed that hypoxic stimulation of the carotid
bodies suppresses shivering.
Body temperature has been found to have a direct effect on heart rate (Rubin, 1987), and,
therefore, a thermal-cardiac interaction might also be expected in some humans. The
implications of this intensity-duration concept cannot be drawn too far.
1.3

MUSCLE METABOLISM

Although the previous section suggests many possible limitations to exercise performance, the
most widely considered limitation involves the basic energy mechanisms of the muscles
themselves. For exercise durations of 0-900 sec (0- 15 min), these mechanisms most surely
dominate exercise capacity.
1.3.1

Muscle Fiber Structure

Individual muscle fibers have been found to be composed of fibrils (about 1 µm in diameter),
which are themselves composed of the protein filaments actin and myosin (White et al.,


EXERCISE INTENSITY AND DURATION

8

Figure 1.3.1 Relationships between actin and myosin filaments in three muscle conditions. (Redrawn
with permission from White et al., 1959.)

1959). These filaments are crosslinked, either directly or indirectly, by chemical bonds
(Figure 1.3.1).4 When muscle contraction occurs, these bonds must be broken and other bonds,
which slide the actin filaments along the myosin filaments, must be established. Such a
process requires a source of energy which is immediate and can deliver energy over a
considerable amount of time.
The force per unit area (also called tension) that a muscle develops varies with the length
of the muscle fiber. Tension developed can be measured either during an isometric (or
constant-length) contraction or on an unstimulated, passive muscle fiber. Length of the muscle
fiber is usually related to resting length. The length-tension relationship between muscles,
which affects their efficiencies, is discussed in detail in Section 5.2.5.
Two types of muscle fibers, slow twitch and fast twitch, have been identified. Fast-twitch
fibers are primarily those concerned with fine, rapid, precise movement. Slow-twitch fibers
are involved in strong, gross, sustained movements (Ganong, 1963). Fast-twitch fibers appear
to be more adapted for anaerobic contraction, whereas slow-twitch fibers utilize oxygen better
(Kamon, 1981). Therefore, a higher proportion of slow-twitch fibers in a given muscle mass
should provide a better aerobic endurance of the muscle.
1.3.2

Muscle Energy Sources

Organic phosphate compounds are the fundamental energy sources for muscle cells. Of
particular importance is adenosine triphosphate (ATP).5 ATP can be hydrolyzed by
actomyosin, which affects its physical state. When ATP is hydrolyzed, it forms phosphate
4
The muscle can lock (establish stable crosslinking) at any point between 65 and 120% of the resting length (White et al., 1959).
A study of mechanisms involved in the process is given by Davis (1986).
5
Adenosine is an organic nucleic acid adenine linked to ribose (White et al., 1959). When one ring hydroxide is replaced with
three phosphate groups (phosphorus and oxygen), the result is adenosme triphosphate. There are two high-energy
pyrophosphate bonds in ATP.

plus free energy plus adenosine diphosphate (ADP). ADP contains one energy-rich bond and
can also be used as a muscle energy source. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), the final
product of ATP and ADP hydrolysis, contains no usable energy for muscular contraction.
There are severe restrictions on AMP as a phosphate acceptor; it cannot accept phosphate
either from anaerobic glycolysis or from oxidative reactions, which may be one reason why
ATP is almost immediately formed from ADP whenever possible.
ATP is used as the energy-rich carrier not only for muscular contraction but also for
resting metabolic processes, such as protein formation and osmotic maintenance. For these,
there is ample store of ATP within the muscle. ATP formation occurs continually by the
oxidation of carbohydrate or acetoacetate (White et al., 1959).
Maximally contracting mammalian muscle uses approximately 1.7 x 10-5 mole of ATP
per gram per second (White et al., 1959). However, ATP stores in skeletal muscle tissue
amount to 5 x 10-6 mole per gram of tissue, which can meet muscle demands for no more than
1/2 sec of intense activity.
Initial replenishment of ATP occurs through the transfer of creatine phosphate (also
called phosphagen) into creatine, a reaction which is catalyzed by creatine kinase (White et
al., 1959). In the resting state, muscle contains four to six times as much creatine phosphate as
it does ATP. Phosphocreatine, however, cannot directly affect actomyosin.
Even considering phosphocreatine, the total supply of high-energy phosphate cannot
sustain activity for more than a few seconds. Glycogen is a polysaccharide present in muscle
tissue in large amounts.6 When required, glycogen is decomposed into glucose and pyruvic
acid. This pyruvic acid, in turn, becomes lactic acid. ATP is formed in this process. All these
reactions proceed without oxygen. During intense muscle activity, the oxygen content of
blood flowing through muscle tissue can be rapidly depleted (anaerobic conditions).
When sufficient oxygen is available (aerobic conditions), either in muscle tissue or
elsewhere, these process are reversed. ATP is reformed from ADP and AMP, creatine
phosphate is reformed from creatine and phosphate, and glycogen is reformed from glucose or
lactic acid. Energy for these processes is derived from the complete oxidation of
carbohydrates, fatty acids, or amino acids to form carbon dioxide and water (Molé, 1983).
Following the manner of Astrand and Rodahl (1970), the foregoing reactions can be
summarized by chemical equations:

Anaerobic:
ATP⇔ADP + P + free energy

(1.3.1)

creatine phosphate + ADP⇔creatine + ATP

(1.3.2)

glycogen or glucose + P + ADP→ lactate + ATP

(1.3.3)

glycogen or fatty acids + P + ADP + O2→ CO2 + H,O + ATP

(1.3.4)

2ADP⇔ATP + AMP

(1.3.5)

Aerobic:

All conditions:

Anaerobic and aerobic processes can occur simultaneously in different parts of the body.
Lactic acid freely diffuses from muscle cells into interstitial fluid and thence to the blood,

Glycogen has been likened to animal starch. If the amount of energy equivalent to glycogen were present in the form of the
simple sugar glucose, the osmotic balance of muscle tissue would be gravely upset.

where it is carried to the liver. Most of the lactic acid7 is resynthesized to glycogen in the liver,
at the expense of liver ATP. Liver glycogen is released as blood glucose8 for utilization by
muscle.
If muscular work is at a pace slow enough for sufficient oxygen delivery for aerobic
measures to prevail, then the glucose is directly utilized in muscle to generate ATP. If oxygen
is not available, then anaerobic processes yield sufficient ATP for muscular action. Because
there is a limit to the amount of anaerobic metabolites that can be tolerated by muscle tissue,
there is also a limit to the duration of anaerobic metabolism. Oxygen is required to chemically
remove these metabolites from the tissue. The greater the concentration of metabolites, the
greater is the amount of oxygen required to reform resting levels of glycogen and
phosphocreatine.9 This, in turn, leads to the concept of oxygen debt.
1.3.3

Oxygen Debt

At the cessation of exercise there remains an elevated need for oxygen (Figure 1.3.2). The
amount of oxygen utilized after exercise, above normal resting levels, is termed the oxygen
debt. As we have discussed, much of this oxygen debt is accumulated by muscle
biochemistry. However, there are other contributing factors to oxygen debt: (1) elevated body
temperature immediately following exercise increases bodily metabolism in general, which
requires more than resting levels of oxygen to service; (2) increased blood epinephrine levels
increase general bodily metabolism; (3) increased respiratory and cardiac muscle activity
requires oxygen (4) refilling of body oxygen stores requires excess oxygen; and (5) there is
some thermal inefficiency in replenishing muscle chemical stores. Considering only lactic
acid oxygen debt, the total amount of oxygen required to return the body to its normal resting
state is about double. Viewed the other way, the efficiency of anaerobic processes is about
50% of aerobic processes (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970).

Figure 1.3.2 Oxygen uptake at the beginning of exercise increases gradually until reaching a level high
enough to meet demands of the tissues. At the end of exercise, oxygen uptake gradually returns to the
resting level as the oxygen debt is filled. (Adapted and redrawn with permission from Astrand and
Rodahl, 1970.)
7
Plasma lactate may play a part in the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and other hormones associated with
mobilization reactions of bodily systems to exercise (Farrell et al., 1983).
8
There is a very intricate regulation of blood glucose, the complete description of which is outside the purview of this book.
Basically, glucose input depends mostly on ingested carbohydrate, which in turn is dependent on hypothalamic and thyroid
function. Insulin acts to remove glucose from the blood and produce liver glycogen. Epinephrine and glucagon decrease liver
glycogen and increase blood glucose (White et al., 1959).
9
Also reformed is oxymyoglobin. Muscle tissue contains a protein similar to blood hemoglobin, which also binds to, and stores,
oxygen. The major difference between myoglobin and hemoglobin is that the former stores one oxygen atom, whereas the latter
stores four oxygen atoms for every hemoglobin molecule in the oxidated state.

This muscular cycle is reflected in the amount of heat generated by the muscles. There is
a small amount of resting heat produced by the muscles reflecting basic muscle metabolism;
there is an initial heat produced during muscle contraction and relaxation; and there is a heat
of recovery during the restoration of the muscle to its preactivated state. Heat of recovery is
nearly equal to initial muscle energy expenditure (Mende and Cuervo, 1976).
That muscular activity results in heat as well as useful mechanical work means that
muscles are less than 100% efficient. In fact, the large muscles are about 20-30% efficient,
about the same as a gasoline engine (Morehouse and Miller, 1967). Efficiency is diminished
by excessive loads, excessive rate of work, and fatigue (see Chapter 5).
During heavy work there is a discrepancy between muscular energy demand and aerobic
energy available. In Figure 1.3.3 can be seen the relative energy contributions of aerobic fuel
utilization and the two anaerobic contributions of anaerobic glycolysis and phosphocreatine
utilization. Similar information is available from Table 1.3.1 and Figure 1.3.4. As the level of
work decreases, such that performance time increases, the relative contribution of aerobic
energy provision increases.
The more a person must rely on anaerobic processes to perform any given task, the
greater will be that person's oxygen debt. From Table 1.3. 1, an athlete competing in a 60-120
sec (1-2 min) event requires about 167 kN·m (40 kcal) to be repaid as a lactic acid oxygen
debt. For each cubic meter (1000 L) of oxygen used, about 20,900 kN·m (5000 kcal) will be
delivered, resulting in a lactic acid oxygen debt of 0.008 m3 (8 L). Reformation of ATP and
creatine phosphate requires about 0.001-0.0015 extra cubic meters of oxygen (total thus far of
0.0095 m3). Assuming the basic efficiency of oxygen repayment is about 50%, an increase in
oxygen uptake of about 0.0019-0.0020m3 follows the exercise.10
With performance times up to 120 sec, anaerobic power dominates aerobic power. At
about 120 sec, each is of equal importance. With longer performance time, aerobic power
prevails (Figure 1.3.4). Therefore, at performance times below about 120 sec exercise is

Blood lactate levels decline more rapidly while exercising during the recovery period than while resting (Stamford et al,
1981).

Based on the following assumptions: (1) 20.9 kN·m energy is equivalent to oxygen uptake of 0.001 m3;
(2) an individual's maximal aerobic capacity is 188 kN·m; (3) 100% of maximal oxygen uptake can be
maintained during 600 sec, 95% during 1800 sec, 85% during 3600 sec, and 80% during 7200 sec.

decrement is more likely to be from systemic causes which interfere with oxygen transport.

flow), and for a performance time exceeding about 180 sec (so that oxygen can reach steady
state before the cessation of exercise), there will be found a rate of oxygen delivery to the
muscles which cannot be exceeded. This value is termed the maximal oxygen uptake, or
maximal aerobic power for the individual. Maximal oxygen uptake appears at a relatively high
work rate (250 N·m/sec in Figure 1.3.5), but not necessarily at the highest attainable work
rate, the highest work rate that can be performed for at least 180 sec. Although the rate of
work can be increased, the rate at which oxygen is delivered to and used by the body cannot
be increased. There is a significant and fast-rising increase in blood lactic acid, indicating that
anaerobic metabolism has already begun (Figure 1.3.6).
Below the maximal oxygen uptake, the rate of oxygen use is directly proportional to the
rate of work (Figure 1.3.6). The actual rate of oxygen use will depend on the muscle groups
used and their relative efficiencies. When maximal oxygen uptake is reached, it too depends
on the muscles used and the way in which they are used (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). As long
as exercise is performed in an upright position, and with the legs or arms and legs together,
there is no appreciable difference in oxygen uptake (Table 1.3.2) for different kinds of
exercise (running, cycling, cross-country skiing, etc.). While supine, however, legs-only
exercise gives a maximal oxygen uptake of about 85% of upright maximal oxygen uptake, and
swimming (arms plus legs) yields 90%).
The exact mechanism limiting oxygen uptake has been the subject of controversy.
Faulkner et al. (1971) suggest that the limiting mechanism is the rate at which blood can be
pumped by the heart. With a higher capacity, more oxygen could be delivered to the muscles.

Maximal oxygen uptakes of about 4.2 x 10-5 m3 O2/sec (2.5 L/min) are typical for young
(20-30 years of age) male nonathletes (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). This figure becomes 6.1 x
10-7 m3 O2/kg·sec for a typical 68 kg man. Well-trained male athletes possess maximal oxygen
uptakes twice as high as this, and untrained women have maximum oxygen uptakes 70% as
large. There is a rapid increase in maximum oxygen uptake before the age of 20, with no
significant sex difference before the age of 12, and a gradual, nearly linear decline with age
after 20, reaching about 70% of the age 20 value at age 65.11 There is a large individual

variation, which limits application of these values to particular people. Modern training
methods, especially for women, have dramatically altered their relative maximum oxygen
uptakes. Active older individuals are likely to possess higher maximum oxygen uptakes than
sedentary younger individuals. Since capacity for work depends directly on maximum oxygen
uptake, there is a great influence of training on work capacity.
Training increases maximum oxygen uptake and also increases maximum oxygen debt.
Muscle metabolism becomes more efficient, and muscle stores of ATP, creatine phosphate,
and glycogen increase (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Muscle basal metabolism (see Chapter 5)
decreases, indicating increased metabolic efficiency (Morehouse and Miller, 1967). Muscle
mass increases, the capillary density increases, and myoglobin content increases (Astrand and
Rodahl, 1970; Morehouse and Miller, 1967). Heart volume increases dramatically, to the point
where it would be considered unhealthy for an untrained individual (see Chapter 3). At the
same time, heart rate decreases and blood volume increases. Beyond that, movement
efficiency increases due to a learning effect.
Kamon (1981) presented an equation from which can be obtained a relationship between
endurance time and the relative work rate, given as a fraction of an individual's maximum
oxygen uptake:

Anaerobic Threshold

The onset of progressive lactic acid accumulation with graded exercise is called the anaerobic
threshold (Wasserman et al., 1973). The anaerobic threshold is a benchmark in exercise
physiology. Below it, one set of physiological assumptions appears to hold; above it,
physiological adjustments are much less simple. The anaerobic threshold occurs at workloads
between 50 and 80% of maximal oxygen uptake. Anaerobic threshold for athletes is higher
than it is for inactive individuals.
Measured anaerobic threshold has been defined in different ways by different workers. It
can be indicated by a threshold level of lactate in the blood (Farrell et al., 1979), increased
output of carbon dioxide from the lungs (Sutton and Jones, 1979, Chapter 4), increased rate of
respiratory ventilation (linear with work rate below the anaerobic threshold) above the
predicted linear value (Davis et al., 1976; Wasserman et al., 1973, Figure 4), an increase in
respiratory exchange ratio (rate of carbon dioxide produced divided by rate of oxygen used)
above its resting level (Issekutz et al., 1967; Naimark et al., 1964) and various end-tidal gas
partial pressure measures (Davis et al., 1976; Martin and Weil, 1979; Wasserman et al., 1973).
However, none of these definitions is quite satisfactory; they all suffer from shortcomings of
one kind or another. Blood lactate accumulation as a definition suffers from the presence of
concurrent lactate removal; therefore, by this definition anaerobic threshold does not
accurately reflect the onset of anaerobic metabolism. Rate of exhaled carbon dioxide as a
definition suffers from its indirectness and the influence of respiratory anatomical,
mechanical, and control factors on carbon dioxide excretion (see Chapter 4). Although


16

EXERCISE LIMITATION

ventilation increases above that predicted linearly from work rate, because of the increased
acidity of the blood above the anaerobic threshold, this definition is still very indirect and also
suffers from the difficulty in estimating just when the relationship of ventilation with work
rate becomes nonlinear.12 Carbon dioxide is excreted at a higher rate above anaerobic
threshold than below; thus respiratory exchange ratio should give some information about the
threshold, but Wasserman et al. (1973) found the exchange ratio to be among the most
insensitive to accurate anaerobic threshold prediction. The various end-tidal gas partial
pressure measures are among the most difficult measures to implement.
Skinner and McLellan (1980) provide a succinct description of the events leading to the
anaerobic threshold. They indicate that there is not really a single anaerobic threshold, but,
instead, there are at least two thresholds and three phases to exercise. In phase 1, exercise
progresses at a low, but increasing intensity (Figure 1.3.7). Oxygen is extracted from the

Figure 1.3.7 Concurrent typical changes in blood and respiratory parameters during exercise progressing
from rest to maximum. The transitions from phase I to II is called the aerobic threshold and the transition
from phase II to III is called the anaerobic threshold. (Adapted and redrawn from Skinner and McLellan,
1980, by permission of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance.)
12

In addition, Black et al. (1984) showed that previous exercise raises the anaerobic threshold determined by various ventilatory
methods. Scheen et al. (1981) claim that determination of the anaerobic threshold from the hyperventilation threshold is not
associated with anaerobic threshold based on lactic acid accumulation.

inspired air, resulting in a lower fraction13 of oxygen in the expired air. The expired
concentration of carbon dioxide increases. There is a linear increase in oxygen intake,
ventilation rate, volume of carbon dioxide produced, and heart rate. Respiratory exchange
ratio is in the range of 0.7-0.8. indicating normal carbohydrate aerobic metabolism. Little or
no lactate is formed in this phase.
As exercise intensity increases to a point between 40 and 60% of maximal oxygen
uptake, phase 11 is reached. Oxygen consumption and heart rate both continue to rise linearly.
The rate of lactate accumulation rises and tends to acidify the blood. This acidity is buffered
by blood bicarbonate, resulting in an increased evolution of carbon dioxide. The expired
fraction of carbon dioxide continues to increase. The respiratory controller attempts to
compensate for the increased blood acidity (metabolic acidosis) by stimulating minute
ventilation. This increased ventilation contains the acidity increase within close bounds.
Because of the excess carbon dioxide produced, respiratory exchange ratio increases, but
oxygen, used only to replace ATP, is not removed as much from each breath, so exhaled
oxygen fraction increases. The onset of phase 11 is thus characterized by a nonlinear increase
in ventilation and carbon dioxide removal.
As exercise increases further to 60-90% of maximal oxygen uptake, phase III is entered.
Heart rate and oxygen uptake increase in linear fashion until maximal oxygen uptake is
approached. Blood lactate increases greatly. There is a further increase in minute ventilation
and carbon dioxide excreted, but the hyperventilation no longer compensates for the marked
rise in lactate. Fractional concentration of carbon dioxide begins to decrease, and oxygen
fraction continues to increase. The large increase in respiratory muscle energy expenditure
taxes the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and leaves less oxygen for use by skeletal
muscles. This phase is characterized by a great increase in hyperventilation, which becomes
less and less effective in dealing with the effects of blood lactic acid.
Skinner and McLellan (1980) suggested the terms "aerobic threshold" and "anaerobic
threshold" to apply to the demarcations between phases I and II and between phases II and III.
They suggested blood lactate levels of 2 mol/m3 (2 mmol/L) and 4 mol/m3 (4 mmol/L) as
quantitative definitions of these two thresholds.
Although others (Kindermann et al., 1979; Ribeiro et al., 1985) usually concurred with
these definitions, Schwaberger et al. (1982) indicated that, in individual cases, these empirical
definitions are not an adequate description. Lactate values do not account for individual
differences in metabolism or for dietary effects (Yoshida, 1984). Schwaberger et al. (1982)
thus introduced the concept of "individual anaerobic threshold."
Before reaching the aerobic-anerobic transition, lactate concentration is constant. After
the transition, blood lactate concentration increases:
cLA(t) = cLA(0) + (α/η)P(t)(t – to)

(1.3.8)

where cLA(t) = blood lactic acid concentration, mol/m3
cLA(0) = blood lactic acid concentration below the anaerobic transition, mol/m3
α = proportionality constant, mol/(N·m4)
P(t) = work rate, N·m/sec
η = mechanical efficiency, dimensionless
t = time, sec
t0 = time at aerobic-anaerobic transition, sec
Since the common procedure for determination of anaerobic threshold uses a stepwise
increasing work rate, which can be approximated as a work rate proportional to time,
P(t) = kt
where k = proportionality constant, N·m/sec2
13

See Chapter 4 for a full explanation of these terms.

then
cLA (t) = cLA (0) + (α/η)kt (t – t0)

(1.3.10)

When the rate of lactate production increases above the rate of removal, then the derivative14
of Equation 1.3.10 will be greater than zero:

dcLA α
= k ( 2t − t0 ) > 0

(1.3.11)

At this point, Schwaberger et al. (1982) indicate that the individual anaerobic threshold has
been reached. Figure 1.3.8 illustrates this concept in an individual subject. In general,
Schwaberger et al. found the standard deviations of individual anaerobic threshold values to
be much lower than those for aerobic and anaerobic thresholds based on the 2 mol/m3 and 4

mol/m3 definitions. Individual threshold was indicated at an average blood lactate
concentration of 2.87 ± 0.91 mol/m3; it is claimed to be physiologically well defined and
accounts for individual differences in energy metabolism and lactate kinetics. Since Yeh et al.
(1983) indicated that anaerobic threshold determination through invasive means (arterial and
venous lactate concentrations) is not detectable, and that variability of anaerobic threshold
detection by exercise physiologists reviewing ventilatory data is too large for clinical
application, more positive definitions, such as the individual threshold, are needed.
1.3.6

Oxygen Uptake Kinetics

Whipp et al. (1981) provided a short mathematical description of oxygen uptake transient
changes. Using ramp (linearly increasing) and square wave work rate inputs, they reported
that the dynamics of oxygen uptake are linear and of constant first-order (exponential
response) both below and above the anaerobic threshold. Therefore, any change in oxygen
uptake in response to a step change in work rate is described as
∆VDO 2 (t ) = ∆VDO 2 (ss)(1- e-t/τ )

(1.3.12)

where ∆VDO 2 (t) = oxygen uptake change with time, m3/sec
∆VDO 2 (ss) = difference in oxygen uptake between the old and new steady-state values,
m3/sec
t = time, sec
τ = time, constant
This means that the general first-order differential equation

τ

dVDO 2
dt

+ ∆VDO 2 (t ) = ∆VDO 2 (ss)

(1.3.13)

governs oxygen uptake dynamics.
Oxygen deficit, taken as the accumulated difference between oxygen intake and the
energy equivalent amount of oxygen actually used, is
O2D = ∆VDO 2 (ss) t - ∆VDO2 (ss)
where O2D = oxygen deficit, m3
When t >> τ,

t

∫ (1−e

−t / τ

)dt

c

O2D = τ ∆VO 2 (ss)

(1.3.14)

(1.3.15)

As previously mentioned, work rate is normally chosen to increase at a constant rate, forcing
steady-state oxygen consumption to increase also at a constant rate. Actual oxygen uptake
thus becomes
∆VO 2 (t) = ∆VO 2 (ss)[t – τ (1 – e–t / τ)]

(1.3.16)

which, for t >> τ, reduces to
∆VO 2 (t) = ∆VO 2 (ss)(t – τ)

(1.3.17)

This response is illustrated in Figure 1.3.9.
Powers et al. (1985) studied the effect of maximum oxygen consumption on time

where all terms are as in Equation 1.3.12 except td = dead time, sec. Without the inclusion of
the dead time, to account for the time when there is no measurable change in oxygen uptake
after the beginning of exercise, erroneous values for time constant are calculated.
Powers et al. (1985) found a negative linear relationship between time constant of oxygen
uptake and maximum oxygen consumption (Figure 1.3.10). Those individuals with higher
maximum oxygen uptake achieve a more rapid oxygen uptake adjustment at the onset of
work.
Convertino et al. (1984) presented evidence for an oxygen uptake time constant for
supine exercise roughly twice the time constant for upright exercise. This difference
contributed significantly to the accumulated oxygen debt. There was no difference in final
oxygen uptake between the two exercise modes (Figure 1.3.11).
1.3.7

A Bioenergetics Model

The general scheme of energy utilization by the exercising body was summarized by Margaria
(1976) in a three-compartment hydraulic analog. The three compartments (Figure 1.3.12)
represent aerobic metabolism, lactic acid formation, and phosphagen breakdown. Energy
contributions are modeled by fluid flowing from each hydraulic vessel representing one of the
three.
Morton (1985) described the action of this model as follows:
The fluid in vessel P (representing phosphagen) is directly connected with the outside through the
tap T, which regulates the flow, W (total energy expenditure). At rest, with T closed, the upper level
of fluid in P is the same as in the communication vessel O (representing the oxidative source). The
vessel O is of infinite capacity and is connected through tube R, The second communicating vessel L


22

EXERCISE LIMITATION

Figure 1.3.12 Hydraulic model representing bioenergetics during exercise. (Adapted and redrawn with
permission from Morton, 1985.)
(representing the glycolytic source) is of finite capacity, with upper level the same as the bottom
level of vessel O, apart from a very narrow extension tube, B. The fluid in B, corresponding to the
resting blood lactic acid, is of very small volume relative to L, and does not contribute to any flows
in a measurable amount. L is connected to P through a wider, but one-way tube R2, and P is
connected to L by another, but very much smaller one-way tube, R3.
If T is partly opened, corresponding to a workload W, the level in P falls, inducing a flow through R1
(oxygen consumption, VDO 2 ) in accordance with the difference in levels, h between the two vessels.
This induced flow slows the rate at which the level in P falls, and provided W is not too large, an
equilibrium will be reached at a level above the inlet R1. This level in P is below the resting level,
and fluid flows continuously from O to P and out through T. If the equilibrium is exactly at the level
of R1, then the oxidative mechanism is at its maximum, denoted VO2 max . Once the equilibrium is
established, the only energy mechanism contributing is the oxidative; the exercise is purely aerobic,
and in theory could continue indefinitely. Prior to equilibrium of course, P has contributed some of
its supply, and the empty volume in P above the equilibrium level is known as the alactic oxygen
debt.
If T is now closed, i.e. exercise ceases, P will begin to refill through R1, but at a slower and slower
rate as the level in P returns to normal. When it does so, the flow in R1 ceases and the subject is said
to have repaid his oxygen debt during this recovery period.
If T had been widely opened (severe exercise), the initial situation would be as described above, but
the level in P would fall below R1. This happens after about 50% of the fluid in P has been utilized,
and the subject is said to have crossed his anaerobic threshold. As soon as this happens, two things
occur; the flow in R1 has reached and continues at its maximum, VO2 max , determined only by the
height of the vessel O; and a flow through R2 is induced. This flow is in accordance also with the
difference in levels between vessels L and P (the level, I, in L lagging behind the level in P). The
flow through R2 will slow the fall of level in P, but since the flow through R1 is insufficient and the


MUSCLE METABOLISM

23

capacity in L is limited, the levels in both L and P will continue to fall. If exercise is prolonged, L
and P will be emptied and the subject will be exhausted!
If T is closed at or before exhaustion, P will again be refilled. Initially it will be filled through R1 at
the maximal rate, and through R2 until the lag in levels between L and P has been eliminated. This
latter flow is the delayed lactic acid formation which occurs after cessation of exercise. Once the
levels have been equated, P will fill through R1, initially at the maximal rate and thereafter at a
progressively slower rate as described previously. L will be refilled from P through R3 at a rate in
accordance with the difference in levels between the two. Because R3 is so small, the level in L will
lag behind the level in P: the repayment of this, the lactic oxygen debt is very slow. Finally both P
and L are refilled, and the subject is fully recovered.

Morton (1985) analyzed Margaria's model to obtain a mathematical solution. He began
by setting the total work rate equal to the sum of flows from the three reservoirs:

β M =VD0 −VDP −VDL

(1.3.19)

where M = total rate of work N·m/sec
β = conversion of work to volume, m2/N
V =volume, m3
V =time, sec
and O, P, and L are subscripts denoting the three vessels. V0 is the maximal flow from vessel
O and corresponds to the maximum oxygen uptake. Also, VDP and VDL are expected to be
negative.

The flow from vessel L to vessel P is determined by the difference in levels between the two

Morton (1985) solved mathematically and numerically for the constants C1 and C2 for
several conditions. The mathematics is not repeated here because of the specialized nature of
the solution, and because Morton asserts that the model is not completely specified and must
be modified before further progress can be made. The model as described, however, can give
the reader a means to visualize the metabolic processes during exercise.
1.3.8

Chemical Responses

Before turning totally away from the chemical aspects of muscle metabolism and exercise
responses, a digression here will be useful to indicate to the reader that bodily responses to
exercise are truly complex, highly integrated, and thoroughly redundant. There exists a great
chemical response of the body to exercise, much of which is related to the "fight-or-flight"
reaction for primitive survival, and much of which is manifested in physical changes. These
changes are characterized here and in later chapters. However, it is good to be reminded that
their operation depends on a great number of mechanisms.
Hormonal releases occur naturally during exercise (Naveri, 1985). Of these, the most
familiar hormones are the catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.
These stimulate the nervous system, mobilize free fatty acids, enhance glycogenolysis in liver
and skeletal muscle, and stimulate metabolism (Ganong, 1963). They increase the rate and
force of heart muscle contraction, either dilate or contract small blood vessels, stimulate
breathing, and cause heat to be generated. They work in conjunction with other hormones to
produce the effects already discussed as muscle metabolism.
Other hormones, such as ACTH, thyroxin, and glucagon, also enhance exercise responses
(Dohm et al., 1985; Farrell et al., 1983; Vanhelder et al., 1985). Endorphins, endogeneous
opiates which apparently serve the numerous exercise functions of appetite enhancement, pain
suppression, temperature regulation, metabolic control, ventilation control, and blood pressure
control (Farrell, 1985; Santiago et al., 1981), have also been found to be released during
exercise. Exercise has been shown to produce higher levels of metabolites called prostanoids,
with resulting changes in cardiac and platelet behavior (Rauramaa, 1986; Stebbins and
Longhurst, 1985). Varying levels of nonexercise hormones, such as those produced during the
normal female menstrual cycle, also have been found to influence exercise responses (Berg
and Keul, 1981; Bonen et al., 1983). Descriptive models of some of these systems have
appeared in the literature (Cobelli and Mari, 1983; Hays, 1984; Salzsieder et al., 1985; Swan,
1982) but are beyond the scope of this book.
1.4

CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE LIMITATION

Generally speaking, it is difficult to completely separate cardiovascular exercise limits from
metabolic limits. However, there is a limit to the volume rate of blood movement which can
be delivered by the heart (see Chapter 3), and additional burdens are placed on the heart when
heat production during exercise requires cutaneous vasodilation (see Chapter 5). From Table
1.3.1, we see that exercise durations greater than about 120 sec require at least 50% aerobic
metabolism. It is in this region that exercise performance becomes sensitive to blood oxygen
delivery. If the cardiovascular system is incapable of delivering sufficient oxygen to the
skeletal muscles, then it will not be long before the maximum oxygen debt which the
individual can incur will be reached and the individual will be unable to continue. Practically
speaking, the cardiovascular limitation to exercise is seen for exercise duration of 120-600
see, unless there is a respiratory impairment, in which case the cardiovascularly limited
exercise duration range is about 120-240 sec. The heart reacts to exercise more rapidly than
other bodily systems (Table 1.4.1).

Measurements on an exercising subject are seen in Figure 1.4.1 (Johnson, 1976). The
work rate was only 150 N·m/sec, which allowed the subject to continue exercising for nearly
6000 sec (100 min). Heart rate moves rapidly to its equilibrium value of about 2.33 beats/sec
(140 beats/min). Exhalation time as an indicator of respiratory stress (Johnson and Berlin,
1974; Johnson and Curtis, 1978) decreases somewhat more slowly than heart rate to its
equilibrium value near 1.1 sec. Rectal temperature slowly rises from about 37.4°C at the
beginning of the session to 38.8°C at the end. After rectal temperature reaches about 37.5°C
there is a secondary rise in heart rate, which continues at a rate of about 0.428 beat per second
per degree Celsius [25.7 beats/(min·°C)] as long as rectal temperature rises. At about the same
time as the start of the secondary rise in heart rate, a fall in exhalation time occurs. If the work
rate had been higher, the rise of rectal temperature would have been lower, exhalation time
would have tended toward, and be limited at, 0.5 sec, heart rate would have gone quickly to a
higher value, and performance time would have been much shorter.15
15

Therefore, in designing experimental studies, the work rate and anticipated performance time should be chosen to be sensitive
to the particular stress that is the object of the test. An experiment testing heat stress should be designed to last much longer
than an experiment testing cardiovascular stress.

EXERCISE LIMITATION

RESPIRATORY LIMITATION

Respiratory adjustments (see Chapter 4) to exercise are slower than cardiovascular
adjustments, so that a respiratory limitation, if seen at all, requires a longer time to manifest
itself than the cardiovascular limitation. It is generally conceded that for normal, healthy
individuals, there is no limit to exercise performance imposed by the respiratory system
(Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). However, should the individuals suffer from respiratory function
impairment, then there appears to be a definite relationship between exercise performance and
respiratory functioning (Johnson and Berlin, 1974; Johnson and Curtis, 1978).16 In our testing
of subjects wearing respiratory protective masks, we have generally seen evidence of
respiratory limitation to exercise for constant work rates of duration of about 240-1200 sec.
Martin et al. (1984) found that ventilation levels associated with peak exercise levels
approaching maximum oxygen uptake require anaerobic metabolism by the respiratory
muscles. This can significantly add to blood lactate levels and presumably reduce the
additional amount of oxygen debt utilized by the skeletal muscles in their performance of
anaerobic work. This accumulation of blood lactate also probably contributes to overall
muscle fatigue.
1.6

THERMAL LIMITATION

It takes a relatively long time for the excess heat generated during exercise to warm the body
sufficiently that the individual must either quit exercising or suffer severe discomfort or even
death (see Chapter 5). The rate of heat accumulation will depend to a great extent on
physiological adjustments during exercise, the rate of exercise, the size of the individual,
environmental factors, and clothing worn. Depending on the motivation of the individual, he
or she may tolerate severe thermal discomfort before quitting. A usually conservative upper
limit on deep body temperature is 39.2°C (102.5°F) before requiring the termination of
exercise.17 It will require at least 600 sec of steady exercise to reach this temperature.18 The
upper range for exercise duration ending in a thermal end point is probably 3600-7200 sec
(1-2h) in moderate environmental conditions.
Physiological mechanisms underlying the reason that hyperthermia limits muscular work
are not clearly identified. Obviously, thermal discomfort is a factor determining cessation of
exercise. There appears also to be a strong effect of muscle temperature on its metabolism
(Kozlowski et al., 1985). Higher muscle temperatures result in decreased levels of ATP and
creatine phosphate, more rapid muscle glycogen depletion, and higher levels of muscle lactate
and pyruvate (Figure 1.6.1). These effects indicate that higher temperatures reduce the ability
of muscles to work.
1.7

PROLONGED EXERCISE

Exercise performed for a prolonged time results in a number of slower and more subtle
physiological effects becoming more important for performance. Over a long time, a general
16

In general, the higher the maximum oxygen uptake of the individual, the smaller the ventilatory response to exercise
(Morrison et al.. 1983).
One subject whom we tested, a physically fit U.S. Marine, had a jump from 39.0°C (102.2°F) to 40.0°C (104°F) rectal
temperature in the 600 sec between readings. He was stripped and put into ice water to cool down from this life-threatening
temperature. Although we have seen nothing like this rate of rise in other individuals, for this particular individual, 39.2°C was
not conservative enough.
18
To heat up while exercising requires reducing the rate of exercise to allow sufficient time for heat to accumulate.

feeling of fatigue may be the reason for quitting, although what constitutes fatigue is not well
known. A drop in blood glucose and depletion of muscle glycogen stores appear to be
involved (Astrand and Rodahl, 1970). Dehydration due to protracted sweating can be a
limiting factor, as can solute balance from loss of salt.
Small irritations produced by clothing or equipment chafing the skin or psychological
factors may prove to be the limiting factor to exercise performance. In general, subjects who
are kept mentally distracted exercise longer.
A workload of 50% of maximum oxygen uptake is too high for work to last all day. Work
lasting this long is usually performed in a steady-state physiological condition.
Fatigue during prolonged exercise has long been thought to be related to depletion of
muscle glycogen. The Daedalus human-powered flight from the island of Crete to the Aegean
island of Santorini, a distance of 119 km, was expected to last about 21,600 sec (6 h) at a
physiological power cost of 900 N·m/sec (Nadel and Bussolari, 1988). Prolonged exercise
such as this, without breaks, of course, usually eventually leads to a depletion of muscle
glycogen and a concomitant reduction in plasma glucose, followed by a plasma volume
reduction (from sweating) and a rise in heart rate (to maintain the required cardiac output
despite a reduction in blood volume). Nadel and Bussolari describe their empirical testing of
potential Daedalus pilots and the development of a drink to replenish blood glucose, plasma
volume, and blood electrolytes. They were successful in avoiding plasma glucose declines
over six hours of prolonged bicycle ergometer exercise, and their subjects were able to
perform for at least that amount of time. The rest is history: the Daedalus flew the required
distance, making it the longest man-powered flight at that time.
