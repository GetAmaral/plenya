# Laboratory Evaluations for Integrative and Functional Medicine
## Chapter 11: Genomics

Richard S. Lord and J. Alexander Bralley

With the sequencing of the human genome, there
has been an explosion of interest in identifying the genetic components of disease processes. The subsequent
ability to identify individuals with these genetic tendencies affords medical science a potential new tool to predict, prevent and intervene in many different illnesses,
especially those that are chronic in nature. This chapter
will give a brief overview of this emerging field and how
routine genomic laboratory assessments may influence
integrative, functional medicine now, and in the future.

Imagine the genome is a book.

All living organisms utilize a system of information storage and transmission contained in the genetic
material. In mammals these are organized into genes
contained in the larger structure of the chromosomes.
It is hard to comprehend the implications of the human
genome, which revealed its amazing complexity with the
initial sequencing in 2002. A thought-provoking analogy
is presented in Matt Ridley’s Genome: The Autobiography
of a Species in 23 Chapters.1

Transcription

There are twenty-three chapters,
called Chromosomes.

Each chapter contains several thousand stories,
called Genes.

Each story is made up of paragraphs,
called Exons,
which are interrupted by advertisements,
called Introns.
Each paragraph is made up of words,
called Codons.
Each word is written in letters called Bases.
There are 1 billion words in the book…which
makes it longer than 800 Bibles.

All genes are composed of the same compound,
deoxyribonucleic acid, commonly known as DNA.
All DNA is composed of a purine base (adenine and
guanine) and a pyrimidine base (cytosine and thymine).
The bases combine with the sugar, deoxyribose and

synthesis.

phosphate to form the four nucleotides (A, G, C and T),
which make up the double helix strand of DNA. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is very similar in its components,
except uracil is substituted for thymine and the sugar
component is ribose.
There are an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 genes
contained in the human genome. Less than half of them
have a known function. There are more than 3 billion
nucleotides in this genome. The average gene is about
3,000 nucleotides long, although the size can vary
substantially. Interestingly enough, only about 3% of the
structure of the human genome is used to regulate body
function through what is called the “Central Dogma” of
molecular biology (Figure 11.1).
The central dogma states that the chromosomal
DNA is replicated for cellular reproduction. In the
newly formed cell, the DNA strand containing a gene is
unraveled and transcribed into an RNA molecule, which
migrates out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. There it

one allele from each parent. These alleles may be the
same or may be different from one another. A SNP can
reside on either or both alleles. An allele with no SNP at
a particular location on the DNA sequence of the gene is
referred to as “wild type,” or the most common form of
the gene.
If one allele has a SNP and the other doesn’t, the
individual is heterozygous for that gene, meaning the
SNP was derived from one parent. A heterozygous
gene product may or may not produce properties in
the individual that may deviate from the wild type.
For example, if the gene codes for a protein molecule
performing an enzymatic function, this may be altered
by the SNP in one of the two alleles. One allele will code
for the “normal” wild-type form; the other with the SNP
will code for a slightly altered protein whose function
may be significantly less efficient. How these two alleles
are expressed will determine the level of function the
individual has. In general, heterozygotic individuals
tend to maintain good function, although this is a topic
of some debate. This concept can give rise to the wide
range of function seen in the population regarding
genetic nutritional need.

## Genetic Variability

attaches to a ribosomal structure that translates the three
nucleotide codes into the primary sequence of amino
acids of a protein. Protein functions may be classified as
internal or external. Internal proteins act on substances
generated by the body internally. These are the enzymes
and structural proteins. Proteins that act on substances
arising from outside the body are external, the primary
group being the immunoglobulins that confer resistance
to microbial penetration into the system. Any errors in
transcribed amino acid sequences can lead to malformed
proteins and inefficient or, at worst, ineffective catalytic
or structural function of the protein molecule. Genelevel alterations that produce variation in protein
structures are the basis of genetic disorders or inborn
errors of metabolism.
Over 99% of the human genome is identical in
all humans. It is the other 1% that represents the broad
variations in human traits, abilities and risk of disease.
The genetic structure of an individual is referred to
as the genotype of the individual. The expression of
this genotype is referred to as the phenotype of the
individual. Variations in the genotype give rise to
variations in the phenotype.

Given the ability of modern science to easily detect
and evaluate the effects of these SNPs on human health,
an era of what is being referred to as “personalized
medicine” is evolving. Two areas where this is happening
rapidly are pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics.

Figure 11.3 — Proportion of Drugs

Metabolized by Common CYPs

The primary way in which drugs are metabolized is
through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme system
found mostly in the liver. Most drugs are metabolized by
at least one CYP; many are metabolized by multiple CYPs.

The conventional approach to pharmacotherapy is
for physicians to prescribe drugs for an individual based
on population studies and clinical trials. If a particular
drug was not effective or had undue side effects, the
dosage may be adjusted or another drug used. Finding
an effective drug and dosage may, therefore, take several
months. Physicians must rely heavily on their clinical
experience and population-based studies. Therapeutic drug monitoring in blood has been used for years
to guide clinicians in cases where maintaining safe
and effective blood levels for the patient were critical
and achievable. On the other hand, if clinicians could
predict which drug would be effective and at what dose,
then pharmacotherapy could be individualized. This is
the goal of pharmacogenomics.
Pharmacogenomics testing attempts to predict how
an individual will respond to a drug based on their
genetic makeup. The two main areas to which pharmacogenomics can be applied are drug metabolism and
responsiveness. The primary way in which drugs are
metabolized is through the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
isoenzyme system found mostly in the liver. Most drugs
are metabolized by at least one CYP; many are metabolized by multiple CYPs. Specific dosing guidelines based
on pharmacogenetic data are being developed and are
beginning to appear in the literature to predict adverse
drug reactions (ADR).3 Genotype-based dosage guidelines have been published for a number of drugs.4–7
Current genetic variants of CYPs can be identified
through several commercially available assays as well
as through clinical laboratory-developed tests. The CYP
variant can affect the metabolic phenotype through
changes in protein expression, structure, functional
stability and/or substrate specificity. The CYP activity
is expressed as four major categories: extensive or
normal metabolizer (EM), the ultrafast metabolizer
(UM), the intermediate metabolizer (IM) and the poor
or slow metabolizer (PM). These designations have

been extensively studied for several CYPs, and clinically
significant variance can be seen among ethnic groups.8, 9
Figure 11.3 shows the proportion of drugs metabolized
by different CYPs.
The other application of pharmacogenomic testing
is in the area of drug responsiveness. Population-based
clinical trials for drug efficacy suffer from the same variability of drug response as previously discussed. A recent
example is the drug Verceptin, developed by Genentech.
In initial clinical trials on a broad population base, the
effectiveness of the drug did not reach FDA standards
for efficacy and was not approved for human use. However, when patients were evaluated for genetic makeup,
a different picture emerged. In women who were
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive,
Verceptin produced significantly better effects on reducing metastatic breast cancer than in women who were
HER2-negative. Genentech teamed with Dako Corporation to develop a test for HER2 positivity. Both the drug
and the test received FDA approval for this application
in 1998. By targeting the population sensitive to the
drug, patients with this form of cancer receive a positive

therapeutic outcome, whereas general population-based
analysis would have eliminated this choice to those who
would benefit. This illustrates the potential promise of
pharmacogenomics in drug development.
This aspect of genomic testing for pharmacotherapeutics, coupled with improved and extended therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) techniques and biomarker
assessment, can develop into a powerful strategy for
personalized medicine. These approaches coupled with
other integrative medicine techniques will have lasting
influence on the style of medicine practice in the future.

Kaput lays out five principal tenets of
nutrigenomics:
(1) improper diets in some individuals and
under some conditions are risk factors for chronic
diseases; (2) common dietary chemicals alter gene
expression and/or genome structure; (3) the influence of diet on health depends upon an individual’s genetic makeup; (4) some genes or their
normal common variants are regulated by diet,
which may play a role in chronic diseases; and (5)
dietary interventions based upon knowledge of
nutritional requirements, nutritional status, and
genotype can be used to develop individualized
nutrition plans that optimize health and prevent
or mitigate chronic diseases.13

The interaction of environment and gene expres­sion is illustrated in Figure 11.4. Genotype testing is
not meant to determine who is inclined to get cancer or
heart disease; rather, it is designed to predict who will
benefit most from specific diet and nutrient changes.
Most of the SNP testing currently done for nutrigenomics

Another aspect of personalized medicine, nutri­
genomics, has been defined as the study of the interface between genes and the nutritional environment.
Nutri­genomics is being proposed as a new model in
healthcare, where genotyping can help determine which
foods and food supplements are best consumed by an
individual to optimize their health and prevent or mitigate metabolic diseases. Researchers in this field seek to
define how genetic variation affects a person’s response
to various dietary nutrients.10-12

has focused on patients who are at risk of health problems associated with a particular nutrient. A relatively
well-known example is folate metabolism related to
the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR). This enzyme converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a cofactor
in remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine.
Homozygous SNPs in the gene coding for this enzyme
have been associated with increased homcysteine and
cardiovascular disease risk and increased risk of neural
tube defect births in pregnant women.14, 15 Researchers
have found the C677T homozygous SNP in the MTHFR
gene is quite prevalent, occurring in 18% of Caucasians
and 10% of Hispanics.16 This homozygous form produces a protein enzyme that is more heat labile than the
wild type, thereby causing reduced enzymatic activity.
Nutrigenomic testing can identify those individuals who
could benefit by increased folate supplementation.

metabolite is necessary to determine effective intervention procedures for the patient. In a sense, it almost begs
the question of whether genomic testing is really costeffective for patients or should they just proceed with
function analysis of nutrient demands. The genetic issue
may be expressed, but additional testing is still required.
On the other hand, if a functional impairment is found,
then the genetic testing can shed light on the need for
further assessment in family lines.

Conclusions

## Further Considerations

Notes:

Although nutrigenomics holds great promise, some
experts have expressed caution regarding the present scientific support for conclusions drawn from the research.
The genome is exceedingly complex, and with over one
million SNPs already identified, there is still not a complete understanding of the interactions that can occur to
affect health. Recently an advisory action was issued by
the FTC and the Government Accountability Office stating that direct-to-the-consumer (at-home) nutrigenomic
testing lacked scientific evidence to fully justify conclusions and recommendations based on the test results.17
A principal limitation with nutrigenomic testing
is the question of the phenotypic expression of genetic variations. Even if a person has, for example, an
MTHFR homozygous C677T SNP, one does not know
for certain to what extent overall function is affected. Is
there a functional limitation that justifies suggesting that
the person take folate and how much? Is it enough to
compensate for the loss of enzymatic function? Are there
mitigating factors that obviate the need for additional
folate? To answer these questions, functional metabolic
testing would still need to be done, that is, in this case,
measurement of plasma homocysteine levels. This is true
for many of the genomic tests that suggest functional
defects, be they detoxification issues or increased risk
of osteoporosis. In each case, measure of the functional

This brief synopsis of genomic testing offers a
sampling of the enormous breadth of information the
human genome project has generated. Some experts
estimate that the majority of new medical tests in the
future will revolve around genetic testing. From identifying infectious agents to assessing which drug and what
dosage or which nutrient might be needed in excess,
genomics will play a key role. For further reading see

Combined COMT and MTHFR Homozygous Effects

for the low clearance of vanilmandelic acid (VMA), the
metabolite of norepinephrine and epinephrine, and lownormal clearance of homovanillate (HVA), the metabolite
of dopamine. Since COMT is involved in the catabolism
of these catecholamines, it is not surprising that low
turnover is evidenced in this patient with a low-activity
homozygous SNP in the enzyme. It may be that the reduced
catabolism of catecholamines, particularly norepinephrine
and epinephrine, is contributing to this individual’s clinical
panic disorder. Low-activity COMT SNP has been associated
with increased incidence of anxiety and panic disorder,
particularly in women.21,22
On the other hand, evidence for lack of functional impact
of the MTHFR polymorphism is found by the normal
homocysteine shown in section B of her laboratory data.
She has no history of hyperhomocysteinemia, so her
MTHFR appears to be functioning at a level adequate to
meet metabolic demands, despite the presence of the SNP.
The conversion of homocysteine to methionine via methyl
transfer from SAMe is functioning adequately. Thus, her
ability to sustain adequate SAMe for methylation reactions
appears normal. This is an important distinction in managing
this patient.

History: A 31-year-old female presented with long-term
panic disorder with a recent onset of agoraphobia. Her family
history is significant, with a mother with anxiety disorder
and agoraphobia, one sister with a long-term panic disorder
and alcoholism and another sister with anxiety disorder.
Genetic Testing: Genetic laboratory testing revealed
that the patient is homozygous for a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the catecholamine-O-methyl
transferase (COMT) enzyme, resulting in significantly
reduced enzymatic activity (low activity). Her mother is
heterozygous for the same COMT SNP. Further, the patient is
homozygous for a SNP in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR) enzyme, which also results in reduced
enzymatic capacity. The patient’s sisters have not undergone
genetic testing.
COMT and MTHFR are both involved in methylation
activity. COMT is an enzyme responsible for the clearance of
catechol compounds, including norepinephrine, epinephrine,
dopamine and some estrogen derivatives. COMT catalyzes
an O-methyltransferase reaction that requires the methyl
donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as a cofactor. MTHFR
is responsible for the final step in the methylation of folic
acid, generating 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-FH4).
5-methyl-FH4 is involved in the
methylation cycle, where it donates its
methyl group to B12 in the recycling
of homocysteine to methionine.
Trimethylglycine (betaine) is also able to

Discussion: Supplementation with high-dose methylated
folic acid and betaine (trimethylglycine) was initiated
based on the SNP findings prior to metabolic function
evaluation. Soon after starting this regimen, the patient
reported an increase in presenting complaints and the
onset of agoraphobia. The symptom exacerbation could be
caused by increased production of SAMe from the combined

methylated with unmethylated folic acid and discontinuation
of betaine, symptoms greatly improved, including a
resolution of the agoraphobia.

Discussion: Glycine conjugation (GC) is a Phase II

with carboxylic acids. Conjugation with glycine increases
solubility of the aromatic acids so that they may be

substrate is plentiful, and the problem lies in the GPC
enzyme. Since xylene exposure is virtually ubiquitous
for urban residents such as these 2 patients, the low or
undetectable 2-methylhippurate levels add to the suspicion
of GPC deficiency. In case A, gasoline, a source of xylene, is
associated with migraine activity.
Optimizing liver Phase II biotransformation activity,
particularly alternative amino acid conjugation pathways,
is a therapeutic goal for both individuals. Since glycine is
proscribed due to risk of generating hyperoxaluria from
greatly elevated glycine, supplement considerations include
pantothenic acid, taurine and glutathione. Taurine spares
glycine utilization, making it more available for conjugation
reactions.

Healthy individuals have a large capacity for glycine
conjugation, and, under heavy loading, the reaction can
cause depletion of glycine as discussed in Chapters 6,
“Organic Acids,” and 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification.”
Many patients have moderate benzoate loading. If glycine
conjugation activity is normal, then they show elevated
urinary hippurate with normal benzoate. Heavy loading of
the conjugation pathway produces elevation of benzoate
and hippurate. In both of the cases presented here, however,
benzoate is high, whereas hippurate is 1st quintile (A) or
undetectable (B). These findings indicate compromised
conjugation capacity. This is especially evident in A,
where high plasma glycine is found. Thus the conjugation
