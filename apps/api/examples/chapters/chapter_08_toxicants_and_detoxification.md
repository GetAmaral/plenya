Assessment of Major Toxin-Removal Organs

The human body is constantly in the presence
of potentially harmful agents. It could be argued that
any disease process can be caused or complicated by
toxic load. Indeed, the health effects of xenobiotic
chemicals is drawing increased governmental attention as indicated by the CDC expanding its monitoring
of over 200 foreign chemicals and elements humans
have in their systems. Environmental compounds can
gain entry through the skin, the gastrointestinal tract
and the lungs. The field of toxicology primarily deals
with environmental toxin exposures and detoxification
mechanisms. However, when considering the total toxic
load, one must include endogenous products of digestion, energetic metabolism, tissue regeneration, neuronal activity and various cellular control mechanisms
that produce compounds that can be injurious unless
removed from the body. For example, endogenous ammonia production can easily become the predominant
source of toxicants. The total toxic load is composed of
human metabolic products and exogenous sources such
as microbial metabolites, food-borne components and

man-made environmental chemicals. Detoxification is
the process of transforming and removing potentially
harmful products from the body, and has its own energy,
nutrient and regulatory requirements. Diseases result
when detoxification is inadequate to handle the load
and the toxicants interfere with normal cellular function. This chapter addresses assessment of overall risk,
individual biotransformation capacity, and monitoring
efficacy of detoxification strategies.
Individual responses to toxin exposure are highly
variable due to differences in barrier integrity, biotransformation enzyme activities, eliminative functions and
general state of organ reserve. The degree to which
disease outcomes are influenced by toxicants depends
on levels of exposure and how well the protective
mechanisms (influenced by genetic factors) keep tissuelevel toxic effects in check. Laboratory assessments can
be employed to assess the details of these factors so that
specific weaknesses may be addressed.
The last half of the twentieth century was a time of
explosive growth of information detailing the extent of
industrial toxin release into the environment and the
magnitude of human responses to toxins of any origin1, 2

serve as reminders of the omnipresent role of toxins in
determining disease and wellness.

Terminology and Scope

Toxicology has been defined as the branch of science dealing with poisons.9 As commonly used, poison
implies a substance not normally encountered that
causes harmful effects. Extracts from foxglove, baneberry
and hemlock are examples of the many poisons made by
plants. To these we must add the toxic metals like arsenic
and lead and synthetic chemicals like sulfuric acid and
Agent Orange to begin a complete listing of the tens of
thousands of substances that might be labeled “poison.”
Cellular function may be affected by self-generated
metabolic stresses as well as environmental toxins. In
this chapter the discussion of testing for toxic exposures
and the body’s detoxification mechanisms will focus on
substances not normally found in human tissues.
The terms toxin, toxicant and toxic substance will
be used interchangeably to describe potentially harmful
agents. The term detoxification, derived from the verb
“to detoxify” will be used in preference to the shortened form, detoxication. Acute or chronic exposure can
manifest as a poisonous episode or as a contributory
factor to a degenerative disease state. Comprehensive
lists of toxins and levels of release into the environment
are available.6-8

coupled with our growing understanding of the mechanisms of human detoxification. Clinical effects depend
on the combination of toxin load and individual capacities to detoxify. Common clinical clues that point to
toxin effects are degeneration in hair, skin, nails, mucous
membranes and reproductive function. Beyond these
early signs of toxic effects, the list of known toxin-related
disorders is very long. Physician associations for discussion of scientific advances and for training in clinical
protocols have grown up in response to the growing
number of patients who present with syndromes called
multiple chemical sensitivity or multisensory sensitivity.
This chapter maintains a primary focus on laboratory
evaluations for assessing human toxin exposure and
capacities for detoxification.
Tests that monitor some of the major hepatic detoxification pathways supply specific insight about potential
weaknesses. For example, knowing the status of ammonia challenge and glutathione demand can identify need
for supporting urea cycle and sulfur compound utilization to bolster a patient’s ability to eliminate toxicants.
Measurements of hepatic detoxification function, heavy
metal status, and gastrointestinal function can identify
potential toxic influences that can then be coupled with
nutritional treatments to develop an overall strategy of
improving organ function and overall health.
The subject of chronic low-level toxin exposures
that may contribute to complex diseases is only beginning to be explored and may have far-reaching impacts
on human health. Standard medical training addresses
detoxification only in limited areas of patient care, such
as drug clearance rates, microbial toxin exposure, and
the carcinogenicity of environmental chemicals.
Amongst functional or integrative medical practition­
ers, however, there is an active recognition of low-level
toxin exposures as a cause of undesirable clinical effects.3, 4 By their nature, low level chronic toxin exposure
effects are difficult to reproduce. The weight of favorable anecdotal reports of improvements from interventions focused on removing toxin burden, improving
detoxification functions and reducing tissue responses to
immune sequelae make it hard for informed clinicians
to discount toxicant effects. Detoxification programs can
result in an improved sense of well-being, even for “disease-free” individuals. For example, a hypoallergenic diet
supplemented with a broad-spectrum macro- and micronutrient drink and intake of at least two quarts of filtered
water per day produced significant improvements in

Notes:

been serious proposals to adopt hormesis as the default
dose-response model in risk assessment.12
The hormesis concept is a new way of thinking
about nutrient and toxicant effects. Toxicants, traditionally thought to have negative effects, and nutrients that
are known to have such positive effects actually can have
both positive and negative effects, depending on dose.
The toxic potential for vitamin A at very high intake is a
well-known reversal phenomenon, along with the effects
of most pharmaceuticals, as mentioned previously. Other
examples of the hormesis concept abound. A compound
that is normally quite safe, such as glutamic acid, can
become the agent of brain neurotoxic degeneration in
Alzheimer’s disease,13 and insulin can be the agent responsible for pregnancy-induced hypertension.14 On the
other hand, the “poison” effects of certain herbal extracts
may become beneficial at very low exposures. Finally,
intestinal bacterial products that can overload hepatic
detoxification pathways under conditions of overgrowth
may well become helpful at lower concentrations. This is
the case for the products of Lactobacillus acidophilus as
described in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.”

Dose-Response Curve and the Hormesis Model. The
nature of the dose-response has long been considered as
that of a threshold above which exposures cause an effect,
and below which no effect occurs (Figure 8.1). The presumption of a sigmoidal dose-response curve has led to
studies focusing on high-dose toxicology and the development of calculated values such as the lowest observed
adverse effect level (LOAEL). A large number of compounds have been studied in order to identify doses that
are likely to be at or above the no-observed-adverse-effect
level (NOAEL). However, this concept is incomplete
when evaluating toxicant effects in biological systems.
The hormesis model is less familiar, but perhaps a
more appropriate dose-response curve for understanding toxicant action in the body. It indicates opposite
responses or positive benefit at very low and very
high exposures. The name “hormesis” first appeared
in scientific publication in 1943 to describe biphasic
fungal responses to red cedar extracts. A stimulation of
fungal growth by red cedar extracts at high concentration was found to revert to an inhibitory effect at very
low concentration.10 Studies in the late 1800s found that
chemical disinfectants demonstrated inhibitory effects
on yeast metabolism at high doses, whereas stimulatory effects were seen at low doses.11 A large and rapidly
growing number of well-controlled demonstrations of
the principle have been reported and alternately have
been described as U-shaped, J-shaped, biphasic or bell
shaped dose-response curves (Figure 8.2). There have

Figure 8.1 — Models for Representing

Dose-Responses of Toxicants

The threshold model presumes a progressively lower
response from high exposures all the way down to the
threshold dose (the dose of zero response). The threshold
model presumes there is no significant effect below the
threshold dose. In the Hormetic model, levels below the
threshold generate effects in the opposite direction from
those above the threshold. Responses may be measures
of carcinogenicity, apoptosis, mitochondrial function or
other parameters that reflect cellular or tissue function.
Figure 8.2 — The Hormesis Model

of Toxicant Effects12

The hormesis model may apply to most toxicant
effects in biological systems. The effect holds whether
the response is measured for individual toxicants or
combinations. The threshold and slope of the response
versus dose curve varies as shown for Toxicant 1
relative to Toxicant 2. Combined exposure produces
a new, frequently more severe response (Toxicant 1 +
Toxicant 2). Nutrient status can modify the threshold,
and specific nutrient deficiency can significantly worsen
the response at a given exposure.

used to evaluate toxic potential, strong arguments have
been made that, on average, environmental chemicals
are of minor importance compared with carcinogens
found in foods. Over 1,000 chemicals have been detected in roasted coffee: more than half of those tested
(19 of 28) are rodent carcinogens.18 This finding does
not mean that drinking coffee is dangerous, but rather
that there are enormous safety factors built into worstcase scenarios of rodent cancer testing. Humans can
eat the tremendous variety of natural chemical “rodent
carcinogens” because we are extremely well protected by
many defense systems. Of course, carcinogenicity is not
the only concern, and many circumstances cause exposures far above the average for the general population.
Hypospermia and chronic progressive nephropathy are
produced in rats by moderate phthalate exposure.19
Food Packaging. Phthalate esters, used in the production of plastics are an environmental insult of high
concern from food packaging chemical contaminants.
Chronic exposure of rats to di(2‑ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) causes decreased kidney function and a
significantly higher incidence of focal cysts.21 Patients
on hemodialysis are an example of special exposure
because they have been regularly exposed to unusually high amounts of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate used in
the manufacture of plastic tubing.20 Increased hepatocarcinogenesis in rodent liver accompanied by high
levels of peroxisome proliferation were found at DEHP

We live in a world increasingly laden with manmade chemicals and toxic metals released from industrial processes. Most people in “advanced” nations no longer scratch out their living from farming and livestock.
We also have the challenge of living in a world where
the “normal” detoxification pathways lack “normal”
stimulation and where “abnormal” exposures abound. In
this context, “normal” refers to those levels of exposure
for pre-industrialized human society. There are multiple
ways of classifying toxicants. Table 8.2 shows division
into inorganic and organic chemicals with subdivision
by source.
Xenobiotics are compounds that are not produced
in biological systems. Their occurrence in significant
amounts in human tissues is generally due to activities of civilization. The demands of modern society for
plastics, alloys and convenience foods have led to higher
levels of exposure and greater variety of toxins. Some
important sources of toxins are pesticides, food, food
packaging, organotoxins and pharmaceuticals.
Pesticides. Stimulated by public concerns over
widespread use of insecticides, especially DDT, the
specialty of pesticide toxicology is now providing insight
into the range of effects from residues on food.7 Living
with higher toxin loads must be viewed as a side effect
of human advancement in pest control, crop production
and convenience items. The introduction of chlorinated
hydrocarbon pesticides, especially DDT, improved
the control of insect-borne diseases in humans. For
example, monthly malaria incidence dropped from
over 70 per 1,000 inhabitants in some towns of Italy
to virtually undetectable levels after DDT was used to
reduce mosquitoes.15 The initial successes have led to an
ever-growing number and amount of pesticides used for
disease control and improved crop yields. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a pesticide used industrially as a wood
preservative for utility poles, railroad ties and wharf
pilings. Advances such as PCP must be weighed against
toxic threats of the agents employed. Extensive reviews
of pesticide classifications, toxicities16 and effects of
pesticides on the immune system17 are available.
Foods. To maintain perspective on the relative contributions of man-made and natural toxicants, we note
that foods are quite laden with chemicals that add to the
toxic burden of human tissues. When carcinogenicity is

recommended human dose.28
Scientists recognize the political problem of raising
issues that might call for costly industrial or governmental action.29, 30 Widespread concern about such subjects
has led to the formation of professional medical organizations such as the American Academy of Environmental
Medicine (aaem.com) and the American Environmental
Health Foundation (aehf.com). The Federal Clean Water
Act currently lists about 300 substances as hazardous
industrial discharges into waterways, and it establishes
the minimum amount of spillage that must be reported
to the National Response Center. The difficulty in controlling small discharges is illustrated by the allowance
of companies to release 999 pounds of benzene without
reporting.31 There are many reports of such instances
and numerous reviews of health threats from environmental chemicals.32-35

exposures above 500 ppm.22 These are two of several
potential toxic consequences of chronic low-level exposure to phthalates. Human exposure levels to several
hundreds of compounds are being actively monitored
by geographical region in the United States. The US
government23 and the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention24 maintain Web sites rich in information
on toxin exposures.
Pharmaceuticals. Because pharmaceuticals are
usually designed to produce alterations in normal
metabolism, toxic side effects must be evaluated as a
routine part of their development. Acetaminophen exerts
toxic effects by lowering hepatic glutathione and sulfate
reserves.26 Thiazolidinediones used for diabetes produce
highly unpredictable hepatotoxicity.27 These effects
may be long-term, insidious changes that are difficult
to associate with the medication. Other exposures
produce more rapid effects, such as changes in brain
and mitochondrial function. For example, single doses
of the Alzheimer’s drug mimetidine (a derivative of

Multiple sources may contribute to total exposure for any of the toxin classes shown. The class of toxin determines the
phases of detoxification required for removal.

Notes:

Since increased toxicant exposure is a modern fact
of life, the clinical impact relies on the body’s ability to
remove toxins. Toxin management requires adequate
nutritional resources. A significant portion of total
body energy generation, as well as integrated function
of the gastrointestinal, hepaticobiliary, cardiovascular,
renal, lung, skin and immune systems are required. The
overall functions are to prevent toxin entry, to identify
toxins that penetrate the barriers, to modify toxins into
more easily managed forms and to provide mechanisms
for removal. The immune system is included in this
discussion because of the central importance of handling
macromolecular and cellular agents that can cause such
devastating effects via the combination of atopic reactions and large antigen-antibody complexes as described
in Chapter 7, “GI Function.” Such reactions may be
considered components of detoxification.
Humans are protected from the effects of diseaseproducing substances by physical, chemical and

immunologic barriers. The skin and mucosal surfaces
make up the physical barriers. The immunologic
barrier is maintained by the secretion of special classes
of antibodies, mainly secretory IgA, which bind to
large molecules recognized as foreign to the body. The
chemical barrier is made up of the gastric secretions
of the stomach and the extracellular and intracellular
enzyme systems of the tissues.
The gastrointestinal tract is the major source or
entry route for toxic substances. The portal vein delivers compounds that are water soluble directly to the
liver, whereas lipid-soluble compounds enter systemic
circulation via the lymphatic system along with dietary
fat. Tissue distribution of toxins depends on the route
of entry. The lungs provide a very efficient surface for
transfer directly to systemic blood and from there to
central nervous tissue or to sites like adipose tissue,
where accumulation is favored because of slow turnover.
Entry through the skin, likewise, is a route that bypasses
the liver and favors toxin accumulation in adipose tissue
without being modified by detoxification enzymes.

Figure 8.4 — Schematic Representation of Variables Governing Toxic Consequences
Increased exposures or genetically impaired functions of barrier maintenance, biotransformation enzyme activities or
elimination mechanisms may overload or cause dysfunctional detoxification systems. These effects manifest as exacerbations
of various patient conditions.

Mechanisms of Cell Injury
Induced by Toxins

Toxicants may be injurious via interferences with
DNA regulatory events, poisoning of enzyme-active sites,
binding to regulatory sites of receptors and depleting
stores of cofactors. Some toxicants have highly tissuespecific effects. For example, methyl mercury causes
selective necrosis to the cerebellum. Evidence has shown
that such compounds make the cells more vulnerable to
reactive oxygen species because they deplete cerebral glutathione, thereby reducing cellular antioxidant capacity.36
Chronic toxicant exposure acts to deplete critical cell
growth factors. Figure 8.5 shows the effect of increasing
doses of benzoic acid on hepatic stores of glycine and
coenzyme A. This effect is easily offset by supplementation with glycine and pantothenic acid. Combinations
of dietary intake, pharmaceutical use and intestinal
microbial production can produce exposures in the
range shown in the figure. This effect is just one of many
potential nutrient depletion scenarios resulting from
chronic toxicant exposure. Table 8.3 summarizes some
known mechanisms of toxic consequences. Multiple reviews are available where such mechanisms are discussed
in detail.9, 37 Some reviewers include special sections on
immunotoxicology.6

Multilayer Toxicant Insults. There is potential for
additive or synergistic effects that may not be addressed
by assays for exposure to single chemicals.28 Multiple
factors can contribute to a detoxification-compromised
individual, such as integrity of their physiological barriers, nutrient sufficiency, use of certain pharmaceuticals,
diet, genetics, length and severity of chronic exposure,
and the presence of disease such as diabetes. Environmental exposures must be considered as incremental
loads on top of potential drug-induced hepato- or nephrotoxicity due to use of pharmaceuticals. For example,
polybrominated biphenyls (PBPs) alter the response of
the kidney to other toxic chemicals, making their insidious effect more hazardous than some direct-acting nephrotoxicants.25 A clinician will rightly suspect total toxin
load as the cause of disease for the patient with intestinal
bacterial overgrowth, long-term use of pharmaceuticals
and a diet of foods with high toxicant concentration
while living in the inner region of a large city. If that patient happens to have genetic weaknesses in one or more
detoxifying pathway enzyme, then the health risks of
inadequate detoxification capacity increase dramatically.

Response to Benzoic Acid Loading38

As benzoic acid dose increases, hippurate formation
rises to a plateau, indicating metabolic saturation
kinetics. Simultaneously, levels of the associated cofactor,
coenzyme A, decline, indicating that the conversion
capacity is exceeded because of coenzyme A limitation.
Supplementation with glycine improves hepatic glycine
availability, and additional pantothenic acid can prevent
such dramatic falls in coenzyme A.
Oxygen Radicals
and Ammonia
The following chapter presents concepts of oxidative challenge due to various radical oxygen species. In
the context of this chapter, it is important to keep in
mind that such challenge to cellular function is a part
of the constant background upon which other potential
toxins play. Thus elevated levels of lipid peroxides or
8-OHdG reveal PUFA and DNA oxidative damage rates
that exceed capacities for neutralizing oxygen radicals.
Another principal part of that background is ammonia
arising from the rhythmic processing of amino acids and
from intestinal bacterial metabolism. Urinary orotate,
citrate, cis-aconitate and isocitrate are markers of the hepatic and renal capacity to deal with ammonia burdens.
Because these matters are of such critical importance
and constant challenge, we might label the assessment of
protection from oxidant and ammonia challenge as the
first order priority for assessment when detoxification

structures have a very large number of sites that tend to
have low affinity but high binding capacity for molecules with polar character.

## Testing Toxin Load

Both toxic metals and small organic molecules
may be measured in body fluids and tissues by various laboratory methods. Because toxic metals can bind
avidly to many tissue proteins, they tend to accumulate
with repeated exposure. Since the half-life of many
metal-binding proteins is relatively slow, testing performed months after the exposure can reveal elevated
tissue levels. Non-polar organotoxins accumulate in
adipose tissue, so long-term exposure assessment may
require a fat biopsy specimen. When blood or urine is
used for organotoxin exposure, the test must be done
shortly after exposure because of rapid clearance rates.
Measurement of exposure to organic toxins is complicated by migration from body fluids to tissue sites
and chemical modifications creating multiple forms of
most compounds.47 The extracellular matrix is a site
to be considered for accumulation. The proteoglycan

## Toxic Heavy Metals
A preliminary discussion of toxic heavy metals
was included in Chapter 3 because elemental screening
profiles of blood, urine or hair frequently include both
essential and toxic metals. Some of the more complex
details of these assessments will be covered here.
Metallothionein is a metal ion binding protein that
is particularly abundant in the kidney where it serves
to sequester essential elements, preventing their spillage into urine. The metallothionein binding sites may
also be occupied by toxic heavy metals. Because each
molecule of metallothionein offers multiple temporary
binding sites, one may think of urinary challenge assessments as ways of determining the level of metallothionein loading with toxic elements. Renal metallothionein
loading status is revealed more dramatically by using appropriate doses of chelating agents such as EDTA, DMSA
or DMPS prior to collecting urine for analysis. These
chelating or complexing agents effectively compete for
the metallothionein binding sites, causing release of
bound toxic elements so that a much larger fraction
spills into urine.

is suspected to play a significant clinical role. This high
order of priority places examination of urinary 8-OHdG
and orotate at the top rank of laboratory evaluations. Correcting abnormalities of these markers may call for more
detailed investigations of contributing toxic exposures.

Mechanism

Notes:

Recent implementation of dietary supplements containing zinc, for example, can cause increases in metallothionein levels.48 Other indirect tests are useful, such as
plasma methionine and taurine or urinary sulfate. These
tests are discussed in the chapters on amino acids and
organic acids.
Mercury exposure is particularly difficult to assess
because of the tendency of mercury to form covalent
bonds with proteins, thus sequestering the mercury
from chelating agents. This behavior is one reason that
methyl mercury accumulates in brain tissue.49 Methyl
mercury-induced excitotoxicity occurs because it preferentially accumulates in astrocytes.50 Because of the
extreme toxicity of methyl mercury and the fact that
measurements of concentrations in blood, urine or hair
show total mercury, devices have been developed for
the direct measurement of mercury vapors in the oral
cavity. Elevated methyl mercury in the mouth is related
to the presence of mercury amalgam dental fillings.51
When significant exposure to heavy metals is known or
suspected for pregnant women, testing of amniotic fluid
may be done to reveal levels of fetal exposure.52 Loss of
productivity in the United States in 2004 is estimated
at $8.7 billion, because of more than 316,588 children

Table 8.4 — Toxin Exposure Testing

Long-term accumulation of toxic heavy metals in
bone is much more difficult to assess. Because of the differential in mobilization rates from soft tissue and bone,
sequential monitoring of body fluid levels frequently
reveals one toxic metal rising as another is normalized.
This effect is due to the redistribution of toxic heavy
metals between soft tissue binding sites, especially
metallothionein, and bone that is a long-term accrual
site with slow turnover. The toxic potential of heavy
metals is exerted because they bind to critical sites on
enzymes, DNA, or transport or regulatory proteins. As
procedures are used to lower metallothionein content
of toxicants, they redistribute from bone or soft tissue
interference sites.
Some clinical researchers have attempted to perform
direct measurements of metallothionein, reasoning
that impaired ability to form the protein will produce
heightened toxic metal susceptibility. The difficulty with
this evaluation is that metallothionein is a highly inducible protein, making a single-point test result difficult
to interpret. A low metallothionein reading may imply
few acute toxic or nutrient metal intake challenges in
the interval of time just before the specimen was taken
rather than a chronic inability to form metallothionein.

each year who are born with cord-blood mercury levels
> 5.8 µg/L. Such levels of mercury are associated with
loss of IQ53 and have been heavily debated as a contributing agent to disorders of the autism spectrum.54–59
The controversy is heightened because it is linked to the
worldwide preventive health procedure of immunization. Widely used forms of injectable immunization
solutions have been preserved with thimerosol (Figure
8.6). Investigative news reports about apparent withholding of adverse information by public organizations
have spurred intense public interest, especially from
parents of autistic children.60

Another approach is to measure urinary levels of
the products of hepatic detoxification that can reveal
the level of sequestered compound still being processed through hepatic pathways long after the initial
exposure. Xylene is one of the most common organic
solvents released into the environment. It occurs in
three isomers that differ in the position of the methyl
groups. Xylene exposure is revealed by measuring the
oxidation/conjugation product 2-methylhippurate.62 The
3- and 4-methylhippurate products can also be measured, but, since they virtually always rise in parallel to
the 2-methyl form, there is no new information to be
gained regarding a patient’s exposure to xylene. Levels
in urine correlated significantly with the time-weighted
average intensity of exposure. Rates of clearance were
lowered in exposed workers who regularly smoke and
consume alcohol due to lowered rates of conversion,
meaning that xylene accumulation in adipose tissue
should be increased.63

Thimerosal is used as a preservative in vaccine solutions

microbial metabolism, preventing bacterial growth. Many
studies have sought to determine whether small doses of
thimerisol administered in vaccines might exert significant
toxic effects in small children.

Measurement of long-term organotoxin exposure
is still challenging, although recent advances in detection may change that. One particularly difficult aspect
of measuring human exposure to organotoxins is that
these toxins are promptly removed from body fluids,
converted to derivatives, and thereafter may be stored
in adipose tissue. Measurement of organotoxins in body
fluids offers information on the individual’s recent acute
exposure only. Fortunately, technological advances offer
promise such as the technique termed metabonomics,
which uses NMR spectroscopy and high-throughput
systems to examine “the impact of genetic modifications
and toxicological interventions on the network of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites found within a cell,
tissue, or organism.” 61

Phthalates
(R and R’ = CnH2n+1; n = 4-15)

Phthalates are esters of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic
acid, where the alcohols that form the ester bonds have
chain lengths from 4 to 15 carbon atoms long. Phthalates are so widely used in the production of plastics,
cosmetics and other convenience items that exposure to
phthalates is universal for all but the most primitive and
remote cultures. The di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ester
(DEHP) is added in varying amounts to certain plastics
to increase their flexibility. Numerous other uses in consumer products consume the worldwide production of,
roughly, a billion pounds of phthalates per year.

kinds of experiments demonstrate that disruption of
estrogen receptor signaling is one mechanism by which
environmental exposure to phthalates can have negative
health consequences.
Regarding markers of exposure, measurements
of urinary phthalates displayed a reasonable degree of
temporal reliability, and the wide concentration range
found indicates that they are appropriate biomarkers for
use in epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures
in relation to health outcomes in children. Table 8.5
provides some reference for mean concentrations and
distributions in one urban population.69 Urinary mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were
found to be sensitive biomarkers of DEHP exposure.
Their presence in 62 individuals at levels 4-fold higher
than the parent xenobiotic indicates that human DEHP
metabolism involves hydrolysis of 1 ester bond, giving
MEHP, followed by oxidation to MEOHP and MEHHP.70
The US Environmental Protection Agency publishes
regular updates of their surveys of human phthalate exposures and potential chronic health effects and carcinogenicity assessment for lifetime exposure.71-73 Data from
the 1999 and 2001 surveys are shown in Figure 8.7.

Phthalates have been shown to have numerous
physiological effects, mainly related to steroid hormone disruptions such as prenatal phthalate exposure,
causing impaired male reproductive development,64
and endometriosis.65 Although studies on individual
xenoestrogens have found them to be of low estrogenic
potency, when multiple compounds are present at their
no-observed-effect concentrations (NOEC), dramatic
enhancement of estrogen receptor alpha response to
estradiol was found.66 Such results demonstrate the
additive effects of multiple exposures. Phthalate diesters with –CH2– chains ranging in length from 3 to 6
carbon atoms exhibit human estrogen receptor alphamediated estrogenic activity and estrogen receptor betamediated antiestrogenic activity in a dose-dependent
manner.67 Obese, insulin-resistant adult males excrete
higher amounts of mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP),
mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP),
mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) and
mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) than controls. Multiple

Figure 8.7 — 90th Percentile MEHP Levels
These data from the US population aged 6 years and older were collected in 1999 and 2002 by the US National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.71 The 90th percentile values with 95% confidence interval bars show MEHP
concentrations by age, gender and ethnic background. Increasing levels of exposure are seen by comparing the 1999 (T1)
levels with those in 2002 (T2). The overall total levels rose by about 90% in the 3-year interval. Only children 6 to 11 years
old showed no increase, but they had much higher and more highly variable MEHP levels, even in 1999, than any other
age group.

Products of Glycation
or Lipoxidation
Glucose can react non-enzymatically with amino
groups of proteins to yield adducts (known as Maillard
reaction products) that spontaneously and irreversibly
degrade to form compounds called advanced glycation
end products (AGEs). These reactions may take place
in food preparation, especially bread baking, and the
same reaction is a part of normal biological aging, where
tissue proteins are altered by glucose. Rates of formation
of AGEs increase in diabetes due to hyperglycemia and
in renal failure due to high levels of reactive carbonyl
compounds (RCOs). Accumulation of AGEs contributes
to uremic toxicity.74 Through other irreversible reactions
starting with lipid oxidation, lipoxidation end products
(ALEs) also may be formed. Together, these metabolic
end products represent a special class of toxicological
challenge that can cause vascular stiffening75 and contribute to oxidant stress and cytokine stimulation to produce
inflammatory responses, especially in diabetic patients.76
Some success has been reported for synthetic
AGE-breaking compounds.77, 78 These drugs, however, may present further risk of toxicity.79 Prevention

by normalizing plasma glucose and RCO levels is the
obviously preferred patient management approach. The
physiological effects of AGEs are mediated through their
interaction with cell receptors (RAGE), and serum levels
of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) are commercially available to
measure AGE exposure.80

Testing Toxin Effects
## Urinary Porphyrin Profiling
Heme is required at the active sites of oxygen-binding, oxygen-utilizing and oxidizing systems, hemoglobin
(and myoglobin), cytochromes, and mitochondrial electron carriers. Heme is a macrocyclic, iron-sequestering
molecule that is synthesized in most human tissues (predominantly liver and bone marrow) by a pathway with
intermediates called porphyrinogens. The final phase of
metal incorporation inserts iron, cobalt or magnesium
into the protoporphyrin ring to produce heme, cobalamin and, in plants, chlorophyll, respectively. These complex organometallic structures are sometimes called the

pigments of life.81 Porphyrins are oxidized by-products
that have escaped from the pathway. The spilling of
porphyrins into urine generates porphyrinurias. For
example, iron deficiency causes a blockage near the end
of the pathway where iron is incorporated resulting in
elevated levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) and
serum zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP or ZP).
The porphyrin pathway involves eight enzymes in
a sequence beginning and ending in the mitochondria,
with four steps occuring in the cytosol. Glycine and
succinyl-CoA are joined in the initial reaction of the
sequence, producing delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA).
The porphyrin ring is formed in subsequent steps
(Figure 8.8). Restriction of an enzyme activity following
uroporphyrinogen creation produces backup of one or
more porphyrinogens that leads to a rise of the corresponding porphyrins in urine, called porphyrinuria. The
term porphyria may be reserved for primary conditions
exhibiting specific clinical symptoms caused by an
inherited defect in one or more of the heme biosynthetic
enzymes.82 Porphyrinopathy is an umbrella term for any
disorder in porphyrin metabolism. The abbreviations
shown in Table 8.6 may be used for brevity.

## Inherited Enzyme Defects
The utility of urinary porphyrins as a diagnostic
tool is not new—its use has been documented in the
medical literature since 1934, and review articles summarize the genetic and molecular aspects of the various
clinical manifestations that are listed in Table 8.7.83, 84
Porphyrias, which can be inherited or acquired, are often diagnosed with the aid of information regarding the
distribution profile of individual porphyrin intermediates in urine.85 Porphyrins are particularly well suited as
biomarkers for two reasons. First, the pathway is highly
active, so any disturbance tends to cause rapid and

relatively large accumulations of intermediates. Second,
the enzymes of the porphyrin-producing pathway are
widely distributed in human tissues and some of them
are highly sensitive to the presence of various toxins.
Up-regulation of the heme biosynthetic pathway is
another mechanism by which porphyria can be precipitated. Table 8.9 summarizes various conditions that
generate porphyria by altering the overall activity of the
pathway. Elevations from these factors can be mistaken
for genetic or toxicant-mediated porphyria. Calculation
of ratios of key intermediates like precoproporphyrin to
uroporphyrinogen can identify the presence of specific
inhibitions caused by toxicants while minimizing possible
effects of creatinine variability when overnight urine is
utilized. Increases in the ratio indicate true abnormal intermediate accumulation independent of overall pathway
fluctuations. Active porphyria occurs when ALA overproduction coincides with inhibition of one or more of the
porphyrin pathway enzymes (Table 8.8). In other words,
the blockage is apparent as elevations of specific intermediates relative to others when the pathway is accelerated.
It is estimated that among cases of inherited porphyrinogenic enzyme deficiencies, as many as 90% are healthy

Figure 8.8 — Porphyrin Intermediates in Heme Biosynthesis
Heme synthesis starts and ends in the mitochondrial matrix, but the ring-forming and decarboxylation steps are performed by
cytosolic enzymes. Ring closure of hydroxymethylbilane produces a macrocycle with 20 carbon atoms and 4 nitrogen atoms.
Eight carboxylic acid groups extend from the macrocyclic ring of uroporphyrinogens I and III that differ only in the positions
of one pair of acetate and propionate groups. Stepwise decarboxylations produce compounds with 7, 6, 5 or 4 acid groups,
causing a large change in polarity that prepares the ring for resting in the binding sites of heme proteins. Ultimately, insertion
of iron results in a stable, organometallic structure that participates in metabolism as coenzymes and oxygen carriers. The
decarboxylase enzymes are points of toxin interference in the pathway. Heme is exported from mitochondria for incorporation
into cellular hemoproteins. As free heme levels increase, feedback regulation on 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase occurs,
particularly in liver, slowing down the flow of products.

Environmental Toxicant Effects
Porphyrins measured in urine serve as biomarkers
of toxin effects. Toxic chemicals can affect human biochemistry at any level of exposure. Fortunately, the body
has mechanisms for transforming, eliminating or compartmentalizing the many toxic chemicals encountered
over a lifetime. Nonetheless, these “safety” mechanisms
may be inadequate in the modern industrialized society,
especially for susceptible people such as the elderly,
children, individuals with poor nutritional habits, and
others who are physiologically stressed.87, 88 Recognizing
and identifying offending chemicals can present a difficult challenge for the clinician. Many chemicals exert
their effect at such low concentrations that they escape
direct detection except by very sophisticated laboratory
methods. Compartmentalization in tissues, especially
brain, that are difficult to access makes routine direct
concentration measurements impractical. Elevated
porphyrins in urine serve as biomarkers to verify the
clinical observations of symptomatic effects of toxicity.
Current analytical advances make routine profiling of
the multiple intermediates a powerful tool for assessing
toxic effects of heavy metals and some xenobiotics.
Details of the decarboxylation steps in heme
biosynthesis are shown in Figure 8.9. Porphyrinogens (precursors to porphyrins) are easily oxidized to
porphyrins by non-enzymatic metal catalysts. However,
enzyme-specific effects result from binding of toxins to
specific sites on the enzymes that carry out the porphyrin biosynthesis. In rats, chronic low-level exposure
to methyl mercury was associated with characteristic
urinary porphyrin changes. These included highly

Figure 8.9 — Toxic Metal Interferences in Porphyrin Pathway Decarboxylation Reactions
The normal heme-forming pathway involves six decarboxylation steps, four of which are carried out by a single enzyme,
uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). Binding of toxicants causes the creation of an altered binding site that causes
slowing of the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to protoproporphyrin IV. Accumulating pentacarboxyporphyrinogen
due to mercury poisoning may be acted on by coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX), yielding the abnormal product
ketoisocoproporphyrinogen that is thought to account for the chromatographic peak called precoproporphyrin. Carboxyl
groups are shaded yellow and the groups that are cleaved by UROD and CPOX are shaded purple and green, respectively.

Figure 8.10 — Urinary Porphyrin Changes with

Consecutive DMPS Injections83

In mercury-exposed rats, urinary levels of penta, precopro
and coproporphyrin are elevated. The data shown
in
reveal how kidney levels of these porphyrins are
lowered with removal of mercury by 3 consecutive
DMPS injections (100 mg/kg, IP) at 72-hour intervals.
The porphyrin levels are displayed as a percentage of
pre-chelation saline injection concentrations. *Indicates
a significantly different result (p < 0.05). Based on such
data from animal and human studies, the hypothetical
relationship depicted in
was proposed. The presence
of mercury produces elevated porphyrin levels and
its removal is indirectly related to lowering of the
characteristic porphyrinuria.
mercury.90 Urinary porphyrin profiles were also shown
to correlate significantly with mercury body burden
and with specific neurobehavioral deficits associated with low-level (mean levels of 36 µg/L) mercury
exposure.91 Urinary mercury levels greater than 20 µg/mL
produced urinary porphyrin elevations (esp. precoproporphyrin) comparable to those found in rats with specific low-level mercury exposure.90, 92 Ongoing validation
studies of dental practitioners with low-level occupational mercury exposure have continued to demonstrate
the predicted urinary porphyrin profile change (elevated
urinary Penta, Precopro and Copro) among subjects.92
A final fulfillment of proof that the porphyria is not
only characteristic of mercury exposure but, in fact, also
caused by the toxic effects of mercury has come by demonstration of sequential induction and removal of porphyrinuria by exposure followed by mobilization with
the metal chelator DMPS.93 The data from this study are
reproduced in Figure 8.10. Evidence for the preferential
elevation of penta- and precopro by mercury is summarized in Table 8.10. Detecting the pattern unique to
mercury requires measurement of precoproporphyrin.
Since the conversion of uroporphyrinogen to
coproporphyrinogen III involves four decarboxylation
reactions catalyzed by the same enzyme, it is initially
curious that toxins affect only the fourth reaction. The
explanation seems to lie in the fact that uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is a complex dimeric protein containing two active sites. The dimeric structure allows for
alteration as carboxyl group removal decreases substrate
polarity.94 This allows the rationale for slowing of the
final decarboxylation of Penta by toxins without affecting the previous three decarboxylations.95 Thus the
distinctive pattern of mercury poisoning can appear in
porphyrin profiles. Laboratory analysis of urine from a
mercury-toxic patient by high-performance liquid chromatography shows an abnormal compound that is called
precoproporphyrin because it emerges shortly ahead of
coproporphyrin. This compound is thought to be the
ketoisocoproporphyrin by-product shown as the corresponding porphyrinogen in Figure 8.9, although no

definitive structural confirmation studies are available
at the time of writing this book. The enzyme inhibition
caused by mercury results in accumulation of pentacarboxyporphyrin that is oxidized by CPOX to form the
abnormal porphryrin called precoproporphyrin and
thought to be ketoisocoproporhyrin. The mechanism for
toxic metal interference is thought to involve active site
discrimination on the uroporporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme as illustrated in Figure 8.11.89
A recent finding of heme transporters that regulate
movement of Copro III into the mitochondria offers an
alternative point of toxic interference to explain the high
Copro III associated with mercury exposure.96 Inhibition
of the transporter would tend to raise levels of Copro III
and precursors. Evidence for the preferential elevation
of Copro I relative to Copro III by arsenic is summarized
in Table 8.11. Measuring both Copro III and I rather
than total coproporphyrins allows the detection of this
perturbation. This perturbation points to involvement of
uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase because the elevation of
Copro I over III indicates a block in the formation rather
than the disposition of Copro III. Such a block would
cause more spilling of Uro into the non-productive pathway to Copro I.
Chronic exposure to toxic metals, including lead,
mercury, arsenic, aluminum and cadmium often results
in organ-specific accumulation that compromises targetorgan physiology. Heavy metals damage many aspects of
metabolism. Similarly, chronic exposure to organic chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, and industrial and
manufacturing by-products can have deleterious impact
on the body’s biochemistry, which results in the decline of

Table 8.12 provides a summary of the most common
patterns associated with specific environmental toxins.

## Clinical Applications
Attacks of neuropsychiatric symptoms that occur in acute porphyrias may be due to a toxic surplus
of 5-aminolevulinic acid or deficiency of vital hemoproteins resulting from impaired synthesis of heme.
Accumulation of phototoxic porphyrins produces the
solar hypersensitivity found in cutaneous porphyrias.81
In this condition, the most affected heme precursors
are frequently found at levels more than severalfold
greater than laboratory upper limits during symptomatic porphyrias. Milder presentations are found in most
environmental toxin-induced porphyrinurias. It has
been suggested that chronic, mild porphyria may be an
etiologic factor in multiple chemical sensitivities, Persian
Gulf War syndrome, chronic fatigue and conditions associated with silicone breast implants, although direct
evidence for such causation is lacking.115
Mounting evidence implicates mercury as a specific
risk factor for regressive autism.55 Arguments for potential interactions such as interference with the function of
methionine synthase in the brain have been proposed.116
However, mercury exposure levels from thimerosal-preserved immunizations or maternal transfer are relatively low, making demonstration of metabolic toxicity
difficult. Examination of patterns for urinary excretion
of Penta, Precopro and Copro has revealed significantly
higher occurrences in autistic children compared with
controls.103 These results have been confirmed in a second study using data from a separate laboratory.104 Such
studies give evidence implicating mercury as a contributing factor in regressive autism and related childhood

developmental disorders. The finding of porphyrinuria
indicative of the mercury effect in an autistic child, especially when verified by direct measurement of mercury,
is evidence justifying further clinical action to reduce
body burden of mercury.
Changes in the urinary porphyrins (i.e., porphyrinuria) coincident with provocation (e.g., fasting) or
therapeutic intervention (e.g., medications, chelation
therapy) are suggestive of some type of porphyrinopathy.
Latent PCT is frequently activated by such metabolic
challenges. If the patient’s response upon provocation
can be duplicated, then the possibility of a diagnosis
of porphyria should be investigated. Urinary porphyrin elevations of three or more times the upper limit
of the reference range as found in inherited metabolic
acute porphyrins may indicate that organ accumulation
of porphyrins is reaching pathological levels.208, 209 In
such cases, a comprehensive genetic porphyria workup and toxin body burden testing is warranted. For
out-of-range results that are lower than three times the
upper limit, the rationale for further porphyria testing
is predicated on the availability of corroborating clinical

and/or biochemical data such as complaints, family and
patient medical history. Female sex hormone use can
raise levels,117 and consumption of brewer’s yeast has
been reported to cause a pseudoporphyria.118 Drugs
that can affect test measurements include aminosalicylic
acid, birth control pills, barbiturates, chloral hydrate,
chlorpropamide, ethyl alcohol, griseofulvin, morphine,
phenazopyridine, procaine, and sulfonamides.119 A
more extensive list is shown in Table 8.13.
Figure 8.12 represents some of the multiple genetic,
nutritional and toxicant influences on the porphyrin
biosynthesis and degradation pathways. In patients
with multiple exposures and compromised nutrient
status, the pattern of porphyrinuria may not allow
exclusive assignment of single toxicant effects because
of overlapping interferences. Use of porphyrin tests as
biomarkers of chemical toxicity is useful in combination with other laboratory tests (e.g., blood, urine or
hair analysis in cases of suspected metal toxicity). The
clinician should realize that there are many conditions
unrelated to primary or toxicant-induced porphyria that
can cause porphyrinuria. When considering a urinary
porphyrin result, the clinician should be mindful that
the distribution of normal urinary porphyrin values,
representing healthy individuals, overlaps significantly
with values representing those who have suffered from
porphyria at one time or another. An observed porphyria may be the result of a chemical insult to a pathway
enzyme combined with a stressor like iron deficiency
that modifies heme pathway activity.95
Patients testing mildly positive on the urinary
porphyrins test should be followed up with more
specific testing such as toxic element testing of chelation-challenged urine for a differential diagnosis. Tests
that assay toxic metals directly in biological samples are

Figure 8.12 — Interferences in the Pathway for

Heme Formation and Degradation

From the initial reactions of the biosynthetic pathway to
the final steps of elimination, the intense activity to form
and clear heme presents numerous opportunities for
interferences due to toxins, nutrient deficiency, genetic
weaknesses or iatrogenic interventions. The intermediates
that pass into urine can serve as markers of exposure to
environmental toxins, whereas those that accumulate
can become endotoxins. When the sum of interferences
slows the rate of heme production below that required
to maintain total-body oxygen transport, anemia results,
and free iron oxidative challenge may occur. When the
degradation reactions or secretory systems are blocked,
failure of clearance can cause symptoms due to drug
overdosing or maldigestion.
essential for confirming whether the toxicity symptoms
are caused by a metal. When a significant toxic element
metabolic impact is seen in the porphyrin pathway,
other functional tests may show abnormalities related to
the metabolic perturbations of the toxicant on metabolic
pathways governed by enzymes sensitive to toxic effects
of the element. For example, oxidative stress markers
may show elevations of citric acid cycle enzymes,120 or
electron transport system proteins may be affected.121, 122

Detoxification Mechanisms
Mechanisms that protect human tissues from
toxicity include barriers to penetration, mobilization and
excretion. Metabolic biotransformation produces more
easily removed chemical derivatives via gastrointestinal
tract, kidney, skin and lungs. Metabolism of toxicants can
occur in two phases. Phase I is an oxidation step that converts molecules into substrates for the Phase II enzymes.
For many compounds, only one of these two phases
is required. For example, normal doses of acetaminophen can be cleared by utilizing the combination of
Phase II sulfation and glucuronidation pathways. At
sufficiently high intake, these pathways fail to prevent
Phase I oxidation reactions that yield reactive acetaminophen metabolites that then require glutathione
conjugation (see Figure 8.13). At still higher intake, the
accumulation of highly reactive quinone metabolites
produces oxidative stress and non-specific reactions with
structural proteins and enzymes. Such alterations are a
type of metabolic poisoning of enzymes because they are
removed from participation in normal metabolism.
From the perspective of evaluating individual total
detoxification ability, the classes of enzymes involved
may be summarized as shown in Table 8.14. The Phase I
and II biotransformation systems that are frequently
discussed with regard to clearance of xenobiotic and
pharmaceutical compounds are an important part
of this set.
Endogenous toxins and exogenous diet-derived or
pharmacological compounds are converted to more water-soluble forms by enzymatic action (primarily hepatic)
in order to have their toxic potential removed. Although
detoxification pathways will act on a very wide variety of
chemicals, they do not neutralize all foreign compounds.
Highly toxic organic mercury and organic phosphorus
compounds owe their great potency to the fact that they

are highly reactive and unaffected by the detoxification
enzymes of the liver. However, the luminal transport of
mercury is greatly attenuated when L-cystine, L-serine,
L-histidine and L-tryptophan are present, showing how
amino acid therapy might reduce the effects of mercury
exposure.123 Cyanide binds so rapidly and strongly to
hemoglobin that it also avoids all mechanisms for neutralization and excretion.
The finding that combination dosing with alphaketoglutarate and sodium thiosulfate produces a 70% increase in survival of mice exposed to cyanide is another
demonstration of how amino acids (that can generate
a-KG and sulfur amino acids) can protect against toxic
effects.124 Hepatic detoxification capacity testing does
not evaluate how organic mercury and phosphorus and
cyanide are controlled.
Detoxification encompasses mechanisms that enhance tolerance, induce mobilization, increase metabolic
conversion rates and induce excretion of toxins. Each of

these mechanisms may be addressed by clinical interventions, and each is amenable, in various degrees, to
laboratory evaluation. For adverse health consequences
from chronic low-level exposures, tolerance is the central issue. Since a toxin-free environment is unrealistic,
the enhancement and maintenance of normal detoxification mechanisms through lifestyle modification and use
of nutrients is essential. The clinical question is when to
use any of the various interventions that are available.
Notes:

Answers to this question are provided by laboratory
evaluations of toxin exposure, total-body toxic burden
and detoxification capacities (Table 8.1).
For a full picture of a patient’s response to toxins,
it is important to assess (1) normal exposure tolerance
and (2) the ability to handle unusual episodes of high
exposure. Some toxins accumulate in the body over the
course of weeks (or longer) after environmental exposures and the ingestion and processing of food. Other
toxins accrue from short-term acute exposures that can
vary over intervals of a few seconds to several hours.
Episodes of high exposure occur in some occupations
such as the life-threatening topical exposure to methyl
mercury solutions, a risk, for example, in some research
laboratory environments. Cumulative effects can result
from home use of solvents or insecticides.125 An important example of endogenous toxin production is the random oxidation effects of radical oxygen species (ROS).
These damaging compounds are produced as a result of
the energy-yielding oxidative pathways in every human
cell.126 Since this is a special form of toxin exposure, the
topic of oxidant damage and antioxidant status has been
reserved for Chapter 9, “Oxidant Stress.”
Another source of chronic exposure requiring
detoxification capacity is the flow of compounds from
microbial actions on food residues in the gut. This
phenomenon is most active in the small intestine as
discussed in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” This source
may be considered either normal, chronic background
exposure or episodic, acute exposure, depending on
the extent of microbial overgrowth and the integrity of
the physical barrier. Evaluations of total toxin exposure
should always include testing for elevated flow of toxic
microbial products formed in the gut.
Notes:
Clinical Laboratory
Assessments of
Detoxification
Diagnosis of the toxic patient relies on proper use
of clinical laboratory data linked with a medical history
that can reveal episodes of exogenous toxicant exposure.
Some measures show metabolic effects of impaired detoxification systems, whereas others show the presence
of the toxicant by direct measurement.

Toxicant Indications from
Standard Serum Chemistry Profiles
Urea in serum, commonly known as blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), is the normal non-toxic (or one might
say “detoxified”) form of ammonia, so elevated BUN is
a sign of increased ammonia loading and conversion by
the urea cycle. A high value is expected to be found in
patients where urinary orotate is elevated because that
marker appears when ammonia loading exceeds urea
cycle capacity for conversion into urea. This relationship
may not be found in patients with genetic defects in urea
cycle enzymes, preventing normal rates of reaction. See
Chapter 4, “Amino Acids,” for more detailed description
of the urea cycle enzymes.
Ammonia assays may be added to profiles of serum
chemistries for a direct assessment of ammonemia.
When such results are used in tandem with functional
markers found in urine organic acid profiles, it is valuable to keep in mind the relatively transient nature of
ammonia due to the multiple mechanisms dynamically
linked for ensuring optimal removal following episodes
of exposure. Thus lack of correlation may be due to differences in timing of specimen collection. The tests can
reveal progressive states of mild, episodic ammonemia
to the dangerously severe, chronic state as outlined in
Table 8.15. Profound chronic elevations of serum ammonia are a cardinal sign of late-stage liver failure with
immediate, life-threatening effects known as hepatic
encephalopathy.
Bilirubin elevation due to impaired glucuronidation
is discussed in Case Illustration 8.1, where mild Gilbert’s
syndrome was apparently a part of specific diet-related
symptoms. The well-known effects reported for severe
Gilbert’s cases illustrates the toxicity of the normal hemoglobin product, bilirubin. A patient with even mildly
elevated serum bilirubin is immediately among those
where therapeutic drug monitoring is important because

of the likelihood that drug half-lives are significantly
extended. For example, acetaminophen glucuronide
formation was found to be 31% lower in subjects with
Gilbert’s syndrome than that in normal controls.127 In
this particular instance, the mild forms of the inherited
disorder can confer a favorable metabolic protection.
Serum bilirubin can function as an antioxidant and
inhibit hydroperoxide formation and alpha-tocopherol
consumption, resulting in plasma lipids being protected
from peroxidation.128 Rising bilirubin levels in patients
without Gilbert’s syndrome can signal liver disease that
has obvious ramifications for detoxification functions.
Refer to Case Illustration 8.1

Creatinine measured concurrently in serum and
urine can be used to calculate creatinine clearance for
assessment of kidney damage. Increased serum creatinine can indicate kidney damage due to autoimmune
diseases, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis or complications of diabetes. In any event the loss of kidney
function is a major consideration for evaluating toxicant
effects due to the loss of a major removal route.

## Urinary Markers of Detoxification
Compounds present in unchallenged overnight
urine reveal aspects of xenobiotic exposure, endogenous
toxin handling and detoxification functions. Unchallenged urinary markers are summarized in Table 8.1,
and they were described in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.”
Data from an unchallenged urine specimen cannot show
capacities for toxin removal. However, such testing does
allow simultaneous examination of the levels of intestinal microbial toxins and markers for hepatic conjugation
substrate adequacy. For example, a patient with elevated
p-cresol and pyroglutamate has both a high exposure

level (elevated p-cresol) and a low detoxification capacity (elevated pyroglutamate). Elevated pyroglutamate
indicates specific depletion of glutathione, which takes
on special significance when intestinal bacteria are causing increased release of toxic products.
Urinary markers of dysbiosis should be examined
carefully in cases of chronic fatigue because signs of
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth signal increased
transient ammonia loading, which may cause symptoms
of lethargy. Intestinal bacteria can contribute significantly to the total load of ammonia,129 and the level of
contribution is affected by dietary composition.130, 131
Exercise also causes a rise in blood ammonia, especially
if glucose availability is impaired.132 Ammonia and other
endotoxins as well as environmental toxin loading are
factors that can contribute to chronic fatigue.133-135
Ammonia is toxic to the central nervous system,
and the amount of ammonia produced each day by a
healthy individual exceeds the CNS toxic limit by several
orders of magnitude. Since even transient elevations
of blood ammonia can lead to lapses in mental ability
and sensation of muscle fatigue,136 evidence of poor
ammonia clearance from blood provides valuable
insight into clinical presentation and treatment. The
largest routine source of ammonia is dietary protein
because the majority of the amine groups are converted
into ammonia. Because it carries two amine groups,
glutamine is particularly known to challenge the
ammonia-clearing pathways.137
Ammonia is normally cleared by the reactions of
the urea cycle. This pathway is highly energy (ATP)
demanding and dependent on adequate concentrations
of arginine and aspartic and glutamic acids.138 The most
critical of these is arginine. Elevated urinary citrate and
orotate are signs of ammonia loading and poor ammonia
clearance due to arginine insufficiency, respectively.139
Supplemental alpha-ketoglutaric acid is also useful for
lowering ammonia levels in blood.140, 141
Potential toxicants like acetaminophen that require
sulfation for clearance cause lowering of serum and
urinary sulfate and depletion of total-body sulfur amino
acids.142 Intake of sulfur-rich proteins or sulfur-containing
amino acids like methionine or N-acetylcysteine raise
available organic sulfur and restore sulfate levels.143, 144
A patient with both high toxicant exposure and oxidative challenge can quickly have total demand for sulfur
amino acids and glutathione reach levels that stress rates
of supply from dietary sources. Normal sulfate excretion

is approximately 25 millimoles in 24 hours, so sulfate
reserves must be maintained by intake of sulfur-containing amino acids.145 Sodium sulfate dosing helps by
sparing the demand for organic sulfur compounds to
enter pathways for conversion to sulfate.

Testing for Hepatic
Detoxification Capacity
The human liver contains several different types of
cells that are organized into microscopic arrays called
“lobules.” Each cell can perform hundreds of different biochemical reactions. In addition, the biochemical activity of each cell depends on its interaction with
other cells and with the extracellular matrix. Testing for
detoxification capacity can reveal the status of specific
functions in these cells.
Any history of hepatic inflammatory disorder is
evidence that overall organ reserve is low and that
hepatic functions may be globally depressed.146 Such
incidents include infections caused by virus, bacteria

or parasites (hepatitis, tuberculosis and amoebic liver
disease, respectively); drugs (prescription and abused);
toxins (DDT or carbon tetrachloride); and excess alcohol intake. Acute toxic exposures can lead to hepatic
necrosis and elevated levels of the serum enzymes,
alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase
(AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and creatine
phosphokinase (CPK). Concurrent rises in GGT, AST
and ALT on follow-up testing identifies alcoholic men
under treatment who have resumed drinking.147 Low
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) signals hepatic failure and
increased risk of critical ammonemic sequelae.148 Such
findings signal general hepatic functional impairment
but are not necessarily related to toxin exposure.
Exposure to volatile petrochemical substances in
the workplace causes elevated GGT, implying toxic
liver degeneration.149 Aspartic acid may help to protect
against toxic liver damage.150

serial fashion so that the product of the first phase becomes the substrate of the second. The difference from
the sequence of reactions for the pathways of energy and
biosynthetic metabolism is that the enzymes can react
with multiple types of compounds, producing overlap
in the potential fates of a given toxicant. In Phase I,
new chemical groups are introduced to substrates.151
Although this phase is sometimes described as “oxidation,” groups are introduced by oxidation and reduction
as well as several other types of reactions as outlined in
Table 8.14. In Phase II (sometimes called conjugation),
additional groups that confer greater water solubility are
introduced so that the products can be transported from
enterocytes or hepatocytes. In the liver, the products
enter either the biliary system or the blood, from which
they may be removed by the kidneys and excreted in
urine. Efficient clearance of a given compound may
require only Phase I or Phase II type reactions or both.
Tables 8.16, 8.17 and 8.18 summarize information
about the compounds that stimulate the P450 emzymes
system and compounds that are acted on by P450 and
conjugating enzymes, respectively.
Comprehensive testing for capacities in all areas
of hepatic detoxification is not yet widely available.
However, tests that show activities in the major enzyme
systems can give valuable clinical insight regarding
how patients respond to toxin loads. For investigations
of specific toxicant clearance capacities, the challenge
compounds must be non-toxic at the levels used and
must require the same pathway as the class of toxins
under evaluation. The common, non-prescription
drugs caffeine, acetaminophen and salicylic acid
undergo well-defined hepatic detoxification pathways
(Figure 8.13). Detoxification capacity may be evaluated

by administering these compounds at a sufficiently high
dose to challenge the pathways used for their detoxification. Because caffeine, acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic
acid are readily available and well tolerated by most
individuals, they are suitable for such use. Quantitative
analysis of clearance rates or urinary products of the
detoxification reactions provides evidence of detoxification capacities of those enzymes for processing other
toxins. Antioxidant protection status may be assessed in
the same procedure. For example, free radical attack on
salicylic acid is revealed by measuring the percentage of
salycilate converted to urinary 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate.152
In this detoxification process, products of the first
phase of detoxification can be much more toxic than the
original compound. This means that any impairment
in a subsequent conjugation step can lead to accumulation of the more highly toxic intermediate. The reactive metabolites may form covalent bonds with various
macromolecular cell components. Modified cell regulatory sites can lead to cell injury, whereas DNA modification can be carcinogenic. For example, the analgesic
acetaminophen is a leading cause of toxic drug overdose
because of its toxic quinone metabolite that causes

## Phase I Testing by Caffeine Clearance
The ability to clear a challenge dose of caffeine is
an indicator of the detoxification capacity of the hepatic
Phase I pathway through cytochrome P450 (CYP450).
The enzyme system called microsomal P450 mixedfunction oxidase is used to oxidize such compounds to
prepare them for removal. Its activity toward all similar

molecules is reflected by how fast caffeine is removed
from the body. After an oral challenge dose of 200 mg
caffeine, saliva samples are taken at intervals of two and
eight hours. The saliva is analyzed for caffeine, the concentration of which closely parallels that in blood.154,155
This test evaluates only the isoforms of CYP450 that act
on molecules with structure similar to caffeine. Many
other CYP450 isoforms are required for oxidation of
other classes of toxicants.
It is important to evaluate the CYP450 enzymes
because they handle such a wide variety of toxins. They

have a limited capacity, and there is great individual variability in rates of expression of the genes. The CYP450
step tends to be rate limiting for overall toxicant clearance because the rate at which they process substrates is
very slow relative to most other enzymes—only about
one molecule per enzyme per minute is transformed.156
If Caffeine Clearance Is HIGH: A high value signifies that the liver is very actively removing caffeine and
similar compounds using the microsomal P450 enzyme.
When this activity is elevated, it is especially important
to minimize exposure to environmental toxins such as
car exhausts, food contaminants and pesticides since the
P450 enzyme can convert such substances into more
toxic compounds, many of which are pro-carcinogenic.
As exposure decreases, enzyme activity should decline.
Smokers and those who maintain a high-protein diet
will usually demonstrate a higher caffeine clearance
due to continuous induction of this enzyme system,
although the several subtypes of P450 enzymes are specifically induced by the compounds on which they act.
This means that caffeine clearance may be unaffected by
induction of the P450-1A1 class by supplementation of
I3C as is commonly done to increase the rate of 2-hydroxyestrone formation (see Chapter 10).
Gut microbes are capable of generating many toxins
that must be degraded by the P450 enzyme system. If an
imbalance exists between the beneficial and pathogenic
bacteria, increased levels of toxic compounds can be absorbed through the gut wall. See Chapter 7, “GI Function,”
for routines to restore intestinal microbial balance.
The P450 enzyme system causes chemical oxidation, wherein dangerous free radical compounds are
formed. The level of protection from the destructive
effects of such products depends largely on intake of
antioxidant nutrients. Therefore, supplementation of the
antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, zinc, selenium and lipoic acid may be helpful (see
Chapter 10) to support hepatic Phase I detoxification.
If Clearance Rate Is LOW: For an individual
with average food intake and environmental exposure,
a low caffeine clearance rate indicates genetic polymorphism or loss of liver function. Examples of conditions
leading to such loss are infectious liver diseases and
alcoholic cirrhosis.157
A low result indicates that the processing and degradation of foreign compounds is slower than normal.
Since most xenobiotic toxicants are non-polar, they will
tend to accumulate in adipose tissue because they are

not cleared from blood. Effects are typically seen in the
central nervous system and in higher rates of neuromuscular function degeneration.
The P450 enzymes are an inducible, on-demand
detoxification system. If there has been low exposure
to environmental inducers, a low value may simply
indicate a low exposure. For most individuals, however,
it is important to decrease toxic exposure and increase
the enzyme activity. Supplementation with high-quality protein, iron, riboflavin and ascorbic acid may be
considered, along with routines to stimulate detoxification through the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Once
P450 enzyme production has increased, activity rates
depend on the availability of magnesium and niacin (for
NADPH synthesis).156

## Phase II Testing
Benzoic Acid Clearance: Figure 8.5 shows how
benzoic acid loading of humans can deplete glycine, the
conjugation substrate, and coenzyme A, the cofactor
required for glycine conjugation. The very real potential
for some patients being in a state of glycine and pantothenic acid insufficiency is shown by these results and
others where urinary pyroglutamate is found to rise as
glycine insufficiency develops.158 Because glycine is one
of the three amino acids used to form glutathione, insufficiency of glycine may be associated with total-body
glutathione depletion. Exposure to pentachlorophenol
(PCP), a pesticide used industrially as a wood preservative for utility poles, railroad ties and wharf pilings can
induce a 60% reduction in glutathione content in mouse
tissue, explaining the cytotoxic and genotoxic properties
of PCP.159
Notes:

Acetaminophen Conversion: A 650 mg dose of
acetaminophen taken in the evening is converted to
various conjugation products overnight, and the levels
in the overnight urine reflect the activities of conjugation enzymes. Pathways utilizing glutathione, glucuronic
acid or sulfate produce the mercapturate, glucuronate or
sulfate conjugates, respectively, of acetaminophen (Figure 8.13). The drug is initially oxidized to the reactive
metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NABQI),
which is highly toxic and must be removed by conjugation with mercapturic acid via glutathione activation.160
Pathways utilizing sulfur compounds in detoxification
are illustrated in Figure 8.14.
The activity of enzymes that carry out sulfation of
acetaminophen can be limited because of limited availability of the active sulfate donor, 3'-phosphoadenosine
5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). The supply of PAPS is, in
turn, limited by the availability of its precursor, inorganic sulfate. Administration of sodium sulfate and
the sulfate precursor N-acetylcysteine can enhance the
formation of acetaminophen sulfate.161 A test result
showing a low percent conversion into acetaminophen
sulfate means that the patient has reduced capacity to
remove toxic compounds requiring sulfation. Long-term
accumulation of the initial toxicants or the intermediate oxidation products can produce widely varying
symptoms.
Patients highly susceptible to environmental illness have diminished capacity to form acetaminophen
sulfate.162 A lowered capacity for xenobiotic metabolism,
especially of compounds containing sulfur, is a major
risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease.163
In ruminants, sulfate metabolism is impaired by excessive dietary molybdenum.164
Obese patients may show glucuronide values above
normal because obesity is associated with enhanced
capacity for biotransformation of drugs via glucuronide
conjugation. Conjugating capacity by this mechanism
increases in proportion to total body weight and is consistent among drugs.165 Cigarette smoking is more likely
to induce drug oxidation rather than drug conjugation,
Notes:
and thus the habit becomes a factor to consider in the
interpretation of results for smokers.166 Smokers show
a high rate of caffeine clearance but low rates of acetaminophen mercapturate formation. Because oleic acid
activates the glucuronidation enzyme system,167 recommendation of olive oil as a dietary fat is one component
of intervention when production of acetaminophen
glucuronide is low.
When used as an analgesic, recommended doses
of acetaminophen should not be exceeded because of
hepatotoxic effects due to the hepatic sulfur conjugation
pathway having a relatively low capacity. Acetaminophen, on the other hand has a high affinity for the
conjugating enzymes, preventing them from processing other toxins and leading to hepatic necrosis in the

Conjugate Formation

Xenobiotic compounds (and natural toxicants or

detoxification by attaching highly polar groups to
increase water solubility. The sulfur-containing amino
acids are used to produce glutathione and sulfate for
the conjugation steps. Sulfated products are passed
into urine, whereas glutathione conjugates leave via the

of such hepatotoxic effects, both inorganic sulfate (as IV

Phase II Testing by Salicylic Acid Challenge
Phase II detoxification includes conjugation with
glycine, sulfate and glucuronic acid. A 650 mg dose
of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) taken in the evening is
converted to urinary conjugation products that appear
in overnight urine (Figure 8.15). A rapid, non-enzymatic reaction produces salicylic acid with release of
acetate. The free salicylate may then undergo either of
two enzymatic conjugation reactions with glucuronic
acid or enzymatic glycination, and the proportions of the
conjugated products that appear in urine reflect the ability to transform compounds by these pathways.168 When
glycine is adequate, the glycine conjugate salicyluric acid
is formed more easily than the glucuronides, so the relative amounts allow an assessment of these pathways.169
The results of this part of the challenge test are interpreted for adequacy of glucuronide and glycine conjugation capacity. For example, the individual described
earlier with a mild expression of Gilbert’s syndrome will
show a low percentage conversion to the glucuronides.
Low percentage conversion to salicyluric acid means
poor glycine conjugation due to inadequate hepatic glycine or coenzyme A (pantothenic acid) availability. Such
individuals will have slow clearance of many drugs and
natural toxicants. Oral supplementation with glycine
and pantothenic acid can be effective for increasing rates
of glycination. The salicylate challenge test may be used
to perform an additional assessment of antioxidant status because the high rate of reactivity of salicylate with
hydroxyl radicals to produce the two di-hydroxylated
products shown in Figure 8.15. Elevated percentages of
conversion into catechol or 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid
indicates inadequate antioxidant status to protect against
hydroxyl radical damage to PUFAs, DNA and proteins.170

potential than the initial xenobiotic. The normal progression would lead to efficient removal via Phase II
reactions. Patients with abnormally low Phase II or an
increased ratio of Phase I to Phase II may display hypersensitivity to xenobiotics, pharmaceuticals and other
toxin sources. If either of these conditions is found, detoxification is impaired and the results of toxin exposure
are amplified.

from inert deposition sites in bone.
The detoxification challenge profile revealed that
she was in danger of increased toxic consequences from
the accumulation of oxidized products because the caffeine clearance rate was high and the ratios of caffeine
clearance to glycination, sulfation and glucuronidation
conversion were all high. These results meant that her
P450 enzymes had a high rate of production of products that were only slowly removed by final conversion
to conjugated products. The accompanying urinary
lipid peroxide result was elevated, confirming her need
for decreased stimulation of oxidation and increased
conjugation. This could be accomplished by increasing
antioxidant supplementation and conjugation precursors
such as glycine, N-acetylcysteine and/or glutathione.

## The Cysteine/Sulfate Ratio
Cysteine is the precursor for hepatic sulfate formation (Figure 8.14). Disturbances in this pathway have
been observed in Alzheimer’s disease, which showed
early morning plasma cysteine/sulfate ratios that were
four to five times higher than controls.171 This situation
leads to concerns about metabolic interference from
excess cysteine and reduced xenobiotic detoxification
due to sulfate deficiency. The various challenge tests
commonly used to asses detoxification capacities are
summarized in Table 8.19.

conjugates. Secondary in total flux to these processes
are biosynthetic processes whereby methyl groups are
inserted in rings such as in DNA methylation or catecholamine biosynthesis.
Analysis of red blood cell activity of histamine
N-methyltransferase (HNMT) has been proposed
as a way to assess methylation in brain and other
tissues.172-177 HNMT catalyzes the N-tau-methylation
of histamine and structurally related compounds. This
reaction places a methyl group on the number 2 ring
nitrogen of histamine.

Methylation Status Assessment

Notes:
Methylation is a term that must be used with
care in discussing patient metabolic status assessment because of the multiplicity of implications that
require discrimination. The first clarification needed
is to expand the definition to the more encompassing
term of “single carbon transfer status.” As described in
Chapter 2, “Vitamins,” active methyl groups can be created by direct activation of methionine to SAM and by
alpha-carbon extraction from serine or glycine cleavage
to form 5, 10-methylene-THF (see Figure 2.11). The
single carbon group may then undergo various reversible
transformations, ultimately being trapped in the methylfolate form until vitamin B12-catalyzed transfer to homocysteine can occur with reformation of methionine.
The two metabolic processes that dominate single
carbon transfer status are biotransformation of compounds for elimination and glutathione formation in
response to oxidative stress. Glutathione also takes part
in biotransformation via the formation of mercaptan

Ethanol Intoxication
Alcohol-dependent individuals show a 300% variation in their rate of clearance of ethanol from blood.178
Several clinical laboratory tests are pertinent to nutrient
status critical for alcohol detoxification. Amino acids
tend to become depleted due to lowered dietary protein
intake and impaired digestive function. Amino acid
insufficiencies can reduce the efficacy of detoxification
programs for alcoholic patients because of the behavioral impact of poor neurotransmitter synthesis. Brain
serotonin and dopamine levels are directly impacted by
lowered plasma levels of tryptohan and tyrosine, respectively (see Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”). Thus, chronic
ethanol consumption has negative effects on many
aspects of nutrient intake and assimilation.
Ethanol is metabolized through at least two inducible pathways in the liver. Alcohol and aldehyde
dehydrogenase enzymes make up the most well-known
pathway, but ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450
enzymes can also play a role. High ethanol consumption causes variations in the activities and synthesis of
these enzymes. The ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450
enzymes may be decreased by components in garlic.179
Simultaneous exposure to other classes of toxicants adds
further variability in responses among alcohol-dependent patients.
The ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 is believed
to be predominantly microsomal. High rates of activity lead to oxidative damage and generation of radical
species that ultimately contribute to lipid peroxidation.
Inhibition of this enzyme by the oxidation product
trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal seems to be a mechanism
of negative regulation that can result in limiting ethanol
oxidation capacity.180 Concurrent ethanol and lead exposure greatly increases hepatic zinc loss,181 and moderate
amounts of ethanol decrease the conversion of toluene
to the glycine conjugate hippuric acid by 37%.181 A
simple way to assess the adequacy of glycine conjugation
is to check for urinary benzoate elevation in a urinary
organic acid profile (Chapter 6, “Organic Acids”).
Notes:
## Intervention Options
To treat abnormal effects of toxin exposure, one
must reduce exposure and facilitate removal of toxic
burdens. Although identification of sources of exposure
is never simple, cases of chronic exposure generally
present further difficulty in locating the multiple toxin
sources. Books dealing with management of the chemically sensitive patient are available.182
Refer to Case Illustration 8.1

## Toxin-Related Nutrient Status
In the preface to his landmark work on chronic,
low-level toxic responses, sometimes called “chemical
sensitivity,” Dr. William Rea describes the relationship of
nutrients to pollutants: “The final chapter in this volume
is on nutrition, which provides fuel for the endocrine,
immunologic, and neurological systems and equips the
body to respond to pollutant exposure.”182 He aims to
lead physicians to realize the importance of strengthening innate systems to properly handle toxins through
nutrient therapy.
Nutrition plays a key role in toxin management,
which requires a significant portion of total-body energy
generation, as well as integrated function of the gastrointestinal, hepaticobiliary, cardiovascular, renal, lung, skin
and immune systems. The overall functions are to prevent
toxin entry, to identify toxins that penetrate the barriers,
to modify toxins into more easily managed forms and to
provide mechanisms for removal. The immune system is
included in this discussion because of the central importance of handling macromolecular and cellular agents that
can cause such devastating effects via the combination of
atopic reactions and large antigen-antibody complexes
as described in Chapter 7, “GI Function.” Such reactions
may be considered as components of detoxification.
Detoxification pathways are metabolically demanding. Nutrients are consumed in numerous toxin-modifying reactions that generally involve the formation of new
chemical bonds in energy-requiring steps.183 Toxic effects of copper-based antineoplastic drugs (Casiopeinas)
cause inhibition of mitochondrial functions, decreasing
overall energy for detoxification reactions.184
Nutrient deficiencies, in turn, cause difficulty with
toxicant clearance. One example is the marked reduction in the clearance of acetaminophen due to inhibition

of energy pathways.185 Even mild nutrient depletions
can alter dose-response characteristics.186 Thus, a
patient’s response to drugs and environmental toxins
depends on their nutritional status, whereas exposures
to toxins exacerbate nutrient depletions. Dietary habits
have direct influence on detoxification pathways. Lowprotein diets cause increased mortality of laboratory
animals from exposure to pesticides, chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates.156
Specific nutrient interventions should be guided by
test results. Although all essential nutrients are required
to maintain normal metabolic function of hepatic cells,
those most closely involved with support of detoxification
are shown in Table 8.20. N-acetylcysteine has become a
favored oral supplement for glutathione synthesis, but it
must be used with care. In patients with high heavy metal
body burden, cysteine may increase mobilization of heavy
metals from sequestered sites. Selenium is a mineral that
is directly involved in glutathione maintenance through
activation of glutathione peroxidase.
Because of similarities in chemical bonding,
heavy metals show reduced toxic effects when specific
inhibitory nutrient elements are increased as shown
in Table 8.20. A good example of this effect is the
protective action of dietary calcium against the toxic
accumulation of lead, both of which compete for the

same binding sites. The fact that lead deposits in bone
where it interacts with the calcium regulatory enzymes187
further confirms the competition of these two elements
for binding sites. Extra calcium during pregnancy even
protects against transfer of lead to the fetus from a
mother with prior lead exposure.188 Thus, if a test such
as a hair mineral profile reveals an elevated lead level
and concurrent negative calcium balance, aggressive
calcium supplementation as well as removal of lead
exposure is indicated. Recognition of such relationships
between nutrients and toxicants leads to better clinical
insight regarding the variations in individual responses
to toxin exposure. The data presented here on nutrient-toxic element interactions are a simplification of the
total picture of such effects, which is quite complex with
multiple cross-element relationships.189
Amino acids containing sulfur and essential trace
elements are high on the list of priority nutrients in virtually every case of clinical toxicology. Beans, eggs, garlic
and onions are foods that are rich sources for many
of these critical nutrients. The cruciferous family of
vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) contain
substances that stimulate the liver to produce Phase I
and II enzymes.

Clinical Management
of Detoxification
When toxin exposure is determined to merit clinical
intervention, the first order of business is to reduce the
total body burden of toxin by avoiding exposure. For
xenobiotics, the source must be identified, and avoided.
This sometimes means extensive modifications of home
and work environments.182
For toxins resulting from intestinal microbial overgrowth, methods for controlling microbial populations
and improving the integrity of the physical barrier may
be implemented (see Chapter 7, “GI Function”). A summary of such interventions is presented in Table 8.21.
Removal of foods that elicit immune responses will
ease a major burden from the toxin entry barrier of the
gut. The normal opening of channels for the outward
flow of secretory IgA is impaired in chronic inflammatory states of the gut. Formation of antigen-IgG complexes
and loss of antioxidant protection can impair the barrier
function against antigen entry.
A chemically defined diet can provide a period
of relative absence of antigens to achieve reduction of
endogenous toxin exposure. Formulations are widely
available containing chemically defined, balanced proportions of major nutrients supplemented with nutrients
that support detoxification. The ultimate elimination
of toxin entry via the gut may require total water fasting. Those with high body burdens of toxins must be
managed carefully to successfully employ fasting. The
absence of food intake can increase the mobilization
of stored toxins whereas the heightened detoxification
activity demands extra nutrients.
In addition to the issue of reducing toxin loads,
detoxification metabolic rates should be addressed. One
effective way to increase the rate of removal of toxins
from the body is to stimulate hepaticobiliary flow and
maintain optimal intestinal transit time. Use of dietary

oils (especially olive oil) can be helpful as cholegogues
to stimulate bile flow and gall bladder emptying.190
Patients who have undergone cholecystectomy will respond more slowly to cholegogues since the capacity for
bile storage is greatly reduced.
High-fiber diets help maintain speedy intestinal transit to assist toxin removal in feces and avoid
re-acquisition via entero-hepatic cycling.191-193 Fast
colonic transit time is essential to reduce microbial
toxicant production and to lower the reuptake of toxins
released in bile. When stool testing reveals increased
intestinal bacterial glucuronidase levels, all compounds
that had been processed through Phase I and II systems
to form glucuronides may be released for reabsorption (Chapter 7). Unabsorbed dietary fiber binds many
toxins and allows them to be removed in stools. The
National Cancer Institute recommends between 20 and
35 grams of fiber daily. The average American eats less
than half of this recommended intake. High-fiber cereals
are one of the easiest sources to find fiber, as one serving
size can be as high as 8 to10 grams. Other measures
suitable for most patients are listed in Table 8.22.
The skin is a large organ of detoxification via the
loss of toxins in sweat.194, 195 Use of sauna and massage
can accomplish stimulation of toxin losses through
increased blood flow and sweating.196 Finally, it must be
emphasized that the gut is an organ of detoxification at
least as important as the liver or skin. The hepatic detoxification reactions discussed in this chapter also occur
in the mucosal cells of the gut.197-202 Clinical laboratory
assessment of gastrointestinal function is discussed in
Chapter 7, “GI Function.”
Chronic ethanol consumption has a dramatic effect
on the conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin
in the brain.203 This inhibitory effect may explain the
clinically beneficial action of maintaining low concentration of ethanol during alcohol detoxification.204 The

Eat legumes. Not only are beans rich in fiber, but many
are also high quality protein sources and low in fat.
Use whole grains. Increasing whole-grain bread and
wheat bran effectively incorporates fiber.
Eat cereals high in fiber. Check the food labels on your
breakfast cereal for dietary fiber.
Consume more berries. Add berries to pancake batters
and muffin-mix recipes.

suppression of serotonergic pathways in the brain is a
chemical phenomenon relevant to the addictiveness of
alcohol. Amino acid testing can be helpful in alcoholic
detoxification programs to evaluate the status of neurotransmitter-related amino acids: tryptophan, tyrosine,
GABA, and glutamate (see Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”).
Since detoxification pathways are used to clear
endogenously produced compounds, there are circumstances where it may be desired to decrease the rate of
clearance. For example, androstenedione, a potent male
anabolic hormone is cleared by hydroxylation and oxidation enzymes that are inhibited by increasing intake of
olive oil. This effect appears to be mediated by various
phenolic compounds in olive oil, and it is an example of
how diet influences hormone levels.205 Since the effects
can be specific to hepatic CYP isoforms, metabolism of
ingested toxins and sex hormones may vary depending
on the principal dietary oil. Activity of CYP450-3A2 is
stimulated by soybean oil, whereas olive and corn oil
can decrease CYP2C11 class activities.206 These dietary
variables add to the overall individual variability of response to toxicants and endogenous metabolites.
The concept of genetic influences modified by
diet is relevant in assessment of toxicant exposures.
Early initiation of dietary and drug restrictions has
been recommended for patients with X-chromosomal
mutations involving MAO. Individuals with Norrie’s
disease have a deletion in chromosomal region Xp11.3
that causes non-detectable monoamine oxidase activity.
They can show up to 100-fold elevations in the urinary
levels of MAO substrates phenylethylamine, o-tyramine

and m-tyramine.207 Dietary restriction should include
bananas because of their high levels of dopamine. Dopamine and other biogenic amines are normally modified
by intestinal MAO.

Conclusion
Because of modern lifestyles, environmental toxicants play ever-increasing roles in human health. Health
threats from the environment are overlaid on detoxification systems that may already be in difficulty due
to endogenous or iatrogenic sources of toxicants. Our
growing knowledge of genetic influences brings another
dimension to patient management through specific
measures that might correct impaired detoxification
capacities or that offset the results of defective toxicant
processing. Laboratory evaluations can provide multiple
levels of insight about toxic loads, detoxification status
and metabolic effects of toxicant exposures. By combining evaluations of toxic exposures and detoxification
capacities with evaluations of individual nutritional
insufficiency, new approaches are being developed for
managing clinical effects of toxicants.

Diet-Induced Transient Toxic Symptoms

An otherwise healthy, symptom-free 60-year-old male
complains of a highly predictable sleep disturbance that
occurs only when he drinks a glass of wine with a late, highprotein dinner followed by a cup of coffee. Such meals are
always followed by waking from sleep about 4 hours later
feeling hot, sweaty and thirsty with rapid heart rate. Return
to sleep is possible only 30 to 45 minutes after drinking
water. When dinner is eaten earlier without wine, he can
drink coffee an hour before bedtime and have a normal
6- to 7-hour sleep period.
Tests results show that he has a mild form of Gilbert’s
syndrome with chronically elevated total bilirubin and
normal direct (unconjugated) bilirubin, showing a mild
weakness in glucuronidation. His total bilirubin values had
ranged from 1.6 to 2.4 over the past decade. A detoxification
challenge profile shows that his caffeine clearance rate is
high, glucuronidation is slightly low and other conjugation
rates are within normal ranges.
Here we have a case where the imbalance of oxidation and
conjugation is mild enough to be entirely benign except

when the extra load of alcohol, polyphenols and other
ingredients in wine are added along with stimulation of
Phase I oxidation with caffeine. Then the accumulation of
oxidized products requiring glucuronidation is great enough
to produce polyuria and transient cardiac and brain neurotoxic effects. Since this is primarily a manifestation of genetic
polymorphism affecting glucuronidation, the obvious simple
solution is to avoid the offending meal combination. v
