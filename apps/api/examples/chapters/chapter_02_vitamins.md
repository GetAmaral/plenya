## Introduction

“Up to 30% of
genetic polymorphisms
are associated with
decreased coenzyme
affinity.”

Vitamin status may be assessed using a variety
of direct and indirect measurements. Concentrations
of vitamins can be measured in serum or blood cells.
Vitamin metabolites may be measured in blood or urine.
Changes in response to added vitamins may be measured as specific enzyme activities in blood or growth of
leukocytes in cell culture. Finally, functional adequacy of
a particular vitamin can be revealed by the urinary levels
of specific metabolic intermediates controlled by the action of the vitamin.
Urinary organic acid analysis has traditionally been
used for the detection of genetic diseases leading to frank
inborn errors of metabolism.1 Although up to 30% of
genetic polymorphisms are associated with decreased
coenzyme binding affinifty,2 it is now widely accepted
that genetic polymorphisms have a range of severity. One
example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). The condition is primarily known to result from a faulty enzyme
complex (branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase).
However there are numerous subunits and configurations
that can be affected, so there is a range of possible downstream consequences. Research has identified patients
diagnosed with MSUD who were found to be responsive
to moderate to large doses of thiamin.2 Similarly functional
deficits of coenzyme vitamins are revealed in organic acid
testing. It follows logically that there may be many yet
undiagnosed milder forms of these genetic polymorphisms
with symptoms not generally associated with the frank
disease. These milder genetic variants may not appear
until a patient encounters a specific stress, or life stage
such as adolescence, or a nutrient deficiency that slows the
enzyme reaction. For routine clinical purposes, the most
useful assay gives a clear answer to the question of whether body pools are adequate to meet current demands.
Table 2.1 shows a summary of the laboratory evaluations
of vitamin status that are discussed in this chapter.

Methods of
Vitamin Assessments
Vitamins encompass several classes of compounds.
The challenge of determining adequacy of body stores
is complicated by the diversity of structures, the presence of multiple forms and the availability of specimens
reflecting the whole body vitamin stores. No single
assay can give adequate information about all vitamins.
Technological advances for detecting metabolic markers of vitamin deficiencies have made functional testing
available. Concurrently, the knowledge of metabolic
intermediates that can serve as markers of functional
deficiencies has also grown.3
For various reasons specific to each vitamin, it is
possible for an individual to have normal serum levels of
a vitamin while exhibiting signs of insufficiency for that
vitamin owing to a lack of adequate intracellular concentration to meet the metabolic demands of the cells.
For example, serum vitamin B12 can be normal while the

chromatography (GC/MS). For further discussion of
instrumentation, see Chapter 1, “Basic Concepts.”
An enzyme stimulation assay works by adding
saturating amounts of a vitamin to an enzyme whose
activity is dependent on that vitamin to cause an increase
in activity. The increase in enzyme activity corresponds
to how poorly the enzyme was initially supplied with the
vitamin (called cofactor saturation). Erythrocyte transketolase activity, for example, is dependent on thiamin
pyrophosphate (TPP). The activity is measured without
any added TPP and again after adding excess TPP. The
increase in activity may be expressed as a ratio or percentage.4 Abnormally high increases in activity indicate
the degree of deficiency. An inherent limitation of the
assay is that only one enzyme in erythrocytes is examined
so total body functional status of the vitamin may not be
revealed.
Another type of stimulation assay involves whole
cell responses. Leukocytes are removed from the patient
sample and grown in media with increasing concentrations of the vitamin to be assayed. Vitamins must be
added in their active cofactor forms. Changes in growth
rate at increasing levels of added nutrients provide a
measure of the initial state of nutrient adequacy. Cells
from a vitamin-deficient patient will require more added
vitamin to achieve maximum growth than those from a
well-nourished patient. This approach has great potential because it measures the total cellular response to
the nutrient. The limitation is that, as with protozoan
growth assays, there are many variables controlling the
growth of whole leukocytes. Current techniques present
extreme challenges to control all possible variables in the
growth media. Because the technique depends on the
initial viability of the cells, specimen transport also adds
a significant variable. It is available for most vitamins and
other classes of essential nutrients.5

metabolic intermediate methylmalonate is elevated owing to inadequate intracellular vitamin B12 to sustain the
function of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.
An intermediate in a pathway that normally has
high flux owing to macronutrient processing provides
the greatest sensitivity of a metabolic marker for revealing early or mild vitamin insufficiency. The amino acid
catabolic pathways offer this advantage. One example
of this is the degradation of excess histidine to glutamic
acid through the intermediate formiminoglutamic acid
(FIGLU). The conversion of FIGLU to glutamic acid
requires the participation of folic acid and mild insufficiencies of the vitamin produce elevations of FIGLU.
The severity of FIGLU elevation may be related to the
severity of folic acid deficiency, under standard dietary
protein intake conditions. Using this type of relationship, it is therefore possible to specifically tailor nutrient
supplementation according to the need for repletion to
restore the metabolic capacity. Since many of the metabolic markers we will discuss are amino acid pathway
intermediates, a high protein meal or challenge dose of
amino acids prior to specimen collection may be employed to maximize the sensitivity of the test.
The first widely available tests of vitamin concentrations in serum were microbiological growth assays.
Protozoan organisms whose growth is dependent on the
presence of vitamins are grown in media that supply all
but the vitamin being tested. The assays are very labor
intensive and, because of the large number of variables
affecting growth of whole cells, the reliability of results is
frequently poor. These methods have been replaced by
immunoassays with greater sensitivity and reproducibility and lower cost.
Vitamins A, E, beta-carotene and coenzyme Q10 are
typically measured in serum using high performance
liquid chromatography with various detectors. The fatsoluble components are extracted from the specimen
and need no further preparation prior to injection
into the instrument for chromatographic separation.
Vitamin D, also in serum, can be measured by
immunological assay or HPLC. The urinary organic acid
markers of vitamin status, however, are more accurately
measured by chromatographic separation (either gas
or liquid) coupled with mass spectrometric detection.
The newer technology of liquid chromatography
with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC/MS/
MS) requires less sample preparation and therefore
is more accurate than the older methods using gas

Notes:

## Assessing Vitamin Status
Vitamin A (Retinol) and
Beta-Carotene
Active forms: All-trans-retinoic acid (retinoic acid), 9-cis-retinoic acid,
13-cis-retinoic acid,6 11-cis-retinal
Biochemical role: Cell proliferation,6 cell differentiation, vision
Examples: 11-cis-retinal + light ➔ all-trans-retinoic acid
Deficiency tests: Vitamin A-serum / beta-carotene-serum

Physiological Function: Specific maintenance
roles for vitamin A have been reported for vision, bone
growth, skin and mucosal integrity, spermatogenesis,
as well as protection against cataracts, atherosclerosis,
macular degeneration and cancer.6, 7 The effects of vitamin A are tissue-specific. Retinoic acid inhibits proliferation of tumors, including breast, prostate, non-small-cell
lung and thyroid cancers, as well as myeloid leukemias.6
Retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid bind to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR), while 9-cis-retinoic acid can
also bind to nuclear retinoid X receptors (RXR), thereby
acting as hormones and affecting cell cycle.8 In addition
to the mechanism of retinoic acid in vision, vitamin A
is also involved in sub-cellular membrane function and
mucopolysaccharide synthesis.9 Vitamin A in animal
foods (e.g., liver, dairy products and fish) comes in the
form of preformed vitamin A. Vitamin A from plants
comes from provitamin A or carotenoids.10 Preformed
vitamin A is more active than provitamin A, thus a larger
amount of provitamin A from carotenoids is needed to
meet the vitamin A requirement.10
Deficiency: Deficiencies of vitamin A result from inadequate diets, excessive alcohol intake, gastrointestinal
conditions with diarrhea or fat malabsorption, as well
as insufficient protein, energy and zinc status leading
to inadequate retinol binding synthesis.11-13 Hypovitaminosis A is a major nutritional problem throughout
the world, including in several North American populations, though more profound in developing countries.14
In these populations, severe vitamin A deficiency leads
to xerophthalmia, the most common cause of blindness
in young children.15 Hypovitaminosis A can also lead
to anorexia, growth retardation, recurrent infections,
obstruction and enlargement of hair follicles, keratinization of skin epithelial cells and microcytic anemia.8
Increased mortality is associated with clinically evident

Adult repletion: 5,000 to 10,000 IU/d

hypovitaminosis A in children; however, children with
hypovitaminosis A but without overt clinical signs are
also at increased risk for mortality.8
Assessment of Status: Vitamin A status has no
known impact on circulating enzyme activities or excretion of metabolic intermediates, so there is no biochemical measurement of functional vitamin A deficiency.
Thus measurement of serum vitamin A concentration
remains the best method to assess individual nutritional
status of this vitamin. Serum concentrations of vitamin
A fall during low dietary intake.16 A dose-response relationship exists between oral supplementation and serum
vitamin A in humans. Once normal tissue levels are
obtained, daily intake of vitamin A has been maintained
at levels of 10,000 IU for five years without significant
long-term rise in serum retinol.17 Serum retinol levels
< 30 µg/dl indicate depleted liver stores of vitamin A,
while levels between 30 and 60 reflect increasing liver
stores. A patient with both a long-standing low intake
of vitamin A and a low tissue reserve may have a serum
concentration < 20 µg/dl. Adult men achieve a level of
approximately 60 µg/dl at a retinol intake of 2,400 µg
(8,000 IU) per day.18, 19 Adult repletion can generally be
achieved with supplementation of 5,000 to 10,000 IU a

day for 90 days, though consideration should be made
to the size of the person and any immune challenges, or
losses of vitamin A, such as during lactation. Serum levels greater than 150 µg/dl indicate excessive vitamin A
intake with potential toxic responses. Acute, chronic and
teratogenic syndromes of vitamin A toxicity have been
associated with very high doses. Danger of such toxic
responses is especially high during early pregnancy.19

Epidemiologic research and clinical trials overall have found that increased dietary intakes and
elevated serum levels of beta-carotene are associated
with decreased rates of disease.27 However, two large
clinical trials of smokers and asbestos workers found
those given high doses of synthetic beta-carotene
supplements had higher rates of lung cancer and
raised questions concerning the safety of supplements for high risk populations.28-30 There are many
possible reasons why these clinical trials did not
show the protective benefits seen in other research
and are discussed elsewhere.31, 32
Vitamin A deficiency inhibits thyroid function.33
Conversely, thyroid hormone is involved in carotenoid metabolism and transport. Elevated beta-carotene and retinol concentrations in plasma are often
associated with hypothyroidism.34, 35 In the United
States, almost 75% of average dietary retinol equivalents is supplied as preformed vitamin A and 25% is
in the form of beta-carotene.36

Notes:

are maintained independently so that, unless vitamin A
levels are initially low, increased intake of beta-carotene
may not affect higher levels of vitamin A.26
Refer to Case Illustration 2.1

Carotenoids — Dark-colored fruits and vegetables
are excellent sources of carotenoids.20 Carotenoids are
a family of closely related compounds. More than 600
carotenoids have been identified and many, but not all,
can be converted into retinol.8 Of all the carotenoids,
beta-carotene is converted into retinol most efficiently.21
The absorption of beta-carotene and its conversion to
vitamin A varies among individuals. Research has found
some individuals have an impaired absorption and conversion and are referred to as low responders.22 Methods have been developed for the measurement of up to
50 different carotenoids in plasma.23, 24 Although little
useful clinical information is gained from such exhaustive analysis, the measurement of beta-carotene along
with serum vitamin A is useful because beta-carotene is
converted into vitamin A in the liver (Figure 2.1). Thus
beta-carotene serves as a pool that may be converted
into vitamin A. It also has antioxidant and other roles independent of vitamin A. Research has shown beta-carotene supplementation to result in significant dose-related
decreases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride fractions,
indicating anti-hyperlipidemic effects in spontaneously
hypertensive rats.25 Body pools of the two compounds

## Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)
Active form: Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP)
Biochemical role: Decarboxylation
Example: Pyruvate ➔ Acetyl-CoA + CO2
Deficiency tests: alpha-keto acids- urine; Erythrocyte
Transketolase Index

Physiological Function: The two primary functions of thiamin are alpha-keto acid decarboxylation
and transketolation.10 Decarboxylation reactions are an
integral part of carbohydrate metabolism.37 Thiamin is
involved in the alpha-keto acid decarboxylation of pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate and the branched-chain alphaketo acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine metabolites).
Transketolation is involved in the pentose phosphate
pathways and is an early marker of decreasing thiamin
levels.7, 38 Thiamin is converted to its active form—thiamin pyrophosphate—the primary coenzymatic form
(Figure 2.2).38
Deficiency: Food processing, elevated pH and high
temperatures result in significant losses of thiamin.10 The
ease with which thiamin is depleted by processing rice
creates an increased risk of deficiency among populations where rice is the staple food. A cross-sectional survey of an adult Mediterranean population found 6.4%
deficient in thiamin according to the erythrocyte transketolase assay (described below).39 Increased vigilance
to ensure thiamin supplementation during pregnancy is
suggested because sub-clinical thiamin hypovitaminemia
is prominent during pregnancy despite vitamin supplementation.40 During the third trimester among Spanish
women, 25% of subjects were found to have intakes
below recommended levels and 14% showed signs of
severe thiamin deficiency.41 Because of the thiamin depleting effects of gestational diabetes, subclinical thiamin
hypovitaminemia was also found in 19% of pregnant

Adult repletion: 50 to 200 mg/d

mothers despite vitamin supplementation and prescribed glycemic control. These observations have led to
the hypothesis that macrosomic neonates from mothers
with gestational diabetes might display a fetal form of
wet beriberi with symptoms of pudgy face, plump body,
cardiomegaly and pitting edema.40
Assessment of Status: Thiamin deficiency will occur when intake is insufficient to maintain tissue levels
high enough to supply all enzymatic demands. The
need for adequate functional thiamin to achieve optimal
health for individuals is demonstrated in the growing list
of known thiamin-responsive disorders of metabolism,
which includes hyperkinetic cardiomyopathy, megaloblastic anemia and thiamin-responsive maple syrup
urine disease.2, 42 Genetic polymorphisms of thiamin-dependent enzymes can alter thiamin binding affinity and
enzyme function. This can result in abnormally rapid
urinary losses of thiamin. Tissue and serum levels that
are in the “normal range” may be insufficient in most
individuals. In these people, providing higher-than-normal doses of thiamin can increase enzyme activity and
correct functional deficiencies. Biochemical markers
of functional sufficiency are therefore the most useful
measure of adequacy. For example, three family members with dysautonomic symptoms, comparable to those
seen in classical beriberi, required high doses of thiamin
tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide to restore biochemical function as measured by transketolase activity.43
Transketolase — Erythrocytes heavily utilize
the pentose phosphate pathway to produce reducing
equivalents for maintaining reduced glutathione. This
pathway involves two steps catalyzed by a transketolase
enzyme that requires thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP).
This enzyme may be used to perform a stimulation assay from a whole blood specimen. A “TPP stimulation”
result greater than 14% demonstrates a significant risk

deficiency.45 Thiamin deficiency also results in increased
blood pyruvate, but this effect is not specific for thiamin.46 The combination most useful for assessing an
individual’s need for thiamin is isoleucine, pyruvate,
alpha-ketoisovalerate, alpha-ketoisocaproate and alphaketo-beta-methylvalerate (Table 2.2). The latter three are
the keto acids of valine, leucine and isoleucine, respectively. Further information may be found in Chapter 6,
“Organic Acids.”

Urinary Functional Markers — A better test for
revealing functional thiamin deficiency may be the
detection of elevated branched-chain keto acids in urine.
The most sensitive and definitive measure of thiamin adequacy is obtained from detection of increased levels of
amino acids and their keto acid analogs that are excreted
in the absence of adequate tissue levels of thiamin. Because the catabolism of amino acids is a heavily utilized
pathway in the liver, the breakdown of branched-chain
amino acids (BCAAs) affords an opportunity for detecting interruptions in the pathway caused by inadequacy
of thiamin. Leucine, isoleucine and valine are deaminated to their corresponding keto acids prior to the first
thiamin-dependent step.
Increased plasma or urine isoleucine, or the appearances of significant levels of branched-chain keto acids
(BCKAs) in urine are markers of functional thiamin

of thiamin deficiency.44 This approach is useful, but it is
focused on a single enzyme in erythrocytes. Limits have
been proposed for higher risk of deficiency (Table 2.3).

Urinary Thiamin — A portion of a thiamin load
administered orally or intramuscularly will appear in
urine within a few hours if the tissues are replete with
thiamin. Parenteral administration of 5 mg of thiamin
should result in the appearance of at least 20 µg in urine
over the next four hours.47 The parenteral thiamin load
test is primarily useful as an indicator of intake, rather
than functional sufficiency of thiamin.
The test used most frequently for population surveys is a measurement of urinary thiamin concentration.
Urinary excretion of thiamin decreases proportionately
with thiamin intake. This fact has led to measurement
of thiamin levels in urine as an indicator of adequacy in
nutrition surveys. Both 24-hour and random urine tests
have been used to assess thiamin intake. Random urine
readings, expressed as mg per gm of creatinine to correct
for dilution, are directly related to intake in the range of
0.2 to 0.8 mg thiamin/100 Cal/day.48, 49 When results are
expressed per gm creatinine, children have much higher
excretion rates than adults, necessitating the use of a
sliding scale for reference limits (Table 2.3).

excrete high levels of these compounds and show symptoms of easy fatigability and exercise intolerance have

Riboflavin Excretion — Controlled human studies
have established a correlation between dietary intake
of riboflavin and urinary excretion of the vitamin.
Individuals consuming less than the recommended
amount of riboflavin excrete less than 100 µg of
riboflavin per day. Urinary levels tend to reflect recent
dietary intake and thus are prone to large variations.
Children excrete more riboflavin per gram of creatinine than adults, so age-adjusted reference ranges are
necessary. Erythocyte Flavin Concentrations (EFC)
can be done to assess cellular conentrations.59

functional measure of riboflavin adequacy. The value is
expressed as the EGR Activity Coefficient, which is the
ratio of activity with added FAD, divided by the activity
without added FAD. This assay was used to demonstrate the presence of riboflavin deficiency in 5.3% of a
random sample of 3,390 subjects from a cross-sectional
survey of an adult Mediterranean population.39
EGR Activity Coefficient is a good indicator of riboflavin status, but not function, in a population with low
(< 1.0 mg) dietary riboflavin intake.59

Physiological Function: The two main forms of
vitamin B3 are niacinamide and niacin (Figure 2.4).
Its active coenzyme forms are nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Vitamin B3 maintains
cellular redox state via NAD and NADP, which function
as coenzymes in oxidation and reduction reactions.
NADP serves as a hydrogen donor and NAD serves as
an electron acceptor.7, 38 NAD and NADP cycle between
their reduced forms, NADH+H+ and NADPH+H+50.
Many oxido-reductase enzymes that utilize NADP and
NAD function in catabolic pathways.51
Deficiency: In niacin-deficient animals, the biological responses to niacin, nicotinic acid and its amine
form, niacinamide, are virtually equivalent (except at supraphysiological doses) because of the ease with which
the liver produces the amine from the acid. Dietary analysis is complicated by the fact that nicotinamide is frequently bound in unavailable forms in foods, especially
corn. The amino acid tryptophan can serve as a precursor to niacin in humans, but the conversion is dependent on adequate status of both vitamin B6 and iron.60
Although the optimum conversion of tryptophan to
niacin yields only 1 mg from 60 mg of amino acid, daily
L-tryptophan intake of several hundred milligrams can
make a very significant contribution to total body niacin. For this reason, studies of niacin requirements are
conducted by restricting dietary niacin and tryptophan.

Of Further Interest…

When choosing forms of supplemental niacin,
consider potential nicotinamide effects on DNA. The
sirtuins are a family of proteins linked to lifespan
determination. In lower organisms, increased expression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2 increases lifespan.66 Genes for mitochondrial biogenesis are
among those regulated by Sir2.67 Nicotinamide is an
inhibitor of human class III histone deacetylases such
as SIRT1. Genetic expression of the hematopoietic
malignancy-stimulating protein called B cell leukemia 11A protein (BCL11A) is inhibited (silenced)
by SIRT1.68 The overall effects may be a shortening
of maximum lifespan along with increased rates of
malignancy while experiencing short term benefits
from regular, aggressive use of niacinaminde instead
of niacin, especially in the patient with relatively
replete body stores of the vitamin. However, no
adverse effects on aging have been demonstrated
when nicotinamide is used for repletion of a niacindeficient patient.

Notes:

The increased diversion of tryptophan into the serotonin
pathway that occurs in carcinoid cancer patients puts
them at increased risk of niacin deficiency.61
In addition to its enzyme cofactor role, NAD+ is also
the substrate for the enzyme that adds polyadenosyl
chains to DNA as part of the gene repair mechanism.
This reaction acts as a drain on the cofactor pool. Hyperoxia causes increased poly(ADP-ribose) formation to
promote DNA repair and the ensuing niacin deficiency
causes adaptive shifts in whole body NAD+ metabolism.62 Other experimentally induced cell injury effects
are enhanced by niacin deficiency.63
Assessment of Status: Biochemical markers are especially helpful in assessment of niacin adequacy owing
to the difficulty in establishing an accurate dietary intake
and the wide range of symptoms related to niacin deficiency. Urinary nicotinic acid is relatively uninfluenced
by dietary intake of niacin or tryptophan.
Testing based on excretion of catabolic products of
niacin (i.e., N-methylnicotinamide) has been developed,
but the test is not sensitive enough for use as a functional marker of mild deficiency states. The whole blood
niacin number, a derived ratio of NAD/NADP x 100, has
been used to demonstrate niacin deficiency (niacin number < 130) in carcinoid syndrome patients.61 Erythrocyte
NAD and polyadenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation
are promising markers of niacin depletion.59 Urinary
keto acid elevations provide potential biochemical markers of niacin deficiency. Since the keto acid dehydrogenase complex requires NAD+ as a coenzyme, a niacin
deficiency is also likely to produce keto acid elevations
similar to that described above for thiamin.

Increased fecal fat has been noted in niacin deficient
rats, possibly due to impairment of intestinal protein
absorption. Animal research has also found the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells to be highly dependent
on niacin availability.65

## Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)

establish conclusively. Animals placed on diets without
pantothenic acid display loss of appetite, slow growth,
skin lesions, weakness and death.50, 69 When body stores
of coenzyme A are exhausted, all tissues experience
massive decline in activity of energetic and biosynthetic
pathways.70 The pervasive nature of the effects on critical
organs results in rapid, simultaneous decline of many
functions, including the central nervous system.
Assessment of Status: When multiple intermediates from pathways that require the carrier function are
found to be elevated, it is an indication that inadequate
pantothenic acid is limiting optimum metabolism.
Intermediates commonly reported in urinary organic
acid analysis that can provide such clues are pyruvate,
alpha-ketoisocaproate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, alphaketo-β-methyl-valerate and alpha-ketoglutarate (see
Chapter 6, “Organic Acids”). Urinary excretion of pantothenic acid less than 1.0 mg/day is also indicative of
inadequate intake.71

Active form: Coenzyme A (CoA)
Biochemical role: Carrier for acyl groups
Examples: Acetyl-CoA, Fatty acyl-CoA
Deficiency tests: Alpha-keto acids – urine, Pantothenic acid – urine

Physiological Function: By utilizing 3 ATPs and
cysteine, pantothenic acid is converted into its active
form, coenzyme-A in the liver (Figure 2.5). It functions
as the acyl carrier in keto acid and fatty acid oxidation.
All oxidation pathways for carbohydrate, fat and protein
require coenzyme-A to carry acetate, keto-acids, or fatty
acid intermediates during key oxidative steps.
Deficiency: Pantothenic acid or pantothenate
derives its name from the observation that it is found in
all life forms. It is found therefore, in all whole foods.
Because of the centrality of coenzyme A in metabolic
function, a mild pantothenic acid deficiency, or insufficiency, is one of the most difficult nutrient conditions to

## Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)

Plasma vitamin B6 concentration may provide a useful measure of a patient’s inflammatory status. Individuals with active inflammatory bowel disease were found
to have lower median vitamin B6 levels than normal controls. Furthermore, the frequency of low plasma vitamin
B6 in patients with active disease was found to be much
higher than in patients without active disease. Low vitamin B6 concentrations were also strongly correlated with
elevated levels of C-reactive protein.75
Deficiency: Vitamin B6 deficiencies affect the
metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This can
result in seborrheic dermatitis, cheilosis and glossitis,
or cause a decrease in neurotransmitters leading to irritability, depression and confusion. Finally, vitamin B6
deficiency can decrease hemoglobin synthesis leading to
microcytic anemia.38, 59 Patients whose plasma fatty acids
profile shows an elevated ratio of alpha linolenic acid to
docosahexaenoic acid may be deficient in vitamin B6.76
Smoking further increases the incidence of vitamin B6
deficiency.77

Active form: Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P-5-P or PLP)
Biochemical role: Amino acid metabolism
Example: Homocysteine + Serine ➔ Cystathionine
Deficiency tests: Xanthurenate and Kynurenate – urine,
Homocysteine – plasma, EGOT Index, EGPT Index, PLP- plasma

Table 2.5 —Factors Affecting

Physiological Function: Multiple forms of vitamin
B6, called vitamers, are found in body fluids. Foods or
dietary supplements may contain several forms. After
ingestion, any of the following forms may appear in
portal blood: pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (P-5-P or PLP),
pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN) and 4-pyridoxic acid
(4-PA) (Figure 2.6). This multiplicity of forms has been
given the collective name, “Vitamin B6.” Erythrocytes
have a high capacity for conversion of PL to the active
form PLP and they can retro-convert the phosphorylated
form to PL for export. Erythrocyte PLP content may help
to maintain tissue cofactor levels by release of PL following a meal with high vitamer content.72 The converting
enzyme, pyridoxal kinase, has a gene expression regulation for local PLP requirements that is widely distributed. Thus, while supplemental PLP is more effective for
a short term increase of plasma PLP, local conversions
may be of more importance for governing tissue cofactor
status.73 For vitamin B6 status assessment the requirement for local tissue conversions supports measuring
functional biochemical markers over plasma PLP levels.
Supplementation with 40 mg of vitamin B6 for three
days in a randomized placebo-controlled study produced increases of 10-, 50- and 100-fold of PLP, 4-PA
and PL, respectively. The concentrations remained at the
same levels for the entire 84 days of supplementation.73
The active cofactor form is PLP, formed by phosphorylation of PL. Reports of plasma concentrations of
vitamin B6 have generally been based on HPLC or enzyme stimulation methods that measure PLP. There are
approximately 60 enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism that require the active form PLP for their function; thus, vitamin B6 deficiencies lead to decreases in B6
dependent enzymes. Research has found that enzyme
activities are not affected equally because of differing
cofactor binding activities and variability in age.74 Other
PLP-requiring enzymes are needed for conversions of
carbohydrates and fats. Sensitive tests for the detection
of vitamin B6 are necessary because of the many factors
influencing its status (Table 2.5).

of homocysteine (Figure 2.7). The other nutrients,
vitamin B12 and folate, are also discussed. The B12-folate

sion of homocysteine to cysteine.78 Significant portions
of the population in developed countries carry a genetic
determinant that causes weaker cofactor binding to the
enzymes, cystathionine alpha-synthase and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Individuals
with defective enzymes require greater concentrations of
the coenzyme to achieve necessary enzyme activity levels
to protect from homocysteine accumulation.79 A limitation of homocysteine as a marker of B6 deficiency is its
lack of specificity, owing to the concurrent involvement
of B12- and folate-dependent enzymes.
Specific biochemical markers of functional vitamin B6
status are xanthurenate and kynurenate, which are organic
acids produced from tryptophan. The breakdown of these
three compounds depends on enzymes that function
only when PLP is bound.80 Inadequate PLP results in the
accumulation of these markers and spilling into urine;
thus their presence above normal limits in urine indicates
a vitamin B6 deficiency (Table 2.6).
Erythrocyte transaminase enzymes provide another
method for assessing vitamin B6 status. This sensitive
and specific assay has been frequently used in investigations of vitamin B6 status.81 Erythrocyte glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (EGOT) and glutamate-pyruvate

transminase (EGPT) activities decline with inadequate
intake of vitamin B6. Their activities can be restored in
the laboratory by the addition of PLP and the ratio of
the stimulated to unstimulated reaction rates provides a
reliable measure of vitamin B6 depletion (Table 2.6). One
reason this assay has not found wide clinical application
is its relative expense as a single nutrient marker. Plasma
PLP has been found to reflect tissue stores, though it is
slow to respond to changes in vitamin status and decreases with increasing protein intake and age.59

Physiological Function: Having the most complex
structure of all vitamins, vitamin B12 uniquely contains
an organometallic bond (Figure 2.8). All forms of vitamin B12 contain hexavalent cobalt as the central ion in
the corrin ring that forms the core of the molecule. Four
nitrogen atoms of the corrin ring and one from a side
group surround the cobalt ion. The sixth valence may be
occupied by a variety of ligands. During early purification work the cyanide group was picked up as the
sixth ligand leading to the cyanocobalamin form being
designated as “vitamin B12.” The cyanide form is easily
metabolized to active forms, although tobacco smoking
causes a displacement back to the inactive vitamin form
owing to chronic inhalation of low levels of cyanide. The
corrin ring is similar to the heme ring, but key structural
alterations dictate the highly specific and stable binding
of cobalt rather than iron.
Deficiency: Deficiencies of vitamin B12 result from
inadequate dietary intake or impaired absorption from
lack of intrinsic factor or insufficient gastric secretions.
Approximately 60% of B12 deficiency in elderly adults
was due to decreased absorption of protein bound
cobalamin.82 Because of the close relationship between
the biochemical role of vitamin B12 and folic acid, the
clinical and hematological results of deficiencies of the
two nutrients are indistinguishable. The relative time
scale for various manifestations of folate deficiency may
be applied similarly to vitamin B12.

Adult repletion: 100 to 1,000 µg/d

The detection of vitamin B12 deficiency raises other
questions regarding the metabolic impact and origin
of the deficiency. Patients receiving low dose aspirin
therapy are more likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency,
probably owing to the toxic effects of aspirin on the
gastric mucosa that cause decreased secretion of intrinsic
factor.83 In other patients, the accumulation of methylmalonic acid caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can
cause a disruption of normal glucose and glutamic acid
metabolism.84
Assessment of Status: Tests specific for vitamin
B12 measure serum concentration and urinary methylmalonate (MMA) excretion. Urine MMA is a measure
of functional adequacy, while serum concentration
measures the amount available for use. The distinction
is important because of the possibility that a “normal”
serum concentration may be inadequate to saturate
vitamin B12-requiring enzymes to carry out essential
metabolic functions in some individuals. Because of its
specificity and sensitivity, the test for methylmalonate
elevation has been called the gold standard for assessing
tissue vitamin B12 status (Table 2.7).85
Neonatal screening for elevated urinary MMA levels
reveals vitamin B12 deficiency in infants. Two cases of

have been reported, the mother being vegetarian in one
case and having pernicious anemia in the other.86 This
is an example of the use of metabolic testing to detect
preventable vitamin deficiency cases before the onset of
symptoms that might otherwise persist undetected for
many years.
Although the detection of elevated homocysteine
in plasma or urine is not as specific as methylmalonic
aciduria for vitamin B12 status, the increasing use of this
test as a screen for nutrient-related cardiovascular risk will
allow the discovery of many cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation in these
individuals may not only reduce cardiovascular risk but,
equally important, will allow the early correction of other
symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The Schilling
test, used to determine vitamin B12 deficiency owing to
malabsorption, is described in Chapter 7, “GI Function.”

Adult repletion: 2 to 20 mg/kg/d

Physiolgical Function: Tetrahydrobiopterin is not
a classically essential nutrient because it can be synthesized in human tissues from guanosine triphosphate
(GTP). BH4 has four primary functions. It is a cofactor
utilized by the rate-limiting enzymes responsible for the
hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids, which include
phenylalanine to tyrosine, tyrosine to DOPA and tryptophan to serotonin. It is also a cofactor in nitric oxide
production from arginine (see Figure 2.9).87,88
The rate of BH4 synthesis is important because
BH4 is so easily oxidized that its concentration may
limit BH4-dependent metabolic steps, thus producing
the clinical state of conditional BH4 insufficiency. All of
the biochemical functions described below are affected
when BH4 is low and they can respond to BH4 supplementation. Extensive work on the clinical use of BH4
has been done to ameliorate the devastating effects of
phenylketonuria.89
The first step in the synthesis of BH4 is governed
by the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH), where
GTP is converted to dihydroneopterin triphosphate
(Figure 2.9). Since diversion of guanosine from polynucleotide synthesis must be closely regulated, levels of
GTPCH are translationally controlled by many factors,
including estrogen.87, 90 GTPCH activity is also affected
by a negative feedback response from BH4 and positive
feedback response from phenylalanine.91 Dihydroneopterin triphosphate is then converted to 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin by the enzyme 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
synthase (PTPS).3 In PTPS deficiency the conversion

cannot take place and the formation of the pterin intermediate, neopterin, increases. Neopterin is a marker of
inflammation-induced cytokine production. It is simultaneously elevated with the quinolinic acid response to
interferon gamma.92, 93 6-Pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin is
converted through several steps involving three different
enzymes, sepiapterin reductase (SR), carbonyl reductase
(CR), aldose reductase (AR), culminating in the formation of BH4. BH4 is converted to pterin-4a-carbinolamine
during its cofactor functions. BH4 is needed in four
enzymatic reactions. It is a cofactor for phenylalanine-4-

hydroxylase (PAH) in the conversion of phenylalanine to
tyrosine, resulting in pterin-4a-carbinolamine. It is also
essential in the enzymatic reactions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), nitric oxide
synthase (NOS), which along with BH4, convert tyrosine
to DOPA, tryptophan to 5-OH-tryptophan and arginine
to citrulline, respectively. BH4 is then regenerated.88
Pterin-4a-carbinolamine is then dehydrated by the enzyme pterin-4 carbinolamine dehydrase (PCD) to q-dihydrobiopterin. Though rare, mild and transient, a PCD
deficiency leads to the accumulation of primapterin.

Guanosine triphosphate is the substrate for the enzyme GTPCH that starts the sequence of reactions for BH4 synthesis in
human tissues. Because of genetic polymorphic effects or toxic interferences, the rate of BH4 formation and recovery can
be insufficient to meet demands in some individuals. In these people one or more of the functions of BH4 (shown as parallel
pathways at the lower left) may be significantly impaired.

other conditions such as insulin sensitivity and vascular disease.100, 101 BH4 is obligatory for the activity of all
nitric oxide (NO) synthase isoforms and glyceryl-ether
mono-oxygenase. By its regulation of neuronal NO
synthase, BH4 is a neuroprotective factor. BH4 restriction limits proliferation of hematopoietic and other
mammalian cell lines. Low BH4 levels are also associated with impaired eNOS activity, leading to endothelial
dysfunction.102
Assessment of Status: Several markers can help
assess BH4 status and may need to be determined to accurately identify the location of a specific defect. These
markers include BH4 blood levels, 5HIAA, 5MTHF, HVA,
prolactine, pterins, Phe/Tyr ratio and Phe blood levels. A
BH4 loading test can aid in distinguishing BH4 deficiency
from classic PKU.91
Hyperphenylalaninemia arising from defects in BH4
biosynthesis or some forms of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency can respond to BH4 supplementation.
The current recommended dosage to maintain conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is 2 to 10 mg/kg body
weight.101 BH4 loading tests can be done to identify BH4
supplement responders by measuring the fall of phenylalanine following BH4 dosing. Phenylalanine levels will
decrease to normal levels 4 to 8 hours after a BH4 load in
those with a BH4 deficiency.91 Various factors may affect
the response, such as the type of hydroxylase deficiency,
individual response, dose and quality of supplement, as
well as the patient’s phenylalanine level.101 Loading tests
will not differentiate between defects in biosynthesis of
BH4 and phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme deficiency.
Testing of urinary pterins may be done to narrow the
possible causes of HPA (Table 2.8).91, 101, 103 Biopterin
levels were found to peak 1 to 4 hours following a 10
mg/kg load. Sublingual administration resulted in a 60%
higher plasma increase compared to oral.101

q-Dihydrobiopterin is reduced by dihydropterine
reductase (DHPR) to reform BH4. In a DHPR deficiency,
q-dihydrobiopterin is tautomized to biopterin.88, 94
BH4 can also be produced from a salvage pathway.
The salvage pathway starts at 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
and, with a nonezymatic reaction goes to sepiapterin,
which turns into 7,8-dihydrobiopterin. BH4 is then
produced via the reaction of dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR). Thus folic acid supplementation has been
shown to increase intracellular BH4 levels by stimulation
of DHFR.95-97
Deficiency: BH4 deficiencies can range from mild
to severe. In some instances enzymes may not form
properly and increased amounts of BH4 may be required.
Mutations have been found in several of the required enzymes including PTPS, SR, GTPCH and DHPR, although
alterations in PTPS are the most common.
BH4 deficiency due to autosomal recessive mutations, causing the metabolic conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine to be slowed with clinically significant
accumulation of phenylalanine oxidation products, is
recognized as a cause of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA),
including mild and severe forms of phenylketonuria
(PKU).98 Eighteen out of 40 infants with severe elevated
phenylalanine (> 240 microM) were found to be BH4
responsive. Treatment with BH4 (20 mg/kg/day) over a
period of 24 months significantly improved phenylalanine tolerance.99 The incidence of BH4 deficiency and
PKU varies according to national origin. In the United
States, BH4 deficiency accounts for less than 2% of PKU
cases, while in Saudia Arabia it is up to 66%.94 More on
each of these amino acid conversions can be found in
Chapter 4, “Amino Acids.”
Restricted BH4 cofactor availability has also been
suggested as an etiologic factor in neurological diseases,
including DOPA-responsive dystonia, Alzheimer disease,
Parkinson disease, autism and depression; as well as in

## Folic Acid
Active forms: Tetrahydrofolic acid or Tetrahydrofolate (THF), Folinic
acid (5-formylTHF), 5-MethylTHF, 5,10-MethyleneTHF, FormiminoTHF
Biochemical role: Single carbon (i.e. methyl group) transfer
Example: Homocysteine + MethylTHF = Methionine + THF
Deficiency tests: Homocysteine – plasma, Folate – serum, Folacin
– RBC, CBC – Macrocytic anemia, Neutrophil hypersegmentation

Physiological Function: Folate, also called pteroyl­
glutamic acid (PGA), is categorized as a B vitamin.
Folate is made up of three distinct parts, pterin, paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA) and glutamic acid (Figure
2.10). The pterin ring is conjugated to PABA and the
carboxyl group of PABA is bound to the alpha-amino
group of glutamate. Active folate has multiple glutamic
residues attached. Tetrahydrofolate (THF) is the active
form of folate and accepts single carbon atoms from
various catabolic reactions in amino acid metabolism.
Substituted folate can then donate the single carbon
groups in biosynthetic reactions. Many functions depend
on folate’s single carbon transfer ability. The reduction
of 5,10-methylene THF to 5-methyl THF produces the
cofactor necessary for the conversion of homocysteine
to methionine and ultimately for DNA production. THF
regenerates 5,10-methylene THF in a reaction that also
produces glycine from serine. THF can also convert to 5,10
methylene THF in other pathways as well (Figure 2.11).
Although we have all the components of the vitamin, humans do not synthesize folate. We do not have
the enzyme necessary for coupling the pterin molecule

Adult repletion: 200 to 800 µg/d

to PABA to form pteroic acid. Humans must obtain
folate from the diet. Folate in foods exists primarily as
pteropolyglutamates with up to nine glutamates. The
polyglutamate forms must be hydrolyzed to monoglutamate in order to be absorbed. Conjugase enzymes
required for the hydrolysis are zinc-dependent. Alcohol
and zinc deficiency impede folate absorption by inhibiting conjugase activity.
The dietary forms of folate are chemically reduced.
They frequently have one-carbon substitutions in the
pteridine ring and may have up to 10 additional glutamate residues linked to the proximal glutamic acid
moiety. Approximately 50 to 95% of folate is destroyed
during food processing such as canning.104, 105
Deficiency: Megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency is found in up to 5% of pregnant women
in developed countries.3 Since megaloblastic anemia is a
sign that develops long after biochemical lesions (Figure
2.12), functional folic acid deficiency may be present
in a larger than expected percentage of the population.
This rationale is supported by the variety of causes of
folic acid deficiency, including inadequate dietary intake,
impaired absorption, excessive tissue demands and
metabolic derangements and polymorphisims.106 Folate
deficiency is associated with conditions such as cancer,
IBD and Down syndrome, and is known to respond to
treatments.107-110 Since 1998 the FDA has mandated that
grains, flours and breads be fortified with folic acid.
However, this raises concern that a higher folate level
may mask a B12 deficiency, especially in
older adults.
Four more glutamyl residues attach here
to make pentaglutamyltetrahydrofolic acid.

Only methionine can serve as a direct supplier of methyl groups to form SAMe. If betaine is supplied from choline intake, then
the remethylation of homocysteine is facilitated in the liver. Catabolism of serine (1), glycine (2), histidine (3) and tryptophan
(4), however, contributes the bulk of total methyl and other single carbon units. The central triangle shows how the various
single carbon forms flow into an interchanging pool of methylene, methenyl and formyl units attached to folic acid (THF). The
step in which 5,10-Methylene-THF is reduced to 5-methyl-THF, however, is not reversible. If vitamin B12 or any of the steps
that utilize methyl-B12 are lacking, then folic acid can become trapped as 5-methyl-THF, constituting the “folate trap.”

Genetic polymorphisims in the MTHFR (methylene
THF reductase) gene may be a significant issue that
has been associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.111, 112 In terms of intervention options,
the clinical significance of identifying individuals with
the current single nucleotide polymorphism testing is

questionable since functional biomarkers like homocysteine lowering have not shown any greater response to
methyl-THF than to THF in positive individuals.113 Such
results indicate that the rate of 5,10-methylene THF
reduction is sufficient to sustain homocysteine methylation requirements, even in affected individuals.

hematological changes in the mother but are likely to
contribute to birth defects.114 A large epidemiologic
study found that in women consuming one or more
alcoholic drinks per day, the relative risk of breast cancer
was greatly increased for those in the lowest quintile of
plasma folate concentration, compared to those in the
highest.115

Assessment of Status: Homocysteine accumulation is a sensitive marker of folate inadequacy at the
biochemical level because of the great flux of metabolites
from methionine through homocysteine and cysteine
to supply the constant demand for glutathione. Since
elevated homocysteine is not necessarily owing to folate
deficiency, measurement of serum folate or urinary
FIGLU may be used as a confirmatory test.
Other signs appear at later stages in the succession
of steps whereby a biochemical pathway inefficiency
progresses to cellular malfunction and cell death and
finally to tissue failure. The most susceptible tissue is
bone marrow, again owing to the constant high demand
for replenishment of mature erythrocytes. Anemia is the
end-stage disease of the biochemical lesion resulting
from folate deficiency.
A serum folate concentration < 0.3 ng/ml is evidence of deficiency, but false normal values are frequently due to the response of serum levels to transient
dietary intake changes that do not correspond to tissue
repletion of the nutrient. There is a marked increase in
demand for the vitamin during the third trimester of
pregnancy. Short-term deficiencies may not produce

Erythrocyte folate may be used to evaluate deficiency, but the period of deficiency that must pass before
abnormal values are observed is longer than that causing elevated homocysteine. Leukocytes contain much
higher levels of folate, but the changes parallel those for
erythrocytes and, thus, are not valuable early markers of
deficiency (Table 2.9). Formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU)
is an intermediate in the degradation of histidine that
accumulates in the later stages of folate deficiency, especially when histidine is administered as an oral load (see
Chapter 6, “Organic Acids”).116

Of Further Interest…

Physiological Function: Biocytin, released from
biotin-containing proteins, is hydrolyzed to biotin and
lysine by biotinidase.7 The active form of biotin, biocytin, is linked to the amino group of enzymes that operate
in biochemical pathways of gluconeogenesis, fatty acid
synthesis and amino acid catabolism.117
Genetic variations in the enzymes involved in the
release and recovery of biotin contribute to a functional biotin deficiency state. Other factors operate
to modify the flow of biotin from the gut, including

Adult repletion: 500 to 5,000 µg/d

bacterial populations that can synthesize the nutrient
and the capacity for intestinal absorption. Because of the
many biochemical roles of biotin enzymes, the clinical
manifestations are highly varied. Early signs of biotin
deficiency in biotin depleted rats were abnormalities of
hair growth and skin integrity and impaired immune
function.118
Deficiency: Biotin is the B-complex vitamin most
dramatically affected by oral antibiotics. The reason is
two-fold. First, most foods are poor sources of biotin,
so a low intake is common. Exceptions are biotin-rich
foods: egg yolk, kidney, liver and some cheeses. Second, the bacteria of the healthy gut can produce biotin,
adding significantly to dietary supply.119 Thus, antibiotics can disrupt the biotin produced in the gut, but
dietary sources are not generally adequate to compensate
for this loss.
Assessment of Status: Evidence in support of a
functional marker of biotin adequacy has appeared only
relatively recently.120 Urinary elevation of alpha-hydroxy-isovalerate results from biotin failing to assist in
the degradation of a catabolic product of valine. Values
of alpha-hydroxyisovalerate above 15 µg/mg creatinine
in overnight urine indicate potential biotin deficiency.
Plasma biotin level is not a sensitive marker of biotin
status and has been shown to be resistant even with
clinical signs of deficiency.59, 121-124 Further discussion
of the biotin and alpha-hydroxyisovalerate relationship
may be found in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.”
Notes:

Biotin supplementation, along with chromium,
was found to help maintain glycemic control in a
double-blind case-study, N = 348. Participants taking
2 mg of biotin and 600 µg chromium picolinate had
statistically significant (P < .05) reductions of HbA1c
and glucose.253
It is thought that biotin improves abnormal
glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose-induced
insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, accelerating
glycolysis in the liver and pancreas, and enhancing
muscle insulin sensitivity.
Biotin is an enzyme cofactor for the following
carboxylases:
• Acetyl-CoA (fatty acid synthesis)
• Pyruvate (gluconeogenesis)
• Methylcrotonyl-CoA (leucine catabolism)
• Propionyl-CoA (MMA synthesis)

Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid and
Dehydroascorbic Acid)
Active form: Ascorbic acid
Biochemical role: Antioxidant, hydroxylation
Examples: Lysine-Collagen → alpha-Hydroxylysine-Collagen
Deficiency Tests: Vitamin C – serum, leukocyte

Physiological Function: Ascorbic acid is oxidized
to dehydroascorbic acid and ketogulonic acid. The conversion to dehydroascorbic acid is via the intermediate
semidehydroascorbate, a free radical with an unpaired
electron. The majority of ascorbic acid is converted
to dehydroascorbic acid.50 Dehydroascorbate can be
converted back to ascorbic acid, the reaction being gluta­
thione dependent. The ability to reverse back to ascorbic
acid from dihydroascorbate gives vitamin C its primary
property as a biological reductant. The conversion to
ketogulonic acid is irreversible (Figure 2.13).7 Vitamin C
is a powerful water soluble antioxidant for both intraand extra-cellular reactions and is heavily involved in
reactions with reduced iron and copper metallothione
enzymes. The synthesis of collagen (proline or lysine
hydroxylation), carnitine and neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptophan) require vitamin C
dependent enzymes.38, 50
Deficiency: Individual vitamin C requirements vary
significantly. In controlled human trials, early signs of

Adult Repletion: 1000 to 5000 mg/d

scurvy appeared when plasma ascorbic acid levels fell
below 0.3 mg/dl, while after 30 days of a diet deficient
in vitamin C, skin hemorrhages and emotional changes
had begun to occur.51 Most frequently associated signs of
deficiency were petechiae, gum changes, hyperkeratosis
and arthralgia.51, 125
Assessment of Status: Because of its short physiological half-life and chemical instability, vitamin C has
been considered one of the most problematic nutrients
to assess in terms of optimal intake for an individual,
though previous studies have found good stability of
whole blood and serum samples and assessments have
been successfully used in large cohort studies.126 Intake
must be relatively constant to maintain tissue levels in
a range where short-term effects on amino acid metabolism and long-term effects on collagen synthesis are
optimal. There are no functional biochemical markers
specific for vitamin C status. Most studies of vitamin C
have relied on serum or plasma levels that show a linear
relationship with intake over a limited range. Plasma
ascorbic acid reaches a maximum concentration at about
1.4 mg/dl. Further intake results in rapid renal clearance. With deprivation of vitamin C, plasma ascorbic
acid decreases rapidly and clinical signs of scurvy will
appear at continued levels of less than 0.2 mg/dl.127
Under controlled conditions, measurements of plasma,
tissue and urinary vitamin C in healthy patients on various doses of vitamin C reveal bioavailability and tissue

Example: Calcium-binding protein (CBP) synthesis
Deficiency tests: 25-hydroxyvitamin D – serum, Bone-specific
peptide – urine (indirect)
Adult repletion: 700 - 10,000 IU/d

Physiological Function: There are two primary
forms of vitamin D, vitamin D3 and vitamin D2. Vitamin
D3, or cholecalciferol, is formed in the skin upon UV
exposure. The other, vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, comes
from foods or supplements.136 The cholecalciferol form
of vitamin D comes from the conversion of 7-dehydroxycholesterol to previtamin D3 via UV radiation from
the sun (Figure 2.14). Previtamin D3 is then converted to
vitamin D3. Excess vitamin D cannot be achieved by sun
exposure because previtamin D3 and vitamin D3 become
photolyzed to inactive products when levels rise.137 After
binding to carrier proteins (such as vitamin D binding
protein or DBP), vitamin D3 is then transported to the
liver where it is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
The kidneys are stimulated by parathyroid hormone
(PTH) to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 from
circulating 25-hyroxyvitamin D levels. This conversion
can also take place in other cells and tissues (prostate,
colon, placenta, bone, macrophages, T-lymphocytes) via
cytokine signals.136 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulates
its effects based on blood calcium levels or physiologic
need.139 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enters the cells and
initiates transcription and translation, leading to protein
synthesis, which results in effects such as proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis.138 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 leads to the production of calcium binding protein
(CBP or osteocalcin) which regulates the active transport of calcium, via vitamin D-dependent absorption.136
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is responsible for increasing calcium and phosphorus in the blood via intestinal
absorption, bone resorption and renal tubular absorption in the kidney. When there is sufficient amounts of
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, its production will decrease
and the production of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 will
increase.136 The role of 24,25-dihyroxyvitamin D3 is not
yet fully defined.140

saturation. After keeping subjects on low vitamin C
intake for several weeks, such studies have demonstrated complete tissue uptake of doses up to 200 mg with
declining bioavailability at single doses above 500 mg.128
Owing to the high safety and low risk, many studies
have shown clinical effects at higher doses. For example,
young women who consume two 500 mg capsules of
ascorbic acid at breakfast were shown to have more
favorable lipoprotein profiles than controls.129
Large-scale investigations of mechanisms for cancer
prevention by vitamin C depend on reliable interlaboratory ascorbic acid (AA) concentration determinations.130
The National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) has prepared a standard reference material (SRM
970) at two AA concentrations in serum. Level I and
Level II of SRM 970 contain 10 and 30 umol/L AA, respectively. When seventeen independent laboratories using a variety of methods analyzed SRM 970 for total AA,
the results showed large variability.131 The availability of
SRM 970 should assist improvement of interlaboratory
reliability as methods can be more closely investigated
for sources of error.
Ascorbic acid disappears from urine early in the
process of depletion. Leukocyte levels fall more slowly
than plasma ascorbate and drop most dramatically only
when signs of scurvy appear. Determination of leukocyte
ascorbate has other drawbacks. The assay is technically
difficult and requires large volumes of blood. Improper
handling of the leukocytes will cause a loss of ascorbate
resulting in falsely low values. Also, ascorbic acid is an
extremely labile vitamin and extensive efforts must be
made to preserve the vitamin, especially in urine where
exposure to air increases the rate of oxidation.
Claims of correlation of ascorbic acid tissue saturation and the rate of disappearance of the intradermally
injected dye, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, or the disappearance of the dye after topical application to the tongue
have been shown to be invalid.132-135

Figure 2.14 — Metabolism of Vitamin D
In the skin, ultraviolet rays are required to convert 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Industrial
production starts with ergosterol to produce vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) that is added to foods or sold as a nutritional
supplement. Both forms are metabolized to their respective 25-hydroxy circulating forms and 1,25-dihydroxy active forms
that have similar biological activity. The difference lies in the faster rate of clearance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2. Vitamin D2
is absorbed by the gut and follows a pathway similar to vitamin D3. Thus, unless otherwise noted 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a
combination of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2.

intoxication was accompanied with a serum 25-hydroxy­
vitamin D level > 220 nmol/L.* However, not all the
high doses were associated with intoxication and levels
of 225 nmol/L have been achieved by sunshine exposure alone.162 Levels of 135 to 225 nmol/L have been
found to be normal in sunny climates.164 Other research
showed no harmful effects at levels of 250 nmol/L.165 An
acute toxic dose in adults is not well established, though
the potentially toxic dose is significantly lower for very
young children. In a double-blind, placebo controlled
study, girls ages 10 to 17 were given 14,000 IU/week
(2,000 IU/day) for 1 year without adverse consequences.166
Toxicity is generally only expected to be a problem in
those taking large doses and in those who already have
adequate or high levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D of 250 nmol/L has been shown to
be a cut off for a toxic concentration.163, 165, 167
Supplement doses of vitamin D to achieve recommended 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels vary between
individuals. Intakes of 700 to 1,000 IU/day have been
shown to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of
90 to 100 nmol/L in 50% of adult populations,143 while
younger adults may need higher intakes. Levels of 4,000
to 10,000 IU of vitamin D were found to be safe in
younger adults.143 In regards to the type of supplement,
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) has been found to be more
efficacious than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). In a study
comparing the effectiveness of the two forms, both were
found to produce a similar rise in serum levels.168 However, vitamin D3 had a more sustained peak that was
still visible on day 14, whereas vitamin D2 returned to

Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, undergoes reactions
similar to the D3 pathway. It goes from ergosterol, to
ergocalciferol, to 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and then to the
final active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2.
Beyond osteoporosis, negative health effects of
vitamin D insufficiency include strong influences on the
development of cancer and autoimmune diseases, such
as insulin-dependent diabetes and multiple sclerosis.141
Research has also found a relationship with maternal
vitamin D intake and childhood illness. In a study of
1,212 mother-child pairs, children of mothers with
higher vitamin D intakes had lower rates of early childhood wheezing illnesses.142
Deficiency: There is growing concern over the
occurrence of poor vitamin D status.143-147 Some prominent vitamin D researchers have identified vitamin D
deficiencies as a pandemic.148-152 Vitamin D deficiencies
are more common in those with limited sun exposure, a
low intake of vitamin D, impaired absorption owing to
kidney or digestive diseases, or older adults who have
a decreased ability to synthesize this vitamin from the
sun.136, 153 UV exposure is the primary source of vitamin
D for most people.137 Many populations are showing
alarming rates of deficiencies.
Research revealed 41% of U.S. outpatients aged
49 to 83 had low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels. The level is higher in European studies148.154 In
the first year of institutionalization, almost all elderly
people are at risk of becoming deficient in vitamin D.56
A cause of the reemergence of rickets is due to extended
breastfeeding without adequate sunlight or vitamin D
supplementation.155 Dietary factors other than vitamin D
intake and sun exposure may affect vitamin D status. In
a large multi-country study, higher calcium intake was
associated with greater fracture rates.156 Excessive animal
protein157, 158 or calcium intake159, 160 can cause lower
blood levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by affecting the
rates of its formation and clearance.
Cases requiring massive doses of vitamin D to
achieve normal 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels have been
reported.161 Such cases illustrate the range of individual
requirements for vitamin D. Studies giving 10,000
IU/day to adults for up to five months found no toxic
effects.162 A short term whole body sun exposure is
reported to provide the equivalent of 10,000 to 20,000
IU/day of vitamin D3.162, 163 In a review of pharmacological doses ranging from 20,000 IU to 600,000 IU
of vitamin D for 3 months to over 20 years, vitamin D

vitamin D in plasma.173 Researchers have thus identified
the need to standardize vitamin D measurements.174
Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is FDA approved and thus the
current recommended testing procedure.175, 176 Detection of individual 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 can currently only be done using LC/MS/MS. Though not FDA
approved, this method is accurate when performed by
experienced personnel using a validated procedure.176
Many markers may be seen in a vitamin D deficiency state. Severe deficiency of vitamin D indirectly
causes increased serum activity of alkaline phosphatase
because of the role of this enzyme in bone mineralization. Alkaline phosphatase is also under the influence of
a variety of factors, including several disease processes,3
zinc status,177 and vitamin C.178 The calcium binding
protein, osteocalcin, is secreted by osteoblasts and its
serum concentration is elevated in a number of conditions associated with high bone turnover. Osteocalcin,
however, is not as sensitive a marker of bone turnover as
serum alkaline phosphatase in Paget’s disease.179 A part
of this lack of sensitivity may be the co-dependence on
vitamin K status for osteocalcin formation. In elderly
females with vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with increased serum osteocalcin levels, which indicates increased bone formation.
These conditions might contribute to the bone disease
of geriatric patients.180 Other measurements that reflect
vitamin D deficiency are low urinary calcium excretion,
low serum calcium and phosphorus. Table 2.11 identifies some possible markers that may be modified with a
vitamin D deficiency.153
The process of bone formation is under complex
control by several factors, only one of which is vitamin D.
Assays of collagen peptide markers for bone loss161, 181

baseline by day 14.168 Other research showed oral vitamin D3 to be about 1.7 times more efficient than vitamin
D2 for raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D.168,169 There is
some reason for concern over excessive intake of vitamin
D owing to effects on vascular calcification,170 especially
for individuals who frequently consume milk products.
Although the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney controls
plasma levels of the active hormone, which then control
calcium absorption, other tissues carry out the conversion apparently to satisfy their own vitamin D demands.
It has been proposed that the level of circulating 25hydroxyvitamin D that satisfies bone formation may
be lower than the concentration needed for adequate
supply in extrarenal tissues, such as the prostate, colon
and skin. By this rationale, many have proposed that
an acceptable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be
higher than currently recommended. Estimation of the
optimal 25-hydroxy vitamin D level for multiple health
outcomes has been estimated to be 90-100 nmol/L.143
The health benefits associated with vitamin D were
noted to begin at approximately 75 nmol/mL and
previous research has shown calcium absorption to
decrease when 25-hydroxyvitamin levels fall below
80 nmol/mL.141, 143, 163 Table 2.10 summarizes clinical
indications of serum vitamin D levels.

Assessment of Status: The most frequently used
assay for vitamin D assessment of status is serum 25hydroxyvitamin D, a combination of both D3 (cholecalciferol) and D2 (ergocalciferol). 25-hydroxyvitamin D is
the primary circulating form of vitamin D and the most
reliable indicator of its status.139 It is the most abundant
metabolite of the vitamin and is the direct precursor of
the active form.
Two common measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D are enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA)171 or radio­
immunoassay (RAI).172 Improved chromatographic techniques may allow routine analysis of multiple forms of

## Vitamin E (Tocopherol)
Active forms: RRR alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-Tocopherol;
alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-Tocotrienol
Biochemical role: Antioxidant, especially membrane and plasma
lipoprotein protection
Example: Protection of low-density lipoprotein from oxidation
Deficiency tests: Tocopherol, tocopherol/triglyceride – serum,
Adult repletion: 200 to 1,600 IU/d

Physiological Function: Vitamin E can come
in the form of tocopherol and tocotrienol. Vitamin E
has a phytl side chain and a chroman ring. The position of methyl groups on the chroman ring determines
the type of tocopherol—alpha, beta, delta or gamma
(Figure 2.15). There are some important structural
considerations among forms of vitamin E for supplementation. There are three chiral carbons in the tocopherol structure. This means that eight optical isomers
are possible. The most abundant naturally occurring
stereoisomer of alpha-tocopherol has all three chiral
carbons in the R configuration and it is called RRRgamma-tocopherol. The name is frequently shortened
to gamma-tocopherol.The totally synthetic vitamin
E, obtained without any control of stereochemistry, is
a mixture in unspecified proportions of four pairs of
enantiomers (i.e. eight diastereoisomers). Such a totally
racemic mixture is called all-rac-alpha-tocopherol. Refer
to Table 2.15 for relative activities of the principle forms
of vitamin E.
Tocopherol acetate has twice the biological activity
of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol.183 Intestinal absorption does
not discriminate between the isomeric forms described
above. However, hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) selectively transfers alpha-tocopherol to
newly secreted VLDL particles.184 Standard clinical laboratory methods do not discriminate between the various
optical isomers. Because of the specificity in the action
of alpha TTP, however, plasma concentrations preferentially reflect intake and status of alpha-tocopherol.
Tocotrienols (TCT) are another class of vitamin E
analogs. They differ from tocopherols because their phytl
side chains contain 3 double bonds (Figure 2.16). Tocotrienols modulate several mechanisms associated with the
aging process. This class may suppress reactive oxygen
species damage more efficiently than the tocopherols,
lowering cholesterol levels, preventing cell adhesion to
endothelial cells, suppressing tumor growth and reducing
glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.185 Orally administered

are described under the calcium section of Chapter 3,
“Minerals.” Urinary or plasma proline and hydroxyproline elevations are also found in individuals with
increased bone turnover resulting from inadequate
calcium supply (see Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”). Iron
deficiency can lower 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, possibly
by impairing small intestinal absorption and may need
to be included in an overall assessment.182
Vitamin D levels (along with calcium and PTH activity) impact the rate of absorption of phosphorus from
the intestines. The majority of phosphorus is absorbed
from the intestines, although the rate depends somewhat
on the levels of calcium and vitamin D and the activity of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Calcium tends to
follow phosphorus. Thus for every gram of phosphorus
ingested in the diet, the body must match that with
another gram of calcium. If the calcium is not available
in the diet, the body will pull it from the bones. The
biggest concern with those eating a chronically low calcium, high-phosphorus standard American diet is a low
calcium/phosphorus ratio leading to a consistently high
PTH level which can then cause increased bone turnover
and decreased bone density.139

Figure 2.15 — Structures and Relative Activities of Tocopherols (TCP)
Tocopherols contain a chroman ring and a phytyl group. The presence of methyl groups at the 1 and 3 positions (circled in
red) of the chroman ring characterizes the a, b, g, and d isomers. The chroman ring gives vitamin E its antioxidant capabilities
via its hydroxyl group, which can donate a hydrogen radical. The phytyl group anchors the vitamin in lipids, such as lipid
membranes, lipoprotein and tissue lipids. The biological activity varies depending on the form of tocopherol. Some unique
biological properties of g-tocopherol are related to the negative (nucleophilic) character of the number 5 ring carbon.

tocotrienols appear in plasma at a maximum concentration within about 4 hours.186
Deficiency: Vitamin E is transported in plasma
in the lipoproteins and it serves as the most important
membrane protective antioxidant and free radical scavenger in the body.187 Although alpha-tocopherol is the
major component in foods and human tissues, the beta,
delta and gamma isomers are sometimes included in
profiles to show detail of tissue composition.
Experimental vitamin E deficiency is difficult to
produce in humans because of the intricate system of
checks and balances in the antioxidant cascade. Although symptoms of vitamin E deficiency are subtle,
many clinical effects are well documented. Cancer,

Figure 2.16 — Structure of Tocotrienol (TCT)

Physiological Function: Vitamin K is a fat soluble
vitamin that primarily acts as a cofactor in blood coagulation and bone matrix proteins. It is made up of a
quinone and a phytyl group. The biochemical action dependent on vitamin K involves unique gamma-carboxylation of glutamyl residues of specific proteins. The result
of the carboxylation is increased binding of calcium
that is known to be required in blood clot formation
and bone remodeling.191 There are two natural forms
of vitamin K which differ based on their phytyl group,
phylloquinone, synthesized from plants and menaquinone, synthesized from bacteria.
Deficiency: Vitamin K deficiency results in an
increase in the time required for blood to clot. The usual
clinical manifestation is a tendency to hemorrhage. The
measurement of prothrombin time in plasma reveals
the vitamin K-dependent activation of prothrombin and
other clotting factors. Prothrombin times longer than 12
seconds can indicate vitamin K deficiency (Table 2.12).
Vitamin K status is especially important in the elderly
because of inadequate dietary intake and absorptive
difficulties, frequently complicated by drug therapies.
Monitoring vitamin K can help reduce osteoporotic
bone fractures by identifying individuals whose bone
loss is due to vitamin K deficiency.192, 193 Calcium loss in
such cases can be reduced by up to 50% with vitamin K
supplementation.194
Assessment of Status: Methods for direct measurement of vitamin K concentration in blood or urine
have been reported.195 Human subjects placed on a low
vitamin K diet for several weeks show variable declines
in body pools of vitamin K from normal values of
~1.0 µg/kg body weight. During dietary restriction, fecal

hypertriglyceridemia have elevated levels of lipoproteins,
vitamin E concentrations also tend to rise, leading to
overestimation of vitamin E total body status. The ratio
of measured tocopherol to triglycerides in plasma or
serum may be calculated as a way of correcting for this
effect. Vitamin E deficiency is indicated when the ratio
of serum tocopherol to total lipids is less than 0.8 mg/g
in lipid extracts of serum. Because of the ease of simultaneous analysis, vitamins A, E and beta-carotene and
coenzyme Q10 are frequently reported as a profile of
fat-soluble vitamins. Concentrations of these vitamins
in serum are measured by high performance liquid
chromatography.23, 189, 190

Tocotrienols differ from tocopherols because their phytl
side chains contain three double bonds (circled in blue).
Isomeric variations similar to tocopherols occur with
methyl group removals.

Notes:

excretion of an administered dose of vitamin K falls, but
urinary excretion rises, indicating activation of intestinal
absorption mechanisms.196 The more clinically relevant
question of body pool size calls for measures of functional status that are becoming available. Radioimmunoassay for undercarboxylated osteocalcin and measureTable 2.12 — Vitamin K Tests

ment of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) in urine are two ways
to see whether the biochemical functions of the vitamin
are adequate (Table 2.12). These markers are sensitive
indicators of vitamin K status.197
Binding of calcium is critical for the function of the
sequence of reactions leading to blood clotting and the
change from native to calcium-binding clotting factor structures requires vitamin K (Figure 2.17). High
affinity calcium binding sites are generated when an
additional carboxylic acid group is added to glutamyl
residues. Multiple proteins of the blood clotting cascade have sites for the carboxylation reaction shown by
the red regions of the protein chains in the bottom of
Figure 2.17. Prothrombin is also known as Factor II,
thus it is the protein “inactivated” by vitamin K in the
“protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II”
(PIVKA-II) assay used to reveal vitamin K status.198-200
The term PIVKA-II can be confusing since one might say
that the carboxylation reaction during the physiological
process of blood coagulation is an activation rather than
inactivation of prothrombin. A less confusing alternate
name, des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin, is sometimes
used. The undercarboxylated osteocalcin assay is based
on the same concepts as the PIVKA-II assay.
The progression of PIVKA-II results to elevated values
with each trimester of pregnancy has led to the suggestion that some women develop a sub-clinical vitamin K
deficiency during gestation.201 Such women will have
difficulty maintaining calcium homeostasis while breast
feeding. Some tumors produce PIVKA-II, including gastric cancer202 and hepatocellular carcinoma.203, 204

Figure 2.18 — Carnitine and Beta-oxidation

Fatty acids are converted to fatty acyl-carnitine for transport
across the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Carnitine
then ‘flips’ the fatty acid through the membrane to the
inside of the mitochondria. Enzymes oxidize fat into ATP,
carbon dioxide, and water. Carnitine is recycled back
outside the mitochondira. When carnitine is not available
fatty acids undergo w-oxidation, and adipate, suberate, or
ethylmalonate will accumulate. See figure 5.5 in Chapter 5,
“Fatty Acids,” for greater detail.

Mitochondria
CPT I - Carnitine acyl-transferase I
CPT II - Carnitine acyl-transferase II
CT - Carnitine acyl-transferase

Physiological Function: The action of carnitine
may be described as a key that opens the gate of energy
flow in most cells (Figure 2.18). The main function of
carnitine is to transport fatty acids across the mitochrondrial membrane for fatty acid oxidation, with the notable
exception of brain tissue. The enzymes of this pathway
reside inside the mitochondria. Fatty acids, however,
must gain entry to the mitochondria by forming fatty
acyl-carnitine esters in the mitochondrial trans-membrane space. Limitation of carnitine can slow the process
of transfer and therefore the overall energy yielding
system. Skeletal and cardiac tissues rely on fatty acid
oxidation and therefore have a high concentration of
carnitine. The need for and supplementation of carnitine has been studied in many areas, including human
metabolism, cardiovascular disease, sports enhancement,
peripheral artery disease, diabetes, aging, immunity, HIV,
thyroid function, cancer, infertility and others.205
Deficiency: Carnitine is a water-soluble compound
that is abundant in animal muscle tissue, including red
meats (Latin: carne). Carnitine is synthesized from lysine
and therefore, it is not strictly classified as an essential
nutrient. Evidence of its conditional essentiality comes
from the finding of low plasma carnitine in patients on
long-term total parenteral nutrition.205 Skeletal muscle
myopathy has been successfully treated with carnitine.206
Measurement of acyl- and free carnitine is used to detect
secondary carnitine deficiencies in certain inborn errors of organic acid metabolism.207 Many of the toxic
effects of chronic alcoholism that result from glutathione
depletion are reduced by administration of carnitine.208
Carnitine has been advocated as a “mitochondrial megavitamin” therapy for adult onset diabetes.246
Assessment of Status: Functional carnitine
deficiency is revealed by elevated urinary excretion
of adipic, suberic and ethylmalonic acids,247 and is

described in more detail in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.”
Impairment of fatty acid oxidation is accompanied by
high levels of these urinary organic acids, as reported in
Reye-like syndrome248 and other mitochondrial impairment disorders.249 Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
disorders have been considered rare in the past, though
research is now finding milder forms. Mild forms of
short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies can be
identified via urinary ethylmalonic acid excretion.209, 210

Endurance exercised rats showed increases of CoQ10
in heart and skeletal muscle out of proportion with the
changes in other electron transport system components,
indicating a direct role of the coenzyme in regulation of
mitochondrial capacity for forming ATP.251 There also
may be a role of CoQ10 as an antioxidant, independent
of its function in mitochondrial electron transport.252
Deficiency: Research has identified CoQ10 as a
conditionally essential nutrient. It is found in significant
amounts in all nutrient-dense foods. Plants contain a
slightly different compound that may serve the electron transport function in animals, though with lower
efficiency. Patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy owing to electron transport complex I and IV
deficiencies show improved mitochondrial function and
an increased capacity for fat metabolism when supplemented with 150 mg/d of CoQ10.211 Lactate and pyruvate
elevations are reduced in patients with mitochondrial
myopathy when they are given daily oral doses of
120 mg of CoQ10.212 In a more recent case described
as primary deficiency of CoQ10, an 11-year-old male
displayed insidious onset of exercise intolerance and

Physiological Function: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10),
also called ubiquinone, is a quinone with an isoprenoid
side chain (Figure 2.19). The number of side chains determines the type of coenzyme. The primary function of
CoQ10 is to shuttle electrons through the electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondrial inner membrane.
This pathway is also referred to as the oxidative phosphorylation part of the central energy pathway. The electrons are received directly from succinate and choline, or
indirectly from several other substrates such as, pyruvate,
acyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate. CoQ10 moves from
one electron carrier complex to the other to ultimately
deliver electrons to oxygen, one at a time, in a never-ending cycle of oxidation and reduction (Figure 2.20).
While the electrons are delivered one at a time, they
leave in pairs to form ATP and H20. If CoQ10 availability
is not adequate, the electrons will not be able to travel in
pairs and single electrons will take another, less desirable, pathway that can lead to the generation of superoxide radicals. Optimal functioning of this pathway
is critical for the fundamental energy generation that
powers all cell functions.
The tissue that has the largest, most critical energy demand —the heart—will first show effects of
conditional deficiency of the coenzyme. Preoperative
oral CoQ10 therapy (300 mg/d) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery increased myocardial and cardiac
mitochondrial CoQ10 levels, improved mitochondrial
efficiency and increased myocardial tolerance to in vitro
hypoxia-reoxygenation stress. Average serum CoQ10 levels in this experiment for the control and supplemented

Figure 2.20 — Relationship of Coenzyme Q10 to Oxidizing Pathways

The metabolic intermediates shown entering the pathway originate from dietary fat, carbohydrate and protein. The
electron transfer that terminates energy-yielding pathways must be processed through the CoQ10 shuttle. CoQ10 moves
from one electron carrier complex to the other ultimately delivering electrons to oxygen, one at a time. Even transient, mild
insufficiency of CoQ10 can impair the massive mitochondrial electron transfer process, allowing single electrons to spill onto
other acceptors that can initiate free radical pathologies.

weight loss and muscle cramps in his lower extremities.
Abnormalities in organic acids and respiratory chain

300 mg/d.213
Assessment of Status: The clinical interpretation
of abnormal serum CoQ10 levels may be enhanced by
simultaneous measurement of markers that monitor
biosynthetic and functional roles of the cofactor. CoQ10
synthesis is dependent on the availability of hydroxymethylglutarate (HMG). Thus, if HMG is low it will
slow the rate of CoQ10 synthesis. Statin drugs block the
conversion of HMG to cholesterol and to CoQ10. HMG
accumulates and spills in urine at abnormally high levels
that signals reduced CoQ10 biosynthesis (Table 2.13).
Impairment of the synthetic pathway does not
necessarily mean functional impairment. A functional
impairment at the level of mitochondrial CoQ10 electron
transfer will also affect succinate, malate, fumarate and
pyruvate, which are the energy pathway intermediates.
CoQ10 deficiency causes elevation of these intermediates.
The direct transfer of electrons from succinate to the
FMN reductase enzyme in the electron transport system
is slowed when the electron shuttle action of CoQ10

is inadequate to meet demands. Chapter 12, “Pattern
Analysis.” presents further detail about the interpretation of multiple profile data for vitamins and the other
nutrient classes covered here.

Notes:

Lipoic Acid (Thioctic Acid)
Active forms: R-a-lipoic acid; dihydrolipoic acid
Biochemical role: Keto acid dehydrogenase cofactor and
glutathione recycling
Example: Pyruvate ➔ Acetyl-CoA + CO2 GSH ➔ GSSG
Deficiency Tests: Elevation of urinary lactate, pyruvate, branchedchain a-keto acids, a-ketoglutarate
Adult Repletion: 100 to 1,800 mg/d

Physiological Function: Lipoic acid is a disulfide
compound that contains a chiral center and thus has
two enantiomers, or mirror images. Lipoic acid can also
be reduced to dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) (Figure 2.21).
As a primary component of the lipoyl subunits, lipoic

acid is required to carry out oxidative decarboxylation
reactions catalyzed by several alpha-keto acid enzyme
complexes—pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, (KGDC), the branched-chain
alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD)—as
well as for the glycine cleavage system (GCS).214-216
Besides its function in dehydrogenase activities, it is also
a powerful antioxidant that has been found to quench
reactive oxygen species. It functions as a recycler of
endogenous antioxidants, like glutathione and vitamin
C.217, 218 Promising research with supplemental lipoic
acid has been conducted on hepatic injury, HIV, glaucoma, cancer, CVD, Alzheimer disease and diabetes
complications.219-225
Lipoic acid comes primarily from dietary sources.
It is highest in animal tissues, with a smaller percentage
found in fruits and vegetables.226 It can also be synthesized de novo in the mitochondria from the fatty acid
octanoic acid (caprylic acid) and cysteine, by way of
lipoic acid synthase.217, 227, 228
Deficiency: R-alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is conditionally essential, illustrated by its ability to increase insulin
sensitivity in diabetics after short-term (10 d or less)
parenteral administration.229 Oral administration of
alpha-lipoic acid has also been shown to improve insulin
sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes, as well as
lowering their serum lactate and pyruvate levels.230 The
mechanism of this effect appears to be direct stimulation
of glucose uptake. Both basal and insulin-stimulated
glucose transport is stimulated by addition of ALA to
cell cultures of adipocytes.231
Assessment of Status: The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate and branched-chain
alpha-keto acids requires lipoic acid as a cofactor.226 These
enzymes are multi-subunit complexes.232 Genetic differences in the lipoyl-containing subunit can affect the metabolic
activity of all three enzymes. An insufficient or deficient
amount of lipoic acid, as well as genetic polymorphism
in the lipoyl-containing subunit can cause insufficient
function of these enzymes, leading to elevated pyruvate,
branched-chain alpha-keto acids, alpha-ketoglutarate and
lactate.232, 233 The activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex (PDC) has been shown to be reconstituted by addition of ALA,234 yet some research has suggested that high
doses (600 mg) of lipoic acid can inhibit the PDC and lead
to an elevated lactate.216 In type 2 diabetes patients, elevations of urinary pyruvate and lactate have been normalized
by 600 mg of ALA twice daily.230

must look at the interrelationship of all of these nutrients.59 The best marker of dietary choline intake is
liver phosphocholine. Plasma choline levels range from
7 to 20 µmol/L, with an average of 10 µmol/L. Plasma
levels may not be stable enough to use in assessing

Choline supplements come in two forms—choline

as a choline supplement.59 Diets with high lecithin content can double plasma choline concentrations.245 Food
databases are limited in their ability to evaluate choline
intake, though 730 to 1,040 mg/day has been estimated
to be the average U.S. intake.59

Notes:

Physiological Functions: Choline has three methyl
groups (Figure 2.22) that are available for transfer to
homocysteine or tetrahydrofolate. Choline is essential
for cell membrane structure and signaling; as a methyl
donor via betaine; as a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine);
a precursor to phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and
sphingomyelin); and in the metabolism and transport of
cholesterol and lipids.59, 235 Thus it is not surprising that
choline has been studied for the treatment of dementia,
heart disease and cancer.59, 236-238
Although choline can be synthesized in human
tissues by methylation of glycine, there are many conditions that limit the rate of synthesis, making choline a
conditionally essential nutrient.236 Deficiencies of folic
acid, vitamin B12 and methyl donor compounds increase
the potential for choline insufficiency. Lack of availability of the precursor amino acid glycine can limit choline
biosynthesis as described in Chapter 4, “Amino Acids.”
Deficiency: Reports of requirements for choline
come primarily from studies of choline depleted diets,
especially those with adequate methionine, B12 and
folate. Maternal reserves of choline are depleted during
pregnancy and lactation.239 Dietary deficiency of choline
reduces hippocampal release of acetylcholine in rats.240
Such effects may explain the beneficial effects found for
CDP-choline (cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine) supplementation in elderly patients with cognitive deficits, inefficient memory and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.241
The primary marker of deficient choline is liver
damage, identified by elevated alanine aminotransferase
(ALT). Choline deficiencies have been found to induce
apoptosis in rat cells.59, 242 Excessive choline supplementation can lead to a fishy body odor, gastrointestinal
disturbances, sweating and salivation. Large doses of
choline may be contraindicated for those with renal and
liver disease, trimethylaminuria, depression and Parkinson disease. Methotrexate has been shown to decrease
choline levels and administration of choline has been
shown to decrease liver damage caused by the drug.59, 243
Assessment of Status: Though choline can be
synthesized endogenously, much of the body’s demand

## Summary

tory proteins. This chapter has reviewed the biochemistry and physiology, assessment and repletion of a variety
of essential and conditionally essential vitamins.
Assessment tools include direct measurement in
blood, challenge or loading tests, ratios, related hormones, cellular assays, enzyme assays and measurements
of amino acid precursors in urine or blood. Direct measurement of vitamins in specimens such as serum reveals
circulating concentrations. Functional markers can
further inform the practitioner whether circulating levels
of a given vitamin are adequate to sustain an individual’s
metabolic demand for the vitamin.

Deficiencies or even mild insufficiencies of vitamins
can result in a wide range of negative consequences
for human health. Even in developed countries, where
protein and caloric intake may be adequate, humans
can become depleted owing to low dietary intake, poor
digestion and absorption of nutrients from an otherwise
“healthy” diet, increased cellular demands for a given
nutrient, or medications that affect the absorption or
catabolism of vitamins. Genetic factors can also be revealed by abnormalities in laboratory tests of metabolic
function owing to effects on enzyme activities or regula-

Fat-soluble Vitamin Supplementation Pattern

This pattern was found in a 52-year-old
man, suffering from cardiovascular disease
who had been taking daily oral supplements of vitamins A, E and CoQ10 for
several months. Note that, in spite of high
antioxidant vitamin levels in serum, he
still has elevated lipid peroxides indicating risk of further degeneration owing to
oxidative challenge. v

Vitamin D Measurement to Avoid Insidious Bone Loss
25-hydroxyvitamin D

A 32-year-old female scheduled a routine office visit with
no current health problems. Her serum vitamin D level
was found to be very low. Left without the simple and
inexpensive supplementation with vitamin D, this pattern
foretells chronic bone loss that is generally insidious for
decades before incidents of fracture or diagnostic bone
scan techniques reveal bone loss that is difficult to reverse,
not to mention increased risks of depression and immune

dysregulation. Thus, this type of patient presents opportunity
for the clinically optimal intervention that can result in total
avoidance of major degenerative diseases. The test result
provides evidence on which to base aggressive vitamin D
supplementation for several months with follow up testing to
demonstrate normalization of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentration. v
