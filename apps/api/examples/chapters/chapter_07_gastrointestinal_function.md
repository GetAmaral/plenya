Gastrointestinal
Impact on Nutrient and
Toxicant Status

lymphatic tissue is located in the gut, and the gastrointestinal system is the only organ system of the body with
its own independently working lymphatic and nervous
systems. Only a system of prime importance to overall
health would have such a large number of total-body
resources dedicated to it.2-6
Failures of the gastrointestinal system manifests
as various digestive diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GED), irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic

Proper gastrointestinal (GI) function is critical to
adequate nutritional status and can impact all aspects of
body function. Approximately one-third of daily caloric
expenditure is required to drive the digestive, assimilative and immune functions while maintaining the
gastrointestinal tract.1 A large amount of the body’s total

GI Function

food through the gut at a pace slow enough to allow
for proper absorption, but fast enough to continuously
bring new nutrients as needed by the body. Digestive secretions, formed principally in response to the presence
of food in the GI tract, vary according to the amount
and type of food present. The amount of each digestive
secretion must be accurately modulated to provide just
the amount required for proper digestion. The nervous
system that regulates these activities (the enteric nervous
system) is to a large degree independent of the brain,
although it responds to signals from the sensory organs
and the immune system.
Large amounts of digestive secretions are required
to process the kilograms of food consumed daily. Based
on a typical dietary composition of 55% carbohydrate,
15% protein and 30% fat, a standard 2000 calorie
diet delivers 275 g, 75 g, and 67 g, respectively of the
macronutrients plus 2 or more liters of water. Establishing a clear picture of a patient’s functional adequacy
for extracting usable nutrients from the mass of food
is a challenge for which laboratory evaluations offer
only partial assistance. The principal difficulty is that
direct sampling of intestinal contents is impractical for
routine clinical practice. Analysis of specimens such as
peripheral blood, urine and feces may give results that
indirectly reflect difficulties with digestion and absorption. Due to the critical role of the gastrointestinal tract
in nutrient supply, even partial answers can be of great
value. Invasive procedures for observation or luminal
specimen retrieval can be highly informative, but they
can be performed only by trained specialists and are
often expensive and uncomfortable. Such procedures
are beyond the scope of this book. This chapter will deal
with non-invasive laboratory evaluations of gastrointestinal function as summarized in Table 7.1.

steatohepatitis (NASH) and colorectal cancer.7–9
Disorders of atopic immune origin, such as allergy
and asthma, or of autoimmune dysfunction, such
as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, autism and
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can originate in gastrointestinal
disturbances.10–12 Morbidity and mortality from these
diseases can be reduced by identification of antecedent
gastrointestinal dysfunction.
Every disorder that pertains to the gut has the
potential to manifest as a factor in nutritional deficiencies. The tests described in this chapter reveal the
functional status of the organs required for the digestion
and assimilation of food and some of the toxicologic
and immunologic consequences of failure to properly
carry out those functions. The subjects of leaky gut and
the associated immunologic challenge are discussed
with special reference to ways of testing for clinically
relevant factors. Testing also is discussed relevant to
stomach, pancreatic, hepatic and intestinal function.
The detection of abnormal microbial growth within the
gut and the impact of the various toxins produced by
their growth is an important and relatively new aspect of
gastrointestinal assessment, especially in the analysis of
urinary compounds that reveal the presence of various
classes of microbes.
From our embryologic beginnings, the inside
surface of our mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestines—everything we call our digestive tract—is
contiguous with the outside surface of our bodies that
we call our skin. Thus, the epithelial surfaces of our skin
and digestive tract face outward, serving as barriers to
the outside world. In the GI tract the outside world is
made up of things we ingest, chemicals that our bodies
secrete to act on them or secretions that simply need to
be removed from the tissues, all of which support and,
to some extent, govern the growth of a large microbial
mass. Hundreds of species of bacteria, protozoa and
fungi occupy every region of the GI tract in numbers
that range from a few hundred to a several million per
gram of content. This subject is considered in more
detail later in this chapter. Various types of breach in the
gastrointestinal barrier frequently become underlying
factors in chronic illness.
The proper function of the GI tract depends to a
large degree on a myriad of autonomic processes that
regulate peristalsis and coordinate it with the opening and closing of the appropriate sphincter valves.
These actions control the unidirectional movement of

## The Stomach

also required for proper release of vitamin B12 from food
sources. When stimulated, the parietal cells of the stomach secrete an isotonic solution containing enough HCl
to make the gastric fluid pH less than 1 (see Figure 7.1).
At this extreme acidity, the hydrogen ion concentration
of gastric fluid is about 3 million times greater than that
of arterial blood. It takes a tremendous amount of cellular energy to maintain this gradient because of the high
activity of membrane pumps utilizing ATP. Perhaps it is
not surprising that problems of intestinal absorption are
often due to inadequate secretion of HCl.17 Depletion of
B-complex vitamins may be the precipitating event leading to reduced energy production in cells of the gastric
pits. Patients over 50 years of age, who are particularly
prone to inadequate secretion of HCl (hypochlorhydria)
and intrinsic factor because of degenerative gastric disorders (e.g., atrophic gastritis), are frequently deficient in
vitamin B12.18
Symptoms of inadequate stomach acid are similar
to those of excess acid and are frequently mistaken.

Standard medical treatments focusing on the
gastrointestinal tract most often involve treating stomach issues. Proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 (H2)
receptor antagonists and other types of antacid drugs are
among the most frequently prescribed medications. The
use of these medications can generate other risk factors
originating from altered GI function, including bacterial
overgrowth,13, 14 interstitial nephritis15 and hip fracture.16 By frequency of medical treatment and by scope
of effects, the stomach becomes primary for evaluating
gastrointestinal function. The primary function of the
stomach is receiving and retaining food for the secretion
of gastric acid to initiate the digestive process.
Gastric secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is
essential for proper assimilation of elements such as
calcium and zinc, digestion of protein (proteolytic
activity of pepsin requires a pH of less than 5) and for
adequate sterilization of stomach contents. Low pH is

Protein digestion is interrupted and elemental absorption is impaired when food is not adequately acidified. Blocking of
stomach acid secretion by pharmaceutical agents designed to prevent heartburn and to treat stomach ulcers can easily
cause such interruption of digestion. Laboratory profiles of amino acids and essential elements frequently show low levels of
essential amino acids and essential trace elements, respectively, that are warning signs of the long term effects of insufficiency
of these critical nutrient factors. See Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements” and Chapter 4, “Amino Acids” for discussion
and illustration of those abnormalities.

GI Function

## Determination of Stomach Acid

The Heidelberg capsule test is considered to accurately assess stomach acid, though it is time consuming
for the patient, taking up to 90 minutes to complete.25
It will be described here because this type of test can
give definitive answers about the adequacy of gastric
acid secretion. The test uses a tiny plastic encapsulated
pH probe that is swallowed by the patient. The capsule,
small enough to safely pass the circuitous course of the
GI tract, contains a miniature radio transmitter that
continuously measures gastrointestinal pH and transmits
the data to a waistband antenna connected to a bedside
receiver. The pH readings are recorded for a permanent
record. The capsule can either be tied to a thin string for
retrieval or swallowed untethered. The latter approach
allows additional measurements of upper intestinal pH
to be gathered. After swallowing the capsule, pH readings typically start around 7.0, and then drop toward 1.0
as the capsule settles toward the stomach bottom. The
patient then drinks a challenge solution consisting of
concentrated sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which
has strong buffering capacity. Within half a minute,
the pH will normally rise to approximately 7. If acid
secretion is normal, the pH will fall again, returning to
between 1.0 and 2.0 within 20 minutes. The challenge
solution is given again and repeated up to four times,
as long as the pH response time is less than 20 minutes.
Hypochlorhydria is indicated for a patient requiring
more than 20 minutes to re-acidify. With achlorhydria,
the patient’s stomach secretes little acid, and the pH will
not fall below 4.0, even on the first challenge.25 Experienced technologists must administer this test because of
factors, such as the timing of bicarbonate solutions that
are critical for accurate, reproducible results.
Direct sampling of stomach contents by retrieving
an absorptive string swallowed by the patient can provide evidence of stomach pH and bacterial levels. The
protocol is less invasive than intubation, but it depends
on the tube reaching the surface of the stomach when
swallowed. Some evidence indicates quite good results

Upper abdominal burning sensations associated with
mealtime are reported in both cases. Excessive acidification of stomach contents leads to burning sensation
from exposure of the lower esophagus to highly acidic
chyme. With inadequate stomach acid production,
regurgitation of chyme into the lower esophagus causes
such burning pain. In these cases, advising antacids is
contraindicated and counterproductive because they
neutralize the acid that is produced, further interfering with digestion. Long-term effects of inadequate
stomach acid are much more difficult to study. However, it is now established that absorption of calcium
is decreased19 and subsequent risk of hip fracture is
significantly increased in patients who have used proton pump inhibitor medications for one year or more.16
These results indicate that absorption of other elements
is similarly affected. See Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic
Elements,” for discussion of element dependence on
stomach acid.
Stomach acid secretion is a principal line of defense
against infection of the GI tract.20 The proteolytic enzyme activity and low pH in normal gastric secretions
kill most of the bacteria and parasites that contaminate
food. Chronic hypochlorhydria, whether induced by
habitual use of antacids or due to gastric disorders,
increases the risk of infection and intestinal microbial
overgrowth.21 The risk of infection is multiplied when
hypochlorhydria simultaneously reduces zinc and
other trace elements critical for immune system function. Patients with malabsorptive disease, in particular,
are at risk of various mineral deficiencies. Inhibition of
gastric acid secretion reduces absorption of most trace
elements22 because gastric acid serves to release minerals from their complexed native forms in the stomach.23
Variations in stomach acid production can explain
why the absorption efficiency for dietary calcium varies widely from individual to individual, ranging from
15 to 45%, even with adequate calcium intake. Thus,
some individuals seem inherently to be better absorbers
of calcium.24
Notes:

Prior to 1997, numerous reports had appeared
regarding assessment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency by the PABA test, in which serum or urinary
p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is measured following oral
administration of the dipeptide N-benzoyltyrosyl-paminobenzoic acid (BT-PABA) to a fasting patient.33 A
dose of 16.7 mg of BT-PABA/kg body weight is administered. Results were usually expressed as a PABA
index, and reference limits varying between 55 and 75%
of the administered dose appearing in urine over the
next 24 hours were used, according to the laboratory
performing the test. Results below the reference limit are
evidence of impaired pancreatic protease secretion.
Chyme in the upper portions of the small intestine
is also a stimulus for the release of bile, necessary for
proper digestion of fat. Bile is synthesized in the liver
and stored in the gallbladder until release. Bile, which
contains no digestive enzyme activity, is important for
digestion due to its high content of bile salts. Bile salts
emulsify fat into smaller-sized globules that can be digested by pancreatic lipase.

for assessment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD)26 and for specimen collection to culture
Helicobacter pylori.27-29 Even duodenal sampling with the
string test has been reported to be helpful for evaluating
cholestatic jaundice in infancy.30, 31 The string test was
found to be unacceptable for detection of small bowel
bacterial overgrowth.32
Other laboratory abnormalities are frequently related to or caused by inadequate stomach acid production.
Multiple trace element deficiencies are sometimes found
in individuals who have apparent adequate dietary intake. Because of the acid dependency of trace elements,
evidence of multiple trace element deficiencies has been
used as an indirect measure of adequacy of gastric acid
flow. For example, simultaneous low levels of iron, zinc,
copper and manganese in serum, erythrocytes or hair is
often due to gastric acid inadequacy, especially when intake of trace elements is normal. The critical function of
low pH in the stomach is required to set up mineral absorption (see Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements”).
High levels of ammonia produced by bacterial action on
amino acids are even more directly associated with inadequate hydrochloric acid. The loss of bactericidal action
and the failure to digest protein due to low stomach
acid simultaneously lead to higher bacterial populations
and greater availability of unassimilated amino acids for
bacterial conversion.

The Pancreas
and Gallbladder

Pancreaticobiliary fluid composition can be highly
variable. The pancreas contributes to digestion by secreting alkaline bicarbonate and a variety of digestive enzymes. Secretion of pancreatic fluid is controlled in part
by vagus nerve stimulation. A more important regulatory
mechanism of pancreatic secretion is the control exerted
by the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK).
Both are synthesized in the duodenum (upper small
intestine) and secreted in response to the presence of
acidified chyme in the small intestine. Additionally, CCK
stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder, causing
the release of bile into the duodenum. Secretin stimulates the flow of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid that
serves to raise the pH of normal chyme from below 4 to
above 7, allowing trypsin and other pancreatic digestive
enzymes to reach their maximal activities (Figure 7.2).
The fecal chymotrypsin test is a useful non-invasive test to determine chronic pancreatic insufficiency.34
False-positive results of up to 10% have been reported
in normal individuals. Greater reliability for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis can be obtained by performing
the fecal chymotrypsin test in combination with the
bentiromide (N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid)
test.35 The bentiromide test measures the amount of paminobenzoic acid (PABA) appearing in urine following
an oral bentiromide loading, indicating successful chymotrypsin cleavage at the tyrosyl peptide bond. PABA
excretion rates are lower in patients with compromised
pancreatic function than in healthy control subjects.36

## Fecal Pancreatic Elastase
A newer alternative or companion test to the fecal
chymotrypsin assay is fecal pancreatic elastase. Human
pancreatic elastase, a member of the acidic elastase family, was first detected by Sziegoleit as a new endoprotease and sterol-binding protein present in both human
pancreatic secretions and feces.37-43 Elastase, unlike
chymotrypsin, has been found to remain unaffected
during intestinal transit and to be stable in stool samples
for up to a week at room temperature.37, 41, 42 Elastase
cannot be detected in bovine or porcine pancreatic

creatitis (often caused by biliary microlithiasis) may also
be much more common than was previously believed.
Approximately 20 to 40% of chronic pancreatitis patients will develop secondary diabetes, whereas diabetes
can impair pancreatic exocrine function at least as often.45 Pancreatic elastase has been advocated as a screening test for pancreatic insufficiency, chronic pancreatitis,
biliary microlithiasis and elevated risk of the development of diabetes. Undiagnosed and untreated pancreatic
insufficiency can also result in malabsorption of proteins,
fats and, ultimately, the entire spectrum of fat-soluble vitamins.46-50 Reduced pancreatic elastase, combined with
elevations in fecal protein, meat and vegetable fibers, are
clinical indications for supplemental pancreatic enzyme
and betaine hydrochloride supplementation.

enzyme preparations. Therefore, unlike chymotrypsin,
it is not affected by oral pancreatic enzyme replacement
therapy (see Figure 7.3).37 Elastase is also not affected by
previous gastrointestinal surgery, gastric dysmotility or
mucosal disease of the small intestine. Fecal elastase is a
simple, non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and accurate
functional test for patients with suspected pancreatic
exocrine insufficiency and/or chronic pancreatitis, and
is superior to the fecal chymotrypsin determination and
the more complicated pancreolauryl test for pancreatic
cholesterol hydrolase enzyme activity.37, 38, 44
Pancreatic exocrine dysfunction has been described
frequently in both insulin- and non-insulin-dependent
diabetes patients and is often considered a complication
of diabetes. However, diabetes secondary to chronic pan-

small (~ 4 cc) boluses of chyme that require pH neutralization by alkaline pancreatic fluid and fat emulsion by biliary flow.
The joining of biliary fluid with pancreatic fluid just before entry into the mid-duodenum helps to protect the pancreas
from un-neutralized stomach acid and it assures the co-mixing of both fluid types with the chyme. The frequency of allergic
reactions to foods such as nuts and milk derives, in part, from the strong requirement of those foods with high fat content and
content of proteins that are difficult to digest. The undigested food proteins pass into the small intestine where they can gain
entry to the intestinal blood supply, requiring processing by the immune system (see below under “The Immune Barrier”).

test does not distinguish between fat maldigestion from
fat malabsorption. Instead, tests for fecal triglycerides
and long-chain free fatty acids can help differentiate
between the two disorders. Since most of the dietary fat
is composed of triglycerides, excess fecal triglyceride
levels indicate incomplete fat hydrolysis (maldigestion).
This is possibly due to inadequate pancreatic secretion
or activation of pancreatic lipase, which can cause excessive, unhydrolyzed triglycerides to be excreted in the
feces.52 Animal studies using a radio-labeled triglyceride
found that significantly greater amounts of radioactivity
were present in the triglyceride fraction of the feces from
those animals with pancreatic insufficiency compared
with controls.53 On the other hand, if fecal triglycerides
are normal but the feces contains excess long-chain
free fatty acids (carbon length > 12C), malabsorption
is indicated. This is because long-chain free fatty acids
are readily absorbed in the presence of a fully functioning intestinal mucosa. Animal research has shown high
levels of free fatty acid fractions in the feces of animals
with short-bowel syndrome.53

## Fecal Steroids

Fecal Fat

Twelve patients with cystic fibrosis and steatorrhea were
treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.
Their fecal fat, chymotrypsin and immunoreactive
elastase were measured before and during therapy.
The absence of immunoreactive elastase in bovine and
porcine pancreatic enzyme preparations is shown as lack
of change while chymotrypsin shows a marked rise. Fecal
elastase, therefore, reflects only endogenous pancreatic
output.382

Figure 7.3 — Enzyme Replacement Therapy

Fat absorption is a passive process. Bile and pancreatic lipases greatly facilitate the rate of fat absorption.
Brush-border lipase activity and simple diffusion allow
for the absorption of a considerable proportion of fat in
the healthy intestine, even in the absence of bile. Oils
containing unsaturated fatty acids are absorbed more
quickly than saturated fats. Within the intestinal cell,
fatty acids are packaged and released into lymphatic
circulation as chylomicron particles. Since the lymphatic vessels drain into the arterial system, dietary fat
is presented directly to extrahepatic tissues. However,
medium-chain fatty acids (6 to 12 carbons) are water
soluble and require minimal lipase activity and less bile
salt for solubilization. Therefore, they enter portal circulation rather than the lymphatic drainage of the small
intestine.
Steatorrhea, defined as the presence of excess fat in
the stool, is established by fat-balance studies.51 Normal
fecal excretion of fat is less than 6 g/d. However, this
Fecal steroids come from dietary cholesterol, intestinal mucosal sloughing, and bile acids and cholesterol
contained in bile. Fecal cholesterol content can range
from 75 to 200 mg/d, most of which comes from bile.
The wide variation in fecal steroid content is due to
many factors. Especially interesting is the effect of a high
dietary polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio,
resulting in increased fecal steroids.54, 55 These data demonstrate that increasing intake of dietary fat containing
polyunsaturated fatty acids is effective for lowering total
serum cholesterol without reducing HDL cholesterol.
The mechanism involves reduced absorption of cholesterol. Additional reduction in sterol absorption may
be obtained by increasing foods high in dietary fiber.
Several reports have demonstrated the ability of various
dietary fibers, phytosterols and phytostanols to modulate fecal steroid content.56-59

## Fecal Fibers
Microscopic inspection of stool can reveal the
presence of meat and vegetable fibers. The increase in
the amount of these fibers that occurs with impaired
digestion is an indirect indicator of hypochlorhydria or
insufficient output of pancreatic enzymes.60, 61

GI Function

The Small Intestine:

small peptides, primarily free amino acids pass into
the portal vein and go to the liver.65, 66 This process
is one of the principal dynamic actions affecting the
concentrations of amino acids in blood plasma (see
Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”). Direct utilization by intestinal cells contributes to the overall dynamic action of

but is protein from sloughed off epithelial cells and
digestive enzymes.

amino acids obtained from dietary protein. Up to 50% of
orally consumed amino acids may be used by intestinal
cells, never becoming available for transport into portal
circulation.

Schilling Test

The Schilling test was primarily used to assess
the absorptive capacity of the GI tract for vitamin B12.
However, the use of the Schilling test for the detection
of pernicious anemia has been largely supplanted by
serologic testing for parietal cell antibodies or direct assay for intrinsic factor antibodies, the absence of which
creates a positive Schilling test.67
Notes:

The intestinal brush border contains various membrane-associated enzymes (e.g., sucrase, lactase, dextrinase, maltase, isomaltase, trehalase) that cleave numerous
polysaccharides and disaccharides (sucrose and lactose)
to absorbable monosaccharides (glucose and fructose),
the products of luminal digestion of dietary starches and
fiber. Simple sugars (glucose, fructose and galactose)
are principally absorbed by saturable active-transport
processes. Impairment of brush-border enzyme activity causes carbohydrate malabsorption, which leads to
excess bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed disaccharides and an increase in osmolarity that is accompanied
by diarrhea and flatulence.61 Although most people
consume too little dietary fiber, excessive dietary fiber
(> 50 g/d), which is resistant to the action of human
digestive enzymes, but is broken down by gut bacteria,
can lead to diarrhea and gas as well.
The amount of mannitol appearing in urine after
a standard oral load of this monosaccharide derivative is used as a measure of small intestinal capacity for
monosaccharide (glucose and fructose) absorption (see
section below, “Lactulose-Mannitol Intestinal Permeability Challenge Test”). The disaccharidase functions cannot be measured by routine laboratory evaluations, but
clinical observations have indicated that the disaccharide
enzymes play a role in inflammatory bowel conditions
such as celiac disease. Elimination of all disaccharide
sources has been helpful in many of these cases.62
The diet is difficult to maintain because all sources of
sucrose, maltose and isomaltose must be eliminated.
Maltose and isomaltose are produced in the earlier
phases of digestion of starch, so all starch sources must
be restricted. Enteral insulin-like growth factor 1 has
shown promise for inducing the formation of intestinal
disaccharidase enzymes.63
Brush-border and cytosolic peptidases hydrolyze
small peptides to produce amino acids. Although most
proteins are digested to free amino acids prior to absorption, the absorption of large peptides plays a significant
role in the assimilation of dietary protein.64 The transport mechanism for the uptake of peptides by mucosal
cells differs from the mechanism for free amino acid
uptake, and there is no competition between the two.
Nonetheless, because peptide hydrolase enzymes in the
brush border and cytosol of mucosal cells hydrolyze

The closely packed villi of the small intestine are the primary absorptive unit of the digestive system. The villous surface is
the interface between systemic fluids and the complex matrix flowing through the lumen where small and large molecules
from food components mix with digestive fluids, intestinal secretions and the dynamically changing microbial mass. The tall
columnar epithelial cells represented in the lower left are constantly being replaced by cell divisions at the base of the villi.
Immune cells are interspersed individually and in groups such as Peyer’s patches (not shown). A dendritic cell is shown with a
projection into the lumen where bacterial antigens are sampled for presentation to lymphocytes and macrophages.

Figure 7.5 — Jejunal Section Photomicrograph
Villi are outlined by tall columnar epithelial cell nuclei
which are darkly stained in this image. The mucosal surface
evaginates into villi (green outlines) and invaginates into
crypts. Though some crypts appear “disconnected” due
to the way the tissue was sectioned, the epithelium of villi
is continuous with that of adjacent crypts as noted by the
yellow arrowheads. The inner villous surface is lined by cells
of the lamina propria, and the long, apparent empty spaces
are lacteals that empty into the lymphatic system. The
muscularis mucosae is only a few muscle fibers in thickness,
lying beneath the crypts. Intraepithelial lymphocytes
are positioned between epithelial cells, beneath the tight
junctions, so they are inside the epithelium, but not inside
epithelial cells as the name may incorrectly suggest.

The lining of the intestinal tract must endure considerable physical, chemical and biological challenges.
In response to the entry of harsh gastric juices, the
duodenum releases large quantities of mucus that serves
to coat and protect the intestinal mucosa from digestion by gastric juice and pancreatic digestive enzymes.
The mucus barrier is constantly being eroded, posing
challenges to the underlying cells. Turnover of intestinal epithelial cells is among the highest in the body, as
new cells must constantly replace those lost to luminal
degradation. New cells form at the base of the crypts
in the layer of tall columnar epithelial cells that are
the outer cellular barrier. The newly formed cells must
establish tight junctions to seal off the barrier from passage of large amounts of macromolecular components.
The susceptibility of the cellular junctions to penetration
by large molecules normally results in about 2% of food
proteins getting past the mucosa in a form the immune
system can recognize.68
Testing for serum IgG concentrations also provides
evidence of the integrity of the physical barrier because
elevated IgG levels are found only when food antigens
can penetrate the physical barrier at an abnormally high
rate. The finding of significant IgG elevations toward
food antibodies is evidence of increased intestinal
permeability and a failure to maintain adequate barrier
function because it addresses the central question: Are
large, undigested molecules (usually proteins) able to
pass into the submucosal layers?

Intestinal Hyperpermeability
(Leaky Gut Syndrome)

Leaky gut syndrome is a disorder associated with
increased intestinal permeability, subsequent to the loss
of intestinal mucosa integrity. Patients with this condition
have more than the normal 2% “leakiness” to large molecules. Degradation of the physical barrier often is due to
exposure to toxic substances within the intestinal lumen
that can damage the “tight junctions” between intestinal
epithelial cells, leading to an increase in passive paracellular absorption.69, 70 Common causes of intestinal hyperpermeability are ethanol consumption,71 non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and viral, bacterial,
yeast and protozoan infection.72-75 Also, elevated levels of
reactive oxygen species coming from a variety of sources,
such as bile, food, cytotoxic drugs76 or inflammatory
cells,77, 78 can increase paracellular permeability.

Macromolecules that penetrate the intestinal barrier
are carried in the portal vein to the liver, where they
are degraded by phagocytic Kupffer cells. Xenobiotics
and microbial toxins must be processed by the liver’s
Phase I and Phase II detoxification systems for excretion
into bile or urine (see Chapter 8, “Toxins and Detoxification”). In the colon, where bacterial toxin production is high, the colonocytes carry out the detoxification reactions utilizing the same reactions that occur
in the liver.79 Even for the intact GI tract, the cost of
detoxification is high; antioxidants and conjugates such
as glutathione are consumed and must be replenished.
Compromise of the intestinal barrier can lead to excess
production of reactive oxygen species by the hepatic

these sugars are not metabolized, any absorbed sugar
is fully excreted in the urine within 6 hours. The urine
is collected, and concentrations of the two sugars are
measured. Percent absorptions are calculated using the
formula below.
% Compound Absorption = Compound
Concentration (mg/mL) × Urine volume (mL) × 100

Mannitol, a monosaccharide, is passively absorbed
through the intestinal mucosa. In contrast, lactulose, a
disaccharide, is normally not absorbed unless the mucosal barrier is compromised. In the healthy intestine,
the mean absorption of mannitol is 14% of the administered dose, whereas the mean absorption of lactulose
is less than 1%. The normal ratio of lactulose-mannitol
recovered in urine is < 0.03. An elevated ratio means
that excessive lactulose was absorbed, indicating leaky
gut syndrome. It is best to have the patient perform the
lactulose-mannitol test twice—first in the fasting state,
then again after ingestion of a test meal.90 The lactulosemannitol ratio was found to be an accurate predictor of
relapse when measured in patients with Crohn’s disease
who were clinically in remission.91 Recent intake of high
carbohydrate meals and prolonged administration of the
challenge solutions diminish responses to this test.

mixed-function oxidase (cytochrome P450) system.
Increased hepatic detoxification causes increased biliary excretion of reactive and carcinogenic compounds.
Reflux of this “toxic” bile may be an important cause of
chronic pancreatic disease.80, 81 Intestinal hyperpermeability also causes disorders by immunologic mechanisms. Increased permeability can stimulate hypersensitivity responses to food and components of the gut flora.
Dietary gluten and bacterial endotoxin may cause nonspecific activation of the immune system’s inflammatory
pathways, mediated by complement and cytokines. It
has been shown experimentally that chronic low-grade
endotoxemia leads to autoimmune disorders.82-84
Intestinal hyperpermeability is found in all chronic
inflammatory bowel diseases, where it may play an etiologic role, or it may be a secondary consequence due to
the vicious cycle involving immune activation, hepatic
dysfunction and pancreatic insufficiency.85 The role of
leaky gut syndrome in many diseases is often missed.
The availability of non-invasive and affordable methods
for measuring intestinal hyperpermeability makes it
possible for clinicians to watch for leaky gut syndrome
in their patients and to objectively assess the efficacy of
treatment.

The lactulose-mannitol protocol was developed to
measure intestinal hyperpermeability that could lead to
food sensitivity.86 It is being utilized in assessment of gut
permeability in a wide range of conditions, including
food sensitivities,87 pancreatitis,88 Crohn’s disease89 and
cirrhosis. Although the presence of elevated IgG levels
to many foods in the test described above indicates hyperpermeability to macromolecular antigenic molecules,
the lactulose-mannitol test provides a direct measure
of hyperpermeability to the disaccharide lactulose.
Lactulose-mannitol is a challenge test in which patients
with suspected hyperpermeability ingest 5 g each of the
metabolically inert sugars lactulose and mannitol. Since

undergoing rapid degeneration.97 The antecedent factor
of gluten-activated immune response is revealed by
elevated antigliadin IgA II. This test may be positive in
patients with limited villous atrophy during early stages
of the condition.98, 99 Those with celiac disease should
consume a gluten-free diet, eliminating products containing wheat, rye and barley.

Neutrophil-Derived Inflammatory Proteins —
Bovine lactoferrin (Lf) is a milk protein that exhibits
broad-spectrum antimicrobial action, largely due to its
affinity for iron that deprives bacteria of iron critical for
their growth.100 This type of antibacterial mechanism is
sometimes called nutritional immunity.101 Human lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein secreted by mucosal
membranes, is a major granular component of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. When these cells respond to
inflammatory signals, lactoferrin is released as part of
the defense mechanism. Fecal Lf is a marker of intestinal
inflammation in which leukocytes infiltrate the mucosa,
increasing the release of neutrophil lactoferrin. Fecal Lf
has been extensively used to differentiate inflammatory
bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
non-inflammatory bacterial infections, and it is useful
for monitoring IBD treatment efficacy.89, 102-109
Various other neutrophil-derived proteins,
such as calprotectin (Cal), polymorphonuclear neutrophil-elastase (PMN-e), α1-antitrypsin and lysozyme
(Lys) have been shown to be reliable indicators of
intestinal inflammation and can aid in the differentiation of organic intestinal disorders (i.e., inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s
disease, infectious gastroenteritis, etc.) from functional
intestinal disorders (i.e., IBS).103-106, 110-117 Fecal levels
of these proteins rapidly increase with the influx of
leukocytes into the intestinal lumen during inflammation. Among the neutrophil-derived proteins in
feces, PMN-e, Cal and Lf represent the most accurate
markers of disease activity and severity in patients
with ulcerative colitis, with lysozyme being somewhat
less useful.112, 113 Fecal Cal is increased in over 95% of
patients with IBD and correlates well with clinical disease activity. PMN-e and Cal also reliably differentiate
between patients with IBD and IBS.115, 116 Thus, there
are several markers that provide reliable differentiation
of Crohn’s disease from IBS.

of host-microbe interactions are starting to be revealed.
Resident flora interact with antigen-presenting cells in
the lamina propria or cross the epithelial barrier without
causing inflammation. The antigen-presenting dendritic
cells in the lamina propria extend processes between
epithelial cells and into the gut lumen as illustrated
in Figure 7.4. By this periscope-like activity, they take
up bacteria or antigens associated with bacteria in the
microbial flora.92, 93 Commensal organisms introduced
into the gut lumen of a germ-free mouse can gain entry
into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT),94 and
some survive in dendritic cells for a limited time, where
they are processed for stimulation of B lymphocytes. The
B cells, in turn, produce IgA that can inhibit binding of
microorganisms to epithelial cells. The IgA responses
also promote bacterial uptake across specialized M cells
that overlie Peyer’s patches, where various immune
cellular activities are at a high pitch. In addition, when
introduced into the lumen of mice, probiotic organisms activate regulatory T lymphocytes that have the
ability to inhibit subsequent induction of inflammatory
responses.95 These microorganisms must gain access
to mucosal dendritic cells to make the induction and
expansion of the regulatory immune cells possible. It
is when these mechanisms of bacterial recognition and
limitation of penetration fail that the powerful immune
responses of the GALT can produce pathological inflammation such as that found in celiac disease.

Enteropathies Induced by Gliadin — Inherited
factors make some individuals sensitive to a protein
called gliadin, present in some cereal grains. Gliadin is a
part of the total protein, or gluten, in the grains. When
undigested gluten reaches the small intestine, gliadin
peptides activate autoimmune reactions in susceptible
individuals. As many as 1 in 133 Americans with no
previous symptoms or family history of celiac disease
may be affected.96
Serum IgA should be measured to confirm IgA
competence and to assure the validity of the tissue- and
antigen-specific tests for gluten-sensitive enteropathies.
For total IgA > 10, the other markers are reliable indicators. For total IgA < 10, testing of IgG antibodies to
transglutaminase and gliadin may be used. Elevated or
moderately depressed IgA can indicate gut-associated
lymphoid tissue hyper- or hypofunction, respectively.
Elevated tissue transglutaminase indicates the presence of celiac disease with high sensitivity and specificity

Fecal Histamine — The detection of fecal histamine
is gaining utility as a diagnostic marker. Histaminosis
provides direct evidence of intestinal mucosal inflammation and can be used in addition to other less direct
markers of inflammation such as fecal Lf, Cal, PMN-e
and lysozyme.118 Amon and colleagues have stated,
“There is increasing evidence that enteral histaminosis is a major cause of food intolerance resulting from
dysfunctional metabolism of endogenous histamine in
certain food stuffs. However, this phenomenon has been
poorly characterized, and, due to lack of epidemiologic
data, the existence of this condition has probably been
underestimated, resulting in improper diagnosis.”119
Fecal histamine levels can have contributions from foods
that contain significant amounts of histamine, including
various cheeses, sausage, vinegar, some species of fish,

red wine, beer and vegetables, including spinach, tomatoes and sauerkraut. Food additives, including taste enhancers such as glutamate; preservatives such as sorbic
acid, benzoate, BHT and BHA; and many colorants also
act as liberators of histamine. There is also evidence that
eosinophils and mast cells accumulate and become activated in inflammatory bowel disorders and also contribute to the presence of histaminosis in a wide spectrum of
inflammatory bowel disorders.120, 121 Bacterial origins of
histaminosis also play a significant role, including histamine-producing bacteria (HPB) found in various fishes.
Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca are the best-known
HPB in fish. However, 22 strains of HPB from fish first
identified as K. pneumoniae or K. oxytoca by commercialized systems were later correctly identified as Raoultella
planticola (formerly K. planticola) by additional tests.

The three insets show a progression from health to Crohn’s disease. Paneth cells have functions similar to neutrophils.
From their position at the base of crypts, they provide host defense against microbes in the small intestine. One important
mechanism is the production and secretion of the microbiocidal, a-defensin. Defective Paneth cells have low a-defensin
output, allowing opportunistic bacterial overgrowth. Bacterial antigens are detected by dendritic cells that stimulate T-cell
cytokine release. The inflammatory cascade leads to further intestinal degradation in a feed-forward cycle. Improvements
may come from reducing small intestinal bacterial populations, reducing the load of major antigen-producing foods and
improving omega-3 fatty acid body composition to help reduce inflammatory signaling.

function, increased intestinal microbe levels and chronic
inflammation, which may all be crucial in the pathophysiology of CD, ulcerative colitis and possibly other
inflammatory bowel disorders.128, 137, 138 Defensins also
appear to play an important role in the suppression of
potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Klebsiella and
Yersinia species, which play a role in molecular mimicry
responses and the pathogenesis of a host of autoimmune
disorders, including inflammatory arthritis and immunogenic thyroiditis.139, 140 (For more information on this
topic, see sections on intestinal dysbiosis and disease,
and bacterial and yeast assessment under “The Microbial
Mass” later in this chapter.)

Mucosal Defensins — Defensins are endogenous
mucosal antibiotic peptides with microbicidal activity
against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi,
viruses and protozoa.125 Routine laboratory measurements of fecal defensins have recently become available.126 Defensins play pivotal roles in innate immunity
and the maintenance of the delicate balance between
immune tolerance and immune response by regulating
rates of microbial colonization and slowing pathogen
growth.127, 128
Crohn’s disease (CD), an idiopathic inflammatory
bowel disease, has been linked to reductions in intestinal
antibacterial activity in mucosal secretions and increased
intestinal bacteria, which may result in chronic inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals.129 Paneth
cells (PCs) are the main source of antimicrobial peptides
in the small intestine, including the α-defensins HD5
and HD6 (see Figure 7.6). Deficiency of PC defensins
may perpetuate ileal CD by compromising the innate
immune defense.130-132 Ileal CD has also been linked to
a mutation in the NOD2 gene.133 The Paneth cells that
produce the α-defensins express NOD2, and mutations
of this gene have been found to result in diminished
expression of ileal PC defensins.129, 132, 134-136 Crohn’s
disease of the colon (versus the small intestine), on the
other hand, is characterized not by reduction in PC
α-defensins, but a decrease in β-defensins in enterocytes. β-Defensin production is generally stimulated by
cytokines and bacterial endotoxins in epithelial tissue
and mononuclear phagocytes and may be deficient in
subjects with CD. Therefore, the regional subtypes of
CD can be associated with different defensin profiles. In
both variants, it appears that decreased mucosal defensin levels result in weakened intestinal barrier immune

The Immune Barrier

Similarly, 5 strains of R. ornithinolytica (formerly K. ornithinolytica) were isolated from fish as new HPB.122 These
strains, often simply identified as Klebsiella spp., may be
detected on stool analysis, and this variant of dysbiosis should be considered as a potential reason for the
presence of histaminosis and gastrointestinal inflammation.122, 123 New trends in the pharmacologic treatment of
bloody diarrhea, usually related to hemorrhagic gastritis,
and diarrhea-predominant IBS often now feature the use
of histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist medications, further demonstrating the importance and clinical efficacy
of reducing the effects of histamine in the management
of inflammatory gastrointestinal disease.124

The immune barrier aspect of gastrointestinal
health is important in evaluating adverse immune reactions to food and predicting overall intestinal health.
Assessments of food reactions offer practical information
regarding food choices that enhance health restoration in
the patient with compromised GI function.
It can be difficult to grasp the magnitude of the
challenge presented to the immune system in the gut.
The enzymes of human tissues are designed to handle
a flow of substances presented one molecule at a time.
Each day, the act of eating introduces an astronomical
number of molecules in the form of polymers unsuitable for cell processing, along with toxins and microbes.
Whenever the digestive process fails to work in a timely
and efficient manner, undigested or partially digested
food molecules that exit the stomach become part of an
antigen-rich slurry. The mixture passes into a microbial
growth chamber—the lumen of the small and large
intestines—where constant, warm temperature, neutral
pH, and steady flow encourage rapid bacterial growth
and reproduction. Bacterial cell turnover yields another
host of antigenic molecules from macromolecules that
they produce. Cells of the immune system must constantly survey every region of the gut for entry of foreign
molecules or microbes, monitor signals for increasing

In this image of canine ileum, three lymphoid follicles of a

defensive barriers, and, when necessary, mount aggressive removal strategies while keeping destructive
forces in check so that normal tissues can continue the
never-ending process of nutrient assimilation, repair and
maintenance.
The field of immunology is still in a state of controversy over just how adverse reactions to foods should be
classified and how best to evaluate the immune function
of the GI system. The following is a brief overview of
certain details to allow the reader to see the intricacies
of this system. Excellent reviews of the cellular and molecular aspects of immunology are available.141 The principal laboratory tests currently available for evaluation of
the state of the gastrointestinal immune barrier function
are the measurements of serum levels of antibodies to
specific foods and salivary or fecal secretory antibodies.
Throughout the entire length of the small intestine
are patches of lymphoid tissue called Peyer’s patches (see
Figure 7.7), collectively called gut-associated lymphoid
tissue (GALT). Because these cells are in the mucosal layer, the term mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
is sometimes used as well. Of the total cell mass of the
immune system, the gut is by far the largest immune organ. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are interspersed
among the epithelial cells (enterocytes) lining the
intestine. The IELs collectively represent a pool of cells
comparable in size to that of all peripheral lymphocytes
in the spleen. There has been an explosion of data from
research laboratories about the intercellular communication that regulates the activities of this part of the immune system. Cytokines, nuclear factors, interferons and
integrins regulate CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes.142 The
constant challenge of food and microbial antigen presentation frequently leads to abnormal growth. Neoplastic
colorectal lesions, for example, contain cytotoxic IELs.143
One of the results of hyperstimulation of intestinal cellular immune responses is an increase in the permeability
of the cellular lining of the small intestine. Tall columnar epithelial cells that form the physical boundary are
constantly replaced in the normal small intestine. High
rates of cell division at the base of villi results in a constant migration toward the villous tip where old cells are
sloughed off into the lumen (Figure 7.5). The combination of high rates of cell replication over the large area of
the small intestine and extensive immunoglobulin biosynthesis in the GALT accounts for the consumption of a
large percentage of normal caloric intakes to sustain the
structure and function of the GI tract. In addition to the
energetic demands, large percentages of daily requirements for vitamins, elements, essential amino acids and
fatty acids are consumed by the cells of the GI tract.144
The barrier function depends on tight junctions
between the cells. Any breach in cell-to-cell junctions
presents an opening for antigen flow and further immune response. Antibody responses to food antigens can
result in clinical food allergy symptoms.11 Children with
regressive autism show strikingly increased deposition
of IgG immune complexes, along with increases in mucosal lymphocyte density and crypt cell proliferation.145
Similar deposits are found in gastric antral biopsies from
autistic children where they are associated with a novel
type of CD8 lymphocyte gastritis.145
Interactions between food macromolecules or the
fragments released from them by partial digestion and
the GALT produce symptoms in distant tissues, especially the skin.146 Food-GALT reactions can also cause lesions in brain white matter associated with inflammatory
bowel disease.147 There is growing evidence that food or
microbe-initiated inflammatory products from the GALT
can trigger reactions that are part of the initiation of
degenerative diseases, including arthritis, atherosclerosis
and dementia.148 Autoimmune thyroid disease is seen in

In addition to the intrachain disulfide bonds (-S-S-),
covalent linkages also form between heavy and light chains

chains in all except the IgG4 class. The immunoglobulin

(epitopes) of macromolecular antigens from food or
microbes that initiate humoral immune response.

much higher prevalence in subjects with celiac disease
(i.e., gluten intolerance) than in normal controls.149
Reduced production of such inflammatory signals may
be achieved by normalizing function throughout the
gastrointestinal tract.
There is a complex relationship between intestinal
hyperpermeability and adverse food reactions. Children
and adults with eczema, urticaria or asthma triggered
by atopic food allergy exhibit elevated intestinal permeability. These individuals can develop a self-perpetuating
cycle because increase in intestinal permeability can lead
to the development of food sensitivity, and it may be a
result of food allergy.86, 150, 151 The ultimate solution usually involves relieving the antigenic load by identifying
and removing offending foods and restoring the physical
barrier to reduce permeability.
In order to understand the differences between
abnormalities of antibody classes, it is helpful to
establish some definitions and their origins. Antibodies, discovered by the first Nobel prize winner, von
Behring, in 1901, came to be called immunoglobulins
(Ig), when they were found to migrate with the group
called γ-globulins during electrophoresis of serum
proteins.152 Produced in bone by B lymphocytes that differentiate into plasma cells, immunoglobulins constitute
humoral immunity, distinct from cellular immunity
(see Figure 7.8). Various physical, chemical and antigenic Ig differences led to classification of, first, the higher
concentration members, IgG, IgM and IgA, and then the
much lower concentration IgD and IgE classes. Characteristics of the classes are summarized in Table 7.2,
where the rows are sorted by normal serum concentration. Note that concentrations are directly and linearly
related to half-lives. In general, classes with greater
impact on immune system responses have shorter halflives to prevent adverse effects of overstimulation.

## Secretory IgA
The lymphoid tissue of the intestinal mucosa secretes immunoglobulin A into the lumen of the GI tract
as a first line of defense against microbes and antigens.
Produced by plasma cells at the basement membrane of
the GI tract, two molecules of IgA are connected by protein chains connecting the heavy chains, forming dimeric
sIgA that is transported to the luminal surface of the gut.
The term sIgA denotes this difference from monomeric
IgA measured in serum. Secretory IgA (sIgA) forms immune complexes with pathogens and allergens, which

prevents them from binding to and penetrating the
intestinal mucosa.153 A high antigenic load can result in
depressed sIgA, even in healthy, asymptomatic individuals.
With time, this decrease in resistance can lead to dys­
biosis and an increased risk of infection and allergy.154, 155

that levels of sIgA become depressed following such
levels of stress, whereas cortisol levels increase.166–170
Changes in levels of sIgA and cortisol in subjects under
pre- and post-examination stress have been somewhat contradictory.171, 172 The high-stress occupation
of air traffic controllers did not produce low sIgA, but
rather a transient elevation in sIgA and cortisol. These
results have been attributed to the acute nature of the
stresses experienced by the controllers or the counteracting effects of positive emotional engagement among
controllers in the workplace.173 In other situations,
psychological stress may alter antibody response to
immunization.174 Reduced physical activity and excess
body fat in children have also been demonstrated to result in decreased levels of sIgA and increased incidence
of upper respiratory infection.175 Relaxing activities,
such as choir singing, have been demonstrated to increase positive effect and sIgA, while reducing negative
effect and sIgA suppression.176 Perhaps it is summarized
best by Alshuler when she states, “Cortisol suppresses
secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to impaired gut antigen
sampling. Furthermore, cortisol alters the consistency

Individuals with selective sIgA deficiency have high titers
of antibodies against various food antigens.156
The secretory IgA function may be evaluated by
measurement of salivary or fecal sIgA levels.157 Salivary
sIgA is a predictor of the release of sIgA at intestinal
surfaces.158 A compromised immune barrier can lead to
elevated serum IgA and increased intestinal permeability to toxic gluten lectins. A gluten-free diet decreased
intestinal permeability in 64% of sIgA nephropathy
patients.159 Fecal sIgA correlates with salivary sIgA, and
both may be predictors of partial mucosal sIgA deficiency as defined by serum IgA > 0.05 g/L.160 Detection of
specific fecal sIgAs directed toward Rotavirus and hepatitis A is useful in diagnosis of early stages of infections by
these agents.161, 162
Suppression of sIgA has been associated with the
stress response. The level of sIgA measured in saliva
is down-regulated during periods of chronic stress,
whereas acute stress induces mobilization and results in
a transient increase in sIgA.163-165 Many studies on the effects of extreme physical and/or emotional stress in test
populations, such as military personnel in basic training
and competitive endurance athletes, have demonstrated

## Food-Directed Antibody Testing
Food antibody tests measure levels of specific immunoglobulins in serum directed against food antigens.
Elevated levels of food-specific IgE can cause allergic
reactions to food involving the anaphylactic response,
whereas high food-specific IgG can lead to sensitivity
reactions due to food antigen-antibody complex deposition (Table 7.3 and 7.4). Such reactions can lead to a
wide variety of symptoms, which can be as diverse as
ill-defined malaise and fatigue to digestive disorders,
skin problems, aching joints or back pain. One type of
reaction can proceed to a different type as the immune
response alters to chronic challenge. For example, cow’s
milk allergy in infancy, even when properly treated, can
lead years later to respiratory atopy and persistent atopic
dermatitis and recurrent ear infections.188, 189 These
observations have led others to speculate that it is the
allergic condition (or sensitivity) rather than a specific

“allergy” to milk that increases otitis media risk.190 A
mechanism to explain such phenomena must include
initial IgE-mediated atopic reactions that give way to
later chronic Ig-Ag reactions of the type described below
in the section, “Food-Specific IgG Antibody Testing.”
In many people, undetected food reactions can be
a significant factor in overall health. The challenge is
to clearly define which foods may be causing adverse
reactions. The ultimate proof of an adverse food reaction is via an elimination-provocation process, where
the suspected food is removed from the diet and then
later reintroduced. If symptoms subside when the food
is avoided and return upon reintroduction of the food,
food intolerance is confirmed. This approach is time
consuming, but may be used for immediate reactions
where the symptoms may be assessed relatively easily.
For example, if watery eyes and headache occur whenever shrimps are eaten, then elimination of shrimps
from the diet may prevent the symptoms. If they occur
again when a trial of consuming a few shrimps is done,
then some antigen in shrimps is causing the problem.
In the case of delayed reaction, this process becomes
much more challenging since the pairing of food-related
reactions is less obvious.
The obviously tedious process of eliminationprovocation can be expedited with the use of in vitro
food-specific antibody tests. These tests measure
the amounts of antibodies that cause food reactions.
Although there are several ways foods can cause adverse
reactions, the antibody-mediated types are the most
common, and these tests provide the clinician and
patient useful data to design appropriate diets that avoid
the major offending foods.

of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. The combined
result of these effects is an enhanced immune response
to gut-derived antigens and increased translocation of
antigenic material to systemic circulation.”177 Stress plays
an important role in the compromise of the gastrointestinal mucosal immune response and the development of
pan-allergy to foods and potentially the development of
autoimmune phenomena via antigen-antibody complex
cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry. Combining
salivary sIgA with evaluation of cortisol and DHEA (see
Chapter 10, “Hormones”) may be beneficial in the overall assessment of the stress response and the management of leaky gut, food allergy, inflammatory arthritities, immunogenic thyroiditis, autoimmunity and other
chronic diseases.149, 178-187

## Food-Specific IgG Antibody Testing
Abnormal reactions to foods we eat are quite common. Some estimates are as high as 50% for the US
population.191 Clinical presentations range from chronic,
mild reactions to serious conditions, such as celiac disease, where gluten, a protein in cereal grains, causes inflammatory reactions leading to degradation of intestinal
villus stuctures. Celiac disease can easily be undetected
or misdiagnosed because of the highly variable type
and severity of symptoms. Abnormal food reactions can
cause many different types of symptoms. Common ones
include the following:
• GI: gas, bloating, pain, diarrhea, constipation

• Neurological: migraines, headaches,
brain fog, hyperactivity, depression

Examples would include lactose intolerance and
MSG sensitivity.
The IgE-mediated food allergy is the most commonly known reaction where contact with food causes
an immediate response. In some cases, this can cause
anaphylaxis. This reaction involves basophil or mast cell
degranulation and histamine release. Skin scratch testing can often reliably identify offending foods. In vitro
tests for the food-specific serum antibodies are also an
effective means of identifying reactive foods. This is the
method of choice if there is a severe reaction initiated by
the food. Since the IgE molecule can persist for years,
the most reliable treatment is long-term avoidance of the
offending food.
Although the IgE response is the most widely
recognized form of an adverse food reaction, the most
common type is the IgG-mediated form. This type is
less understood because of the intricacies of the human
immune system itself. The IgE system is designed to
detect and react to relatively tiny amounts of antigen.
Witness the common inhalant allergic response to small
amounts of unseen pollen in the air. Consumed food,
on the other hand, represents a huge amount of potential antigen presentation to the immune system. This
situation will elicit primarily an IgG response, not an
IgE response. Circulating levels of food-specific IgG can
combine with food antigens in the blood, which can
then form large food immune complexes that ordinarily are removed from the circulation by macrophages.
When macrophages become overloaded with complexes,
these accumulate in the blood and can deposit in various tissues, stimulating complement fixation, which
leads to a localized inflammatory response. This process
can take hours to days to produce a perceived reaction.
This delay between food consumption and symptom
makes it difficult for a person to recognize that the foods
being consumed are actually causing symptoms. This
is why this type of adverse food reaction is sometimes
referred to as “hidden food allergy.” In most cases, the
offending foods are those most commonly eaten. These
will present large amounts of antigen for the development of the IgG antibody production. Table 7.4 summarizes characteristics of IgE- and IgG-mediated immune
reactions to foods.
Interestingly, the ultimate cause of this situation
is not necessarily the characteristic of the food itself,
rather, the condition of the digestive tract that allows
the process to develop. One major theory as to how

• Somatic: unexplained fatigue,
myalgias, joint pain
• Immune: recurrent infections (ear, sinuses)

• Dermatological: rash, urticaria, allergic shiners

• Respiratory: chronic mucus, stuffy nose

With adverse food reactions so prevalent, the challenge is to clearly define which foods may be causing a
problem in each patient.

Types of Adverse Food Reactions — Although
there is some disagreement underlying mechanisms,
most experts agree that adverse reactions to food should
be classified as food allergy, food sensitivity, or food
intolerance.
(1) Food allergy: This term will be used to designate a response mediated by food-triggered basophil or
mast cell histamine release. This can be caused by either
IgG or IgE food-specific antibodies. These reactions are
immediate in nature and can be severe. This is the Type I
allergic reaction.
(2) Food sensitivity: This term relates to a purely
immune system-mediated response involving various
classes of food-specific immunoglobulin molecules that
can form food immune complexes. These complexes can
stimulate the complement cascade and localized inflammation. These reactions tend to be delayed—hours up
to 7 days after food consumption—in some cases. This
is a Type III allergic reaction.
(3) Food intolerance: This term refers to a nonimmunological mechanism of adverse food response.

GI Function

sensitivities, therefore, can come from the activation
of complement via IgG1/IgG4 food immune complex.
Deposition of these complexes can also occur in tissue
or organs, leading to damage. This sequence of events is
thought to be the most common way individuals develop
adverse reactions to foods they eat on a regular basis.
IgG1 antibodies tend to be more “sticky” and can
bind more non-selectively to antigens, leading to a
greater chance of cross-reactivity and false-positives; for
example, watermelon and ragweed are cross-reactive.
Measuring both IgG1 and IgG4 together can cause many
unnecessary food eliminations. The IgG4 antibody is,
therefore, a more clinically relevant marker of chronic
food-immune reactions and possible intestinal permeability. IgG4 measurements are less likely to produce
false-positives on in vitro tests. In a similar fashion,
measurement of total IgG tends to produce a high rate of
false-positive reactions.
Although the lack of mechanistic explanations has
delayed its recognition by mainstream medical education, the phenomenon of “hidden food allergies” has
long been recognized by most practitioners of integrative and functional medicine. Previous presumptions
about antibody actions are modified by recent research
findings that provide a more complete picture of the
diversity of antibody and complement system reactions
to food antigens. Food-specific IgG4 antibody testing
was developed to meet the need for a reliable assay that
would help the clinician to assess delayed food sensitivities that produce patient symptoms.

Notes:

delayed food sensitivities develop revolves around the
concept of a “leaky gut.” Ordinarily the digestive tract
will efficiently break down and absorb consumed food
as small molecules, amino acids, simple carbohydrates,
etc., which are, in general, non-antigenic. If, for various reasons not uncommon today, digestion becomes
less efficient and/or the intestinal lining becomes more
permeable to large molecules, the conditions are set for
the development of an IgG response to eaten food. It is
assumed that this “leaky gut” condition allows macromolecular food fragments into the circulation, where
they can stimulate a typical immune response where IgG
is the primary antibody produced to defend the body
against perceived non-self-invaders.
There are four subclasses of IgG, 1 through 4. IgG1
antibodies are the initial IgG class responders to a new
food antigen. IgG2 and IgG3 are generally not produced
to food antigens. They react to cell surface oligosaccharides of viruses and protozoa, respectively. Once IgG1
binds to the antigen, the antibody-antigen complex is
quickly destroyed by the Kupffer cells in the liver and
other macrophages. The IgG1-antigen complex can
also stimulate the complement cascade and attendant
inflammation. This cascade of events is associated with
the general malaise experienced from the inflammatory
response.
Upon continued exposure to the antigen, IgG1
antibody production will “class switch” to IgG4.
Interestingly, IgG4 antigen complex does not activate
the complement cascade. IgG4 is monovalent (can
only bind to one epitope of an antigen at a time) and
can be bi-specific. The Fab regions of the antibody are
specific for two different antigens (see Figure 7.9). All
other IgG subclasses are divalent and monospecific.192
IgG4 acts as a “blocking” agent against the actions of
IgE and can form small complexes as antigen exposure
increases. These IgG4 food immune complexes have
a relatively long half-life and are subject to alterations
that would affect the structure enough to present as a
“new” antigen. It is thought that IgG1 is then produced
to attack this complex. Thus begins a whole new cycle:
IgG1 IgG4 complex modification IgG1 IgG4.
Consequently, the complexes can get larger and larger.
These larger complexes can activate the complement
cascade, initiating inflammatory responses in the body.
It is this inflammatory response to a food that is thought
to be the root cause of symptoms in this type of adverse food reaction. The symptoms resulting from food

Two studies have been published that show significant clinical improvement through food elimination based
on IgG test results. One study examined 114 subjects
with a variety of symptoms. Serum IgG antibodies were
measured for most commonly consumed foods. Patients
eliminated those foods with the highest levels of food-specific IgG, and symptoms were correlated before and after
diet changes. In this study, 71% of all symptoms achieved
at least a 75% improvement following elimination of
these foods.193 Another study looked at 150 patients with
inflammatory bowel disease. Food elimination was based
on elevated serum IgG levels to specific foods. Results
were compared with patients eating a sham diet. After 12
weeks, patients eliminating foods that showed elevated
IgG showed significantly better symptom improvement
compared with patients eating a sham elimination diet.194

The yellow atoms within the colored ellipses represent
cysteine side chains. They are not juxtaposed in the
IgG1 heavy chains, allowing disulfide bridge formation
in the multi-chain complex that produces the stable “Y”
configuration. The corresponding residues in the IgG4
heavy chains form intrachain disulfide bonds, changing
the conformation of the final IgG4 complex. The lack
of cross-chain disulfide bonds allows hybrid complex
formation where the two light chains are different, so they
bind only one antigen (monovalent).192

Test Report Interpretation — Many laboratories
perform food-specific antibody tests in large panels of
up to 100+ foods. This may be somewhat excessive
given the fact that most people eat no more than about
20 different foods. Test interpretation can vary depending on various circumstances described below.
Many IgG4 Reactions: If multiple foods have
strong elevations of IgG4, an intestinal permeability
problem is indicated. This “leaky gut” phenomenon
causes numerous food antigens to permeate into the
bloodstream and present to the immune system’s
lymphocytes, which then respond by generating IgG4
antibodies. High levels may or may not reflect adverse
symptoms. In general, consuming these foods puts the
patient under stress. Avoiding the reactive foods may not
completely solve the health problem since the leaky gut
problem will still exist, and the person will simply make
new antibodies to the new foods leaking into the blood
from the gut. A better approach is to have the patient
eliminate the 3 to 6 most reactive foods and rotate
consumption of the others on a 4-day rotation plan;
that is, don’t eat a food any more frequently than once
every 4 days. By avoiding the most offending foods,
the diminished IgG response can provide an interval of
relative calm from inflammatory propagation of the gut
pathology.195
Nutrients that support the development of intestinal
integrity include 5 to 10 g daily of glutamine, 1 to 3 g
of pantothenic acid daily, and 25 to 50 mg of zinc daily.
The tall columnar epithelial cells of the small intestine
derive most of their energy from oxidation of glutamine,

IgG1

and the pantothenic acid and zinc provide assurance
of support for increased cell mass. It should not be
necessary to maintain this level of support for more than
60 days. The amount of glutamine required may be reduced to 1.5 g doses by adding 10 mg of pyridoxine and
10 mg of α-ketoglutaric acid with each dose. This combination appears to aid the efficiency of epithelial cell
utilization of glutamine.196 Various botanical substances,
such as aloe, chamomile, slippery elm, deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), okra and marshmallow, have a long
traditional history of use for improving gastrointestinal
health, and they generally possess mucilaginous properties that allow for a protective coating of the mucosal
lining, reducing irritation and facilitating the healing
process. Other herbs and plant bioflavonoids may contribute to intestinal healing by providing an antioxidant
and/or anti-inflammatory effect (e.g., ginger, curcumin,
boswellia, quercitin, rutin, hesperidin, etc.).197-208
Moderate Number of IgG4 Reactions: IgG elevations to less than half of the foods routinely consumed
may indicate a less severe intestinal permeability
problem, and steps should be taken as indicated above.
In many cases, total elimination of all of the reacting
foods for 1 month coupled with nutritional support
will ameliorate this condition. Food rotation can also be

of IgE in the blood during the early stages of allergic
food reactions.211 The sequence of events in the GALT
involves antigen presentation that leads to activation
of a class of lymphocytes known as Th2 helper T cells.
These cells secrete cytokines that instruct B lymphocytes
to produce antigen-specific IgE. On antigen recognition, the presence of IgE in their cell membrane causes
stimulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.141
Mast cell histamine release produces symptoms typical
of the allergic response. This mechanism is most often
considered to be associated with inhalant allergies.
In most cases, people will easily recognize an IgEmediated food reaction because the allergic response is
immediate—a person eats a food and has a noticeable,
immediate reaction. One then learns to avoid these foods
in the future. A small percentage of patients can have
reactions to as little as 1 mg of offending food. However,
for most patients, antigen consumption in the range of
30 to 80 mg is required to produce significant IgEmediated response to a food.212 Chronic low exposures
can also cause reactions that are not as noticeable and
can contribute to chronic illnesses not necessarily associated with the allergic food response. Such low-level
IgE responses may contribute to “hidden food allergy,”
causing chronic symptoms unless the person identifies
the foods and eliminates them from the diet.213-215
A cardinal feature of the atopic individual is that
the offending food causes characteristic symptoms of
sneezing, runny nose and itching eyes. Other responses
may be present, but the appearance of the characteristic
symptoms within minutes of exposure to a food is evidence of IgE-mediated allergy. When allergy first developed as a medical specialty, allergists thought the story
ended here. Recent scientific insight acknowledges that
there are other mechanisms of “allergy” that produce
symptoms related to gut-immune responses such as IgG
class of antibody directed at food antigens.

beneficial as symptoms improve. If symptoms return after a resumption of normal eating patterns, the rotation
diet and nutritional support should be continued.
Few IgG4 Reactions: If there are only a few IgG reactions to foods, these should again be eliminated from
the diet to test for involvement in patient symptoms.
In many cases, there will be significant improvement.
Other etiological factors may also be involved in patient
health problems.
No IgG4 Reactions: The absence of reactions in
this test may be due to several possibilities. First, the
gut may be intact and there is no intestinal permeability. Second, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
known to suppress the immune response and IgG4 production. Next, some individuals do not produce IgG4
antibodies to foods as most people do, and they may
compensate for this by producing other IgG subclass
antibodies. Finally, since this test measures the immune
response to exposure of the system to food antigens,
the test will not show a positive reaction if the patient is
not consuming a food for reasons of known intolerance.
Without antigenic stimulation, IgG will not be produced.209 This could give a false-negative result for those
foods not being consumed. The patient should be counseled that a negative result on this test for the food does
not necessarily mean they can eat the food now without
causing a reaction if they are already on an elimination
diet due to known food reactions. Reintroduction of
known food allergens should be done with caution.
The test can be very useful in screening for potential
foods the person is eating on a regular basis that may be
causing adverse physical reactions. Treatment involves
removal of offending foods; digestive aid supplements
of betaine HCl and pancreatic enzymes; oral probiotics and prebiotics for establishing favorable bacterial
populations; oral glutamine, the primary energy source
for intestinal epithelial cells; and supportive nutrients as
described above for attenuation of gut permeability.210
Patients can usually start to reintroduce foods that had
been positive after 6 to 9 months, when other acute
health threats are absent.

Notes:

## IgE Food Antibodies
Individuals prone to developing strong immediate
food allergic responses are called “atopic” and are said
to suffer from allergies. The IgE antibody is the cause
of allergic reactions most frequently seen as inhalant
allergies (e.g., hay fever). Foods can also cause a buildup

## The Microbial Mass

Table 7.5 — Ammonia Producing

After the partially digested food mass (chyme)
leaves the stomach, it moves through the small intestine
past the ileocecal valve and into the colon. It carries
nutrient-rich solutions at neutral pH and at a constant,
warm temperature—conditions perfect for the growth of
microbial populations. Oxygen, another growth factor
for many microbes, is present at very low concentrations. Thus, the populations that predominate are anaerobic. Normal microbial population densities should be
viewed as a continuum, rising from about 104 per mL in
the upper jejunum to over 1012 per mL in the colon.216
Stomach acid and digestive enzymes are major factors
controlling species selection and growth rates in chyme.
The approximate 15 pounds of bacteria resident in a
normal healthy colon constitute a mass that exceeds all
organs in the body except skeletal muscle.
The dynamically perpetuated mass of microbes can
have many beneficial effects. Their presence stimulates
the maintenance of the well-developed villus and its
supporting vasculature and musculature.217 The feces
normally are about three-quarters water and one-fourth
dry solid matter composed of about 30% bacteria, 10 to
20% fat, 10 to 20% inorganic matter, 2 to 3% protein,
and about 30% undigested food roughage.218 This
composition varies as a function of the amount and type
of fiber in the diet. The fat in feces is mostly fat synthesized by bacteria or fat from sloughed off epithelial cells,
though some can come from unabsorbed dietary fat. The
brown color of feces is primarily due to bilirubin derivatives. Products of bacterial action that include indole,
skatole, mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide cause the
odor; these can vary from person to person depending
on their diet and colonic bacterial flora.219

Although colonic bacteria are capable of digesting small amounts of cellulose, the amount of energy
derived from this digested fiber is negligible. Other substances formed as by-products of bacterial activity are
short-chain fatty acids, vitamin K, biotin, vitamin B12,
thiamin and riboflavin.216 Bacterial synthesis of vitamin
B12 is of little significance because it is poorly absorbed
in the colon. On the other hand, bacterial-formed vitamin K is nutritionally relevant. In the absence of vitamin
K-forming bacteria, vitamin K status declines because
dietary vitamin K is normally insufficient.220
Many of the biotransformation products coming
from bacterial metabolism are toxic. Gram-negative
anaerobic bacteria are the principal origin of ammonia
produced from peptides and amino acids. Bacteria may
be classified as high, moderate or low rates of in vivo
ammonia production as shown in Table 7.5. The reduction of their ammonia output when lactulose is added to
the medium accounts for the beneficial effects of lactulose in treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.221 Bacterial

production of ammonia and phenols is suspected of contributing to colon cancer. The normal bacteria in healthy
humans produce markedly increased fecal ammonia and
urinary phenols when humans consume a high-protein
diet.222 The colon has limited ability to detoxify these
bacterial metabolites before passing them to the blood.223
Colonocytes, such as hepatocytes in the liver, contain
cytochrome P450224 and are capable of reduction and
hydrolysis (Phase I reactions). They can also transform
toxic compounds by conjugation with donor substrates
(Phase II reactions). Failure of the colon to properly
detoxify xenobiotics and drugs results in epithelial cell
damage, which has major implications for diseases of the
colon, including cancer.79 Once absorbed, toxins present
general systemic challenges. Microbial metabolic release,
intestinal absorption and systemic distribution of microbial products are illustrated in Figure 7.10

GI Function
The integration of immunologic and microbiologic
concepts can lead to new insight about the origins of
many disorders related to the gut. Reactions that have
been referred to as food allergies may be immune reactions to antigens that arise from bacterial action on
dietary proteins and are better described as enterometabolic disorders.225

## Microbial Population Assessment

The intestinal flora is a complex ecosystem consisting of over 400 bacterial species that greatly outnumber
the total number of cells making up the entire human
body.226 These metabolically active bacteria reside close
to the absorptive mucosal surface and are capable of a
remarkable repertoire of transforming chemical reactions. Any orally taken compound or a compound

entering the intestine through the biliary tract or by
secretion directly into the lumen is a potential substrate
for bacterial transformation.
Anaerobic bacteria are the predominant microorganisms in the human GI tract, outnumbering aerobes by a
factor of 10,000 to 1. The most abundant and beneficial
or benign anaerobes are Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides,
Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Peptococcus and
Peptostreptococcus. Bifidobacterium can comprise up to
25% of the total flora in a healthy adult. A great many
other species are present, but in lesser numbers.227 An
imbalance in proportion and numbers of these species
can be induced by broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
This leads to the dominance of other bacterial species,
including Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Klebsiella,
Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia and fungi, especially
yeasts such as Candida. In health, the upper GI tract
is sparsely populated with microorganisms. The vast
majority of bacteria washed along with saliva from the
oral cavity are destroyed in the stomach by gastric juice.
Those that survive (if sufficiently resistant to gastric
secretions and bile acids) tend to be gram-positive, facultative forms such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Lactobacillus.228 The small intestine constitutes a zone of
transition between the sparsely populated stomach and
the luxuriant bacterial flora of the colon. In the distal
ileum, the concentrations of bacteria increase to 106 to
107 colony-forming units per milliliter.216 Here, gramnegative bacteria outnumber the gram-positive species.
Coliforms predominate and anaerobic bacteria, such as
Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium and Clostridium, are found in large numbers. Beyond the ileocecal valve, the bacterial concentration increases steeply.
Colonic bacteria number between 1011 and 1012 colonyforming units per milliliter of fecal material. Multiple
dramatic shifts in populations of species occur between
the ileocecal valve and the rectum. By the time they are
passed from the body in stools, the large majority of the
bacteria are no longer viable.

The production of microbial metabolic products is greatest
in the transitional gut, where their growth rate is greatest.
As populations reach their upper densities in the transverse
colon, the rate of metabolite production slows and
efficiencies of absorption are lower. Absorbed compounds
are distributed by the circulatory and lymphatic systems to
all tissues of the body where they may have toxic effects.

compounds, while others appear unchanged in urine.

The spectrum of identifiable diseases of intestinal

deconjugates estrogens, increases enterohepatic recirculation of these steroids and decreases their rate of clearance from the body, effectively raising blood estrogen
levels and the risk of breast cancer.236 β-Glucuronidase
and other hydrolytic bacterial enzymes also deconjugate bile acids. Deconjugated bile acids are toxic to the
colonic epithelium and cause diarrhea; they have been
implicated as etiological agents in the development of
colon cancer237 and ulcerative colitis.238

Opportunistic
Overgrowth and Disease

Overgrowth of any one of the more than 400 microbial species in the healthy human gut can produce
adverse clinical effects. Excessive colonization of the gut
by undesirable microorganisms alters the metabolic or
immunologic status of the host.239, 240 When this state
leads to disease or dysfunction, it has been termed “dysbiosis” to distinguish it from the correct balance denoted
as orthobiosis.241 The line between benign opportunistic
overgrowth and infectious diseases is difficult to define
because apparently benign, small numbers of colonyforming units may be detected for pathogens such as
enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.

alone in 1996.229 The treated cases are the acute cases
that are easily recognized. The difficult cases are those
with mild, chronic GI symptoms associated with excess
microbial production of toxins in the intestinal lumen.
The incidence of bacterial overgrowth of the small
intestine increases steeply after age 70.73 Elderly patients
develop malabsorption syndrome secondary to bacterial
overgrowth, often secondary to decreased endogenous
acid production or the use of acid-reducing medications,
placing them at risk of clinically significant nutritional
deficiencies.230
The clinical perspective regarding gut ecology
has shifted with modern cultural changes. In the early
1900s, the Nobel laureate E. E. Metchnikoff put forth
his theory of orthobiosis as a state of health dependent
on the correct balance of life forms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract.231 It was a commonly held belief that eating up to 3 pounds of meat per day was good practice.
Such dietary habits lead to a condition that he termed
“putrefactive dysbiosis.” Diets high in meat and low in
fiber can result in long transit times with undigested
protein reaching the colon.
Modern studies give credence to Metchnikoff’s
hypothesis, showing that numerous toxic chemicals are
generated by the action of colonic bacteria on undigested protein.232 The enzyme urease induced in Bacteroides,
Proteus and Klebsiella species by a high-meat diet hydrolyzes urea to ammonia. This raises stool pH, which is
associated with an increased risk of colon cancer.233 Decarboxylation of amino acids by gut bacteria yields vasoactive and neurotoxic amines, particularly histamine,
octopamine, tyramine and tryptamine, which are absorbed and transported to the liver to be deaminated. In
severe cirrhosis, these amines enter systemic circulation
and contribute to encephalopathy and hypotension or
hepatic failure.234 The bacterial enzyme tryptophanase,
also induced by a high-meat diet, degrades tryptophan
Notes:
Dysbiosis and Inflammatory and
Autoimmune Disease
The provocation of joint inflammation by bowel
infection with salmonella, shigella and yersinia suggests an etiologic link between colonic bacteria and
arthritis.232 Klebsiella and Citrobacter species overgrowth
has also been etiologically linked to inflammatory
arthritities such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing
spondylitis, suggesting strongly that clinical evaluation
of the intestinal environment should play a role in the
assessment and even treatment of such disorders rather
than reliance solely on anti-inflammatory agents and
other symptomatic palliating medications.178, 179, 181, 183,
184, 186
Linkage between Yersinia overgrowth and autoimmune thyroiditis has also been firmly demonstrated due
to cross-reactivity (i.e., molecular mimicry) between
Yersinia surface binding sites and TSH thyroid receptors,
also suggesting gastrointestinal evaluation and optimization may be required for comprehensive management of
autoimmune thyroid disorders such as Graves’ disease
and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.182, 185, 187 Continued research into the role of molecular mimicry and immune

GI Function
complex tissue cross-reactivity may indeed suggest gastrointestinal involvement in a large range of autoimmune
phenomena in the years to come. Healthy immune barrier functions, including mucosal defensins are emerging as factors of prime importance in the maintenance
of proper intestinal flora tolerance and the suppression
of potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with autoimmune-stimulating potential.139, 140

Urinary analysis for compounds produced by
microbes in the gut provides indirect evidence of
overgrowth. Accurate identification of species from
compounds found in urine is generally not possible. By
knowing the relative toxicities of the compounds found
elevated, however, the additional information of metabolic impact from the overgrowth can be weighed, as
explained in the section below titled, “Urinary Markers
of Bacterial Overgrowth.”

## Dysbiosis and SIDS
## Dysbiosis and Colon Cancer

Bacterial putrefaction is very old concept regarding intestinal health.251 The initial observations of odors
from patients consuming high-protein and low-vegetable
diets led to vague presumptions about various maladies associated with the activities of intestinal bacteria.
More recent studies have focused on the well-known
association of diet with cancer, especially large bowel
cancer.252-254 The production of phenolic compounds by
intestinal bacterial action on dietary protein has been
proposed as a potential mechanism connecting lowvegetable diet with increased colon cancer incidence.255
Pure strains of bacteria grown in culture produce either
phenol or p-cresol as shown in Table 7.6. Note that only
Staphylococcus albus shows significant production of both
compounds. All other organisms studied had high specificity for either phenol or p-cresol under those conditions.255 Early studies had also indicated the origin of the
phenols to be unabsorbed tyrosine from dietary protein,
as urinary levels showed systematic increases when

Some sulfate-reducing bacteria in the colon produce
hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the gases responsible for
the unpleasant odor in flatus, and implicated by some
preliminary studies as a contributing factor in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).242-244 SIDS is the third leading cause of death among infants in the United States.245
Colonocyte mechanisms for detoxifying hydrogen sulfide
are often not mature in the infant, resulting in absorption
of this and, potentially, other microbial toxins that have
toxicity comparable to cyanide in rodent studies.245-249
Peak incidence of SIDS is during the 2- to 4-month age
group, which often corresponds to the introduction of
bottle feeding and soy-based formulas. These dietary
changes facilitate changes in the colonic microflora,
which include the colonization of bacteria acting on sulfate.250 Hydrogen sulfide elevations in the circulation can
cause injury to the respiratory center in the brain and
pulmonary edema and potentially sudden death.
Evidence of shifts in microbial populations from
symbiotes to pathogens may be found in urinary markers, exhaled gases or fecal markers. All such evidence
is indirectly related to the growth of organisms in the
gut. Direct evidence requires sampling of intestinal
content without perturbation of the local environment
and performing strictly anaerobic culture growth on a
fresh specimen. Such techniques are not used in routine
clinical practice.
Due to the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in
the colon, isolating colony-forming anaerobes from stool
more than a few hours old is difficult in the laboratory
and often yields misleading results. The new tools of
molecular biology described below will help to overcome
these limitations regarding lower colonic assessment.
The detection of bacteria and yeast overgrowth in regions
of the gut prior to the descending colon is best done by
measuring the levels of specific by-products of microbial
activity in urine, which serves as a type of “fingerprint”
for intestinal overgrowth in the transitional gut.

researchers also demonstrated the lack of human tissue
conversion of benzene into phenol by a trial, amazing
from the modern viewpoint, in which 1.6 g of benzene
was administered to a patient with myelogenous leukemia. These instances of phenolic compound production
from dietary amino acids stand in contrast to the apparently favorable production of similar compounds from
dietary polyphenols as discussed above when plantbased diets are consumed. Such differences may account
for part of the increased degenerative disease incidence
associated with animal protein intake.257

Diagnosis of Gastrointestinal Cancer

The diagnostic sensitivity for plasma M2-PK was evaluated
in 413 cancer patients and 141 patients with nonmalignant diseases. Highly significant discrimination of
tumor patients and controls was found (p = 0.001) for
M2-PK, especially when combined with traditional markers
CEA or CA-72.383

The combination of fecal M2-PK with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and/or CA19-9 in the diagnosis of
colorectal and pancreatic cancer strongly increases the
sensitivity with only a modest loss of specificity.50, 258,
Tumor M2-PK is now commercially available and is
emerging as a valuable part of the diagnostic routine for
GI cancer.

The emergence of the fecal M2-PK marker
has improved the sensitivity of colorectal cancer
diagnosis.258, 259 The key regulator of the metabolic alterations found in tumor cells is the glycolytic isoenzyme
pyruvate kinase type M2. This enzyme is expressed in
all proliferating cells and is universally overexpressed in
tumor cells. During carcinogenesis, a shift in pyruvate
kinase isoenzymes takes place, with less expression of
M1-PK in muscle and brain, L-PK in liver and kidney,
and R-PK in red blood cells, and an overexpression of
M2-PK in all affected tissues. Therefore, increased M2PK is associated with abnormal metabolic states specific
for tumor cells from various tissues, such as gastrointestinal, lung, renal and pancreatic.260-268 The % sensitivities for M2-PK and other cancer markers in diagnosing

The Transitional Gut

the lungs. Excess breath 14CO2 is diagnostic for bacterial
overgrowth of the small intestine. This test has limited usefulness for diagnosing overgrowth in the small
intestine because it is prone to giving excessive numbers
of false-positive and false-negative results, especially in
patients with intestinal motility problems.273, 274

The microbial mass increases from levels around
1 × 105 to counts as high as 1 × 1011 in the region
roughly encompassing the mid-ileum to the transverse
colon. This 6 orders of magnitude increase represents a
fantastically high rate of new cell formation with associated intense metabolic activity where metabolic products
are formed. Thus, it is from this mid- or transitional gut
that most of the microbial products found in breath or
urine are chiefly derived.

Breath Ethanol
Carbohydrate intolerance may be the only symptom
of bacterial overgrowth, making it indistinguishable
from intestinal candidiasis; in either case, dietary sugars
can be fermented to produce endogenous ethanol.275 The
production of ethanol following an oral glucose load was
found in 61% of chronically ill patients. The symptoms
include abdominal distension, carbohydrate intolerance,
fatigue and impaired cognitive function. The majority of
cases are thought to be due to yeast overgrowth.276

Urinary Markers of Bacterial Overgrowth

The intestinal flora can be thought of as a chemical
factory with massive levels of active enzymes. All rapidly
growing bacterial species in the small intestine produce
metabolic by-products. Many of those products that
are not used by competing microbes can be absorbed
and appear in urine either unaltered or as conjugates
produced in hepatic detoxification reactions. These byproducts may be helpful, toxic or benign. The absorbed
products may be utilized for energy immediately in the
epithelial cells of the gut, acted on by the detoxification
systems in the liver or passed into urine unchanged.
The patterns of specific compounds that are detected
in urine allow some deductions about the nature of the
originating organisms.
By the indirect procedure of examining microbial
products in urine, the in vitro growth conditions are
completely unaltered by the assay. Multiple products
may be measured, providing the opportunity to examine
patterns reflective of specific types of overgrowth. Putrefactive dysbiosis may be the result of excessive protein

This test offers reasonable sensitivity, and it is very
convenient to administer, although it will sometimes
give false-negative results. For greater predictive value, it
is best to also obtain a baseline breath sample from the
patient before consumption of the challenge solution.
The fasting patient drinks a challenge dose of lactulose (10 g) or glucose (75 g) solution. Breath samples
should be collected every 15 minutes for up to 2 hours.
If bacteria exist in the small intestine, they will ferment
the sugar and release hydrogen and methane, which
can be detected in the breath. The typical fasting breath
sample contains less than 10 ppm hydrogen or methane;
levels higher than 20 ppm indicate a high probability of
bacterial overgrowth. Following a lactulose or glucose
challenge, a two-phase response may be seen. The first
rise in breath hydrogen occurs within 30 to 60 minutes
when lactulose contacts the small intestine; a second,
more pronounced rise occurs about 2 hours later when
the sugar enters the large intestine. A rapid and prolonged first-phase response is frequently due to small
intestine bacterial overgrowth.269 Interpretation of results
is complicated by the large number of false-positive
findings as compared with results obtained from bacterial cultures of intestinal lumen aspirates.270, 271 Combining the findings of elevated fasting breath hydrogen
(> 20 ppm) and raising the limit for the post-lactulose
challenge increase in breath hydrogen and methane to
greater than 15 ppm reduce the chance of false-positive
responses.272

## Breath Hydrogen and Methane

Notes:

[14C]Xylose Breath Test
For this test, the patient drinks a solution containing [14C]xylose, which is normally absorbed and excreted in the urine. In the presence of excess bacteria in the
small intestine, [14C]xylose is metabolized by bacteria to
form 14CO2, which is absorbed and eliminated through

intake, the overgrowth or imbalance of various bacterial
species or exposure to antibiotics. Bacteria much more
actively metabolize amino acids than yeast, and not all
bacteria carry out the same reactions. Grown under anaerobic conditions, fungi produce unique products that
allow their detection. Many of the microbial products
that appear in the urine are organic acids that have been
further discussed in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” Direct
assay of the microbial mass by stool culture and sensitivity testing is discussed below in the section, “The Colon:
Assessing Microbes in Stool.”

Figure 7.12 — Intestinal Tryptophan Conversion

to Urinary Indican

Urinary indican arises from unabsorbed dietary tryptophan
(Trp). Intestinal bacteria degrade Trp to indole by
successive reactions. Indole is efficiently absorbed and
quickly oxidized to indoxyl in the liver. The final step of
sulfation is carried out in the liver and kidney, producing
urinary indoxyl sulfate (indican).

tophan loading, which can be monitored by measuring
periodic levels of urinary indican, results in neuropsychiatric manifestations due to products of intestinal bacterial conversion of the amino acid.280 When elevations
of phenol and p-cresol are included with that of indican
as criteria of abnormal bacterial colonization of the small
intestine, the number of false-positives is reduced.285
The use of indican results are complicated by impaired protein digestion, which may increase the tryptophan available for bacterial action. The relationship between increased indican and incomplete digestion might
be utilized as a measure of protein digestive adequacy.
Increased urinary indican has been shown to correlate with enteric protein loss.286 Indican elevation has
revealed that impaired protein digestion and increased
bacterial conversion of tryptophan is a complication of
cirrhosis of the liver.287 Some degree of malabsorption
was found in 30% of an elderly population by combinations of indican with the Schilling test, as well as other
tests described below.288

Urinary Indican — Bacteria in the upper bowel
produce the enzymes that catalyze the conversion of
tryptophan to indole (Figure 7.12). Absorbed indole is
converted in the liver to indoxyl, which is then sulfated
to allow urinary excretion as indoxyl sulfate (indican).
An elevated level of urinary indican was reported for
patients with adult celiac disease277 and was demonstrated in 8 of 12 patients following jejuno-ileal bypass
surgery.278
Oral, unabsorbed antibiotics reduce indican excretion. Indican excretion is also reduced when the gut is
populated with strains of Lactobacillus at levels above 105
organisms/g.279 Probiotics have been shown to decrease
indican levels. L. salivarius, L. plantarum and L. casei
were more effective in achieving reduced indican than
were two strains of L. acidophilus.280
Indican testing can differentiate pancreatic insufficiency from biliary stasis as the cause of steatorrhea
(fatty stools). Patients with steatorrhea due to pancreatic
insufficiency show a rise of indican from low values to
above normal when they are treated with pancreatic
enzyme extract.281 When steatorrhea is not due to pancreatic insufficiency, addition of oral pancreatic extract
did not produce higher indican levels.281 This scenario
demonstrates how bacterial populations respond to
increased luminal concentrations of undigested amino
acids. Large shifts in bacterial populations induced by
the artificial sweetener saccharin have also been demonstrated by changes in indican excretion. This effect is
again thought to be related to changes in metabolism of
amino acids by gut flora.282
No age adjustment for reference limits is necessary,
since excretion is constant for young and elderly control
subjects.283 The test may be performed after oral loading
of 5 g tryptophan.284 Reference limits may also be set
from data taken under non-loading conditions. Tryp444

Urinary Phenolic Compounds — Dietary polyphenolics are the principal substrates from which products
of transitional gut bacterial metabolism are formed.
Further discussion of polyphenol substrates may be
found in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” In addition to the

difficile is associated with enterocolonopathies. Cases
of confirmed Clostridium overgrowth show elevated
levels of dihydroxyphenylpropionate, which fall to
baseline with Flagyl treatment, but are unaffected by
nystatin.296 Although other organisms may produce
3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionate, clostridia are the
most commonly encountered genera among those
susceptible to Flagyl. Compounds closely related to
3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionate are produced by the
genus Clostridium.297

Urinary d-Lactate — Another product of bacterial
fermentation of sugar is d-lactic acid. Although d-lactic
acidosis is usually a complication of short-bowel syndrome or of jejuno-ileal bypass surgery (colonic bacteria
being the source of acidosis), elevated levels of d-lactate
were found in blood samples of 13 of 470 randomly
selected hospitalized patients.298 Small intestinal fermentation was a likely cause of d-lactic acidosis in these 13
patients, 60% of whom had a history of gastrointestinal
surgery or disease. One case has been reported to have
d-lactic acidosis 23 years after a jejunal-ileal bypass procedure. The patient presented at that interval from the
surgery with signs of d-lactate encephalopathy, including dizziness, ataxia, confusion, headache, memory loss
and aggressive behavior.299 Elevated d-lactic acid can be
found in cases of overpopulation of the small intestine
with L. acidophilus, as a result of low endogenous stomach acid production or the chronic use of acid-reducing
medications accompanied by ingestion of large quantities of dietary carbohydrate.300

use of polyphenol compounds, intestinal bacteria that
contain l-amino acid decarboxylase enzymes degrade
tyrosine to tyramine. The tyramine is then deaminated
and oxidized to p-hydroxyphenylacetate. This product is
excreted unchanged and unconjugated in urine. It was
used to identify small bowel disease and bacterial overgrowth syndromes in 360 randomly selected, acutely ill
infants and children. In this study, no false-negative and
only 2% false-positive results were found.289 Treatment
with metronidazole or mepacrine has been shown to
eliminate the p-hydroxyphenylacetic aciduria. Although
p-hydroxyphenylacetate can be produced in the liver,
abnormally high levels in urine are of bacterial origin.
Urinary p-cresol increases along with an increase in
fecal ammonia and fecal volatile sulfur substances. The
urinary output of p-cresol is probably due to the action
of colonic bacteria on protein; this is based on observed
urinary p-cresol increases following increases in fecal
short-chain fatty acids and ammonia in people on a
high-protein diet.290
Phenylacetate is one of the compounds that accumulate in the genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU).
The neurotoxicity of phenylacetate is probably due to
very strong inhibition of synaptic choline acetyltransferase.291 Phenylacetate elevation due to dysbiosis has the
same metabolic effects as elevation due to PKU, where
it is linked to behavior and learning disabilities.292 High
urinary benzoate and hippurate have been associated
with intestinal bacterial overgrowth293.

Urinary Tricarballylate — Extensive studies in
animals have shown that tricarballylate in urine comes
from such bacteria in the intestines.294 Species that
produce this compound frequently infect the foregut of
ruminant animals such as cows and may also be present
in humans with dysbiosis. Tricarballylate binds magnesium very tightly and prevents absorption, leading to
magnesium deficiency in rat studies.295 Although further
studies in humans are needed to determine the origins
and dispositions of tricarballylate, the appearance of the
compound in upper population quintile amounts is suggestive of interference with magnesium absorption.

Notes:

Urinary 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylpropionate —
Clostridium species constitute a major portion of the
bacteria of the lower ileum and colon. Being strictly
anaerobic, they are difficult to culture from stool and
are not reported on most stool cultures. Clostridium

small intestinal overgrowth is attributable to the action of
bacterial proteases that degrade pancreatic and intestinal
brush-border enzymes. This causes pancreatic insufficiency and mucosal damage leading to malabsorption.
Candida colonization of the GI tract impairs mucosal barrier defense against gram-negative bacteria.301 Endotoxemia resulting from bacterial overgrowth contributes to
hepatic damage.302
Regular use of antacids reduces the killing of yeast
and bacteria in the stomach, and repeated courses
of antibiotics cause sudden, dramatic reductions in
populations of beneficial bacteria. These conditions set
the stage for increased growth of microbes that produce
toxins instead of nutrients. What was once healthy fermentation can become unfavorable dysbiotic overgrowth
in the upper bowel.70 Clinicians should be watchful for
antacid abuse, which (in conjunction with antibiotic
treatment), can lead to the development of disparate
symptomatology secondary to intestinal dysbiosis
(Table 7.8). This is particularly true for such patients
consuming a diet rich in simple sugars. Responses vary
widely depending on factors of mucosal integrity, immune competence and metabolic function.

As elaborated above, Metchnikoff’s ideas of putrefactive dysbiosis have been recognized for several
decades. More recently, the prevalence of a new type of
dysbiosis has gained recognition. In contrast to putrefactive dysbiosis in the colon, fermentative dysbiosis can be
present in the small intestine. Although colonic fermentation is desirable, the proliferation of yeast, fungi and
fermentative bacteria in the small intestine has detrimental effects. The production of toxic by-products can
overload the detoxification pathways in the liver, and
fungal enzymes can damage the mucosal epithelium.
Opportunities for fermentative dysbiosis are most
apparent following jejunal or ileal resection or jejunoileal bypass surgery, where aerobic and/or anaerobic
colonic organisms were found in jejunal aspirates from
8 of 12 patients.278 Abnormal overgrowth of microbes
occurs in surgical blind loop, intestinal stasis, gastric
hypochlorhydria, and immune and nutritional deficiencies. Bacterial consumption of cobalamin lowers blood
levels of vitamin B12. Bacterial dehydroxylation of bile
salts causes impairment of micelle formation that can
lead to steatorrhea.238 Some of the damage resulting from

GI Function

The population of the microbiota of the human
gastrointestinal (GI) tract is widely diverse and complex, with a high population density. All major groups
of microorganisms are represented. Although they are
predominately bacteria, a variety of protozoa are also
present. In the colon there are over 1011 bacterial cells
per gram and over 400 different species. These bacterial
cells outnumber host cells by at least a factor of 10.310
This microbial population has important influences
on host physiological, nutritional and immunological
processes. In fact, this biomass should more rightly be
considered a rapidly adapting, renewable organ with
considerable metabolic activity and significant influence
on human health. Consequently, there is renewed and
growing interest in identifying the types and activities of
these gut microbes.311
The normal, healthy balance in microbiota provides colonization resistance to pathogens. Since
anaerobes comprise over 95% of these organisms, their
analysis is of prime importance. Gut microbes might
also stimulate immune responses to prevent conditions
such as intestinal dysbiosis. Intestinal dysbiosis may be
defined as a state of disordered microbial ecology that

d-Arabinitol — d-Arabinitol (DA) is a metabolite
of most pathogenic Candida species, in vitro as well
as in vivo. DA is a five-carbon sugar alcohol that can
be assayed by enzymatic analysis. Immunocompromised patients with invasive candidiasis have elevated
d-arabinitol-creatine ratios in urine. Positive DA results
have been obtained several days to weeks before positive blood cultures, and the normalization of DA levels
has been correlated with therapeutic response in both
humans and animals.305, 306
Measuring serum DA allows prompt diagnosis of
invasive candidiasis.306, 307 The somewhat more discriminating elevated urine d-arabinitol-l-arabinitol (DA/LA)
ratio has been found to be a sensitive diagnostic marker
for invasive candidiasis in infants treated in neonatal
intensive care units. Eight infants with mucocutaneous

causes disease.312 Specifically, the concept of dysbiosis
rests on the assumption that patterns of intestinal flora,
specifically overgrowth of some microorganisms found
commonly in intestinal flora, have an impact on human
health. Symptoms and conditions thought to be caused
or complicated by dysbiosis include inflammatory
bowel diseases, inflammatory or autoimmune disorders,
food allergy, atopic eczema, unexplained fatigue, arthritis, mental/emotional disorders in children and adults,
malnutrition, and breast and colon cancer.241, 313

Difficulties in Assessing Intestinal Microbiota
Most studies of microbiota in the GI tract have used
fecal samples. These do not necessarily represent the
populations along the entire GI tract from stomach to
rectum. Conditions and species can alter greatly along
this tract and generally run from lower to higher population densities. The stomach and proximal small intestine
with highly acid conditions and rapid flow contain 103
to 105 bacteria per gram or milliliter of content. These
are predominated by acid-tolerant lactobacilli and
streptococci bacteria. The distal small intestine to the
ileocecal valve usually reaches to 108 bacteria per gram
or milliliter of content. The large intestine generates

viability. This allows continued growth of species during
transport and until the sample is actually plated out for
culture. This growth allows for a significant change in
the balance of microbes present, since some species will
more actively grow at the expense of others, especially
in the presence of oxygen. DNA analysis eliminates this
problem by placing the specimen in formalin vials for
transport. This immediately kills all organisms, freezing
the exact balance present at the time of collection. Since
DNA hybridization techniques detect only the genes
of the microbiota, living specimens are not necessary.
This allows the clinician to develop the most appropriate therapy based on the patient’s true gut microbiota,
resulting in better clinical results.

Microbial Detection with DNA Probes and PCR

One of the most important contributions to molecular biology is the advent of the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). PCR has led to the development of DNA
and RNA-based technologies, enabling the detection of
a single genome of an infectious agent in any body fluid
with improved accuracy and sensitivity. Many infectious
agents that are missed by routine cultures, serological
assays, DNA probes and Southern blot hybridizations
can be detected by PCR. Therefore, PCR-based tests are
best suited for the clinical and epidemiological investigation of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The introduction
of PCR in the late 1980s dominated microbial research
because it was superior to all previously used culture
techniques and the more recently developed DNA probes
and kits. PCR-based tests are several orders of magnitude
more sensitive than those based on direct hybridization
with the DNA probe. PCR does not depend on the ability
of an organism to grow in culture. Furthermore, PCR
is fast, sensitive and capable of copying a single DNA
sequence of a viable or non-viable cell over a billion
times within 3 to 5 hours. The sensitivity of the PCR test
is also based on the fact that PCR methodology requires
only 1 to 5 cells for detection, whereas a positive culture
requires an inoculum equivalent to about 1,000 to 5,000

the highest growth due to longer residence time and
ranges from 1010 to 1011 bacteria per gram or milliliter of
content. This region generates a low redox potential and
high amount of short-chain fatty acids.
Not only does the microbiota content change
throughout the length of the GI tract, but there are also
different microenvironments where these organisms can
grow. At least four microhabitats exist: the intestinal
lumen, the unstirred mucus layer that covers the epithelium, the deeper mucus layer in the crypts between
villi, and the glycocalyx of the epithelial cells.314 Given
this diverse ecological community, the question arises as
to how to sample the various environments to identify
populations of microbes and ultimately understand the
host-microbe interactions. This problem is an extremely
difficult one since any intervention to obtain a sample
potentially disrupts the population. Fecal sampling has
been used for years in microbiota assessment. But it
should be understood that this sample most appropriately represents organisms growing in the lumen of the
colon. In addition, > 98% of fecal bacteria will not grow
in oxygen.314 Therefore, standard culture techniques
miss the majority of organisms present.

Conventional Techniques versus New Technologies

Conventional bacteriological methods such as
microscopy, culture and identification are used for
the analysis and/or quantification of the intestinal
microbiota.315-317 Limitations of conventional methods
are their low sensitivities,318 their inability to detect
non-cultivatable bacteria and unknown species, their
time-consuming aspects, and their low levels of reproducibility due to the multitude of species to be identified and quantified. In addition, the large differences in
growth rates and growth requirements of the different
species present in the human gut indicate that quantification by culture is bound to be inaccurate. To overcome
the problems of culture, techniques based on 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes were developed.319, 320 These
include fluorescent in situ hybridization,321-325 denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis326, 327 and temperature
gradient gel electrophoresis.328 These techniques have
high sensitivities but they are laborious and technically
demanding.
Another problematic issue with present stool
analysis procedures is that of transport. Since analysis
is culture dependent, sample collection must be done
using nutrient broth containers to maintain microbial

cells, making PCR the most sensitive detection method
available.329
Some advantages of PCR amplifications of target
microbial DNA for organism detection over traditional
culture techniques are:
• Ability to detect non-viable organisms that
are not retrievable by culture-based methods
• Ability to detect and identify organisms
that cannot be cultured or are extremely
difficult to grow (e.g., anaerobes)
• More rapid detection and identification
of organisms that grow slowly
(e.g., mycobacteria and fungi)

• Ability to detect previously unknown
organisms directly in clinical specimens
by using broad-range primers

Parasitology is yet another field of microbiology to
be greatly improved with molecular technologies. Parasite infections are a major cause of non-viral diarrhea,
even in developed countries. Classically, parasites have
been identified by microscopy and enzyme immunoassays.330 In recent studies, molecular techniques have
proven to be more sensitive and specific than classic
laboratory methods.330-332 Because Giardia cysts are shed
sporadically and the number may vary from day to day,
laboratories have adopted multiple stool collections to
help increase identification rates for all parasite examinations.331 And, even with the advent of antigen detection
systems, there has long been uncertainty in diagnosis
when no ova or parasites are found. Due to the nearly
100% sensitivity and specificity of DNA analysis combined with the need for very low amounts of genomic
DNA (as low as 2.5 cells per gram),331 the previously
long specimen collection process, laborious and technically challenging microscopy, and resulting delays in reporting have been alleviated. With PCR technology, only
one fecal sample is all that is needed for high sensitivity
and specificity in parasitology examinations.

Laboratories that make the transition to molecular
diagnostics will become a more integral part of hospital operations, as they can prove the value of their
improved services. The clinical microbiology laboratory
is transitioning into the molecular age. From pathogen
and antibiotic resistance identification to screening tests,
rapid molecular diagnostics are playing an increasingly
important role in diagnosing and preventing infections
and improving overall hospital operations. As physicians, pharmacists and even hospital administrators
demand rapid microbiology results, many laboratories
are focusing on being part of cross-functional implementation teams that assure not only that the new tests are
implemented efficiently, but also that the results affect
real change for patient management, hospital operations
and laboratory efficacy.
The combination of stool microbial profiling and
urinary microbial metabolic product profiles can provide
an even more powerful routine evaluation of intestinal
microbial status. Populations in the upper regions dominate the metabolic markers in urine while stool specimens reflect the high-density populations of the colon.
Case Illustration 7.1 provides an example of the dual
application of both approaches in clinical practice.

Antibiotic-Resistant Genes
The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotic
drugs involves an active change or mutation in the microbial genome, which changes the microbe’s metabolic
or structural responsiveness to the mechanism of the
drug’s action. This genetic change is passed in the population as cells replicate. This genetic material can also be
passed on to other strains of bacteria through plasmid
sharing. The development of antibiotic resistance is
becoming a serious public health issue as overuse of antibiotics continually selects for mutated strains that have
developed resistance.
The human intestinal microbiota represents over
400 species. All antibiotic resistance strategies that bacteria develop are encoded in one or more genes. These
genes are readily shared among and across species and
genera and even among distantly related bacteria. These
genes confer resistance to different classes of drugs, and
their sequences are known. Therefore, using PCR techniques, they can be readily detected in large populations
such as those found in fecal material.
The knowledge of the presence of a drug resistance
gene may be quite significant for the clinician when considering treatment of a patient for a pathogen infection.

Intestinal Microbiota Associated with Obesity
There are two predominant bacterial groups in the
human GI tract, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Recent research has discovered a relationship between the balance
of these groups and obesity. Gastrointestinal bacteria
have evolved, in a sense, independently from the host
organism, in some cases performing functions that the
host has consequently not had to evolve itself. One of
these functions is the breakdown of dietary polysaccharides for conversion into energy.
Firmicutes bacteria, which include Bacillus,
Clostridium and Lactobacillus species, are very efficient
at metabolizing plant polysaccharides into monosaccharides and short-chain fatty acids. These can then be absorbed by the gut and converted to more complex lipids
in the liver. In addition, this group secretes a compound
that results in increased activity of lipoprotein lipase in
adipocytes, resulting in enhanced storage of these lipids.
The Bacteroidetes group, which includes Bacteroides and
Prevotella species, are not as efficient in this function.
Consequently, the balance of these two groups, it has
been found, can significantly affect the accumulation
of fat stores in the body. Although obesity ultimately is
caused by excess caloric intake, differences in gut microbial ecology may be an important component of energy
homeostasis. In effect, obese individuals may have populations of microbiota that force a more efficient extraction and storage of energy than lean individuals possessing a different balance of microbiota.

A Bacteroidetes decrease relative to Firmicutes in
the gut has been associated with significant accumulation of body fat both in humans and experimental
animals. When germ-free mice are inoculated with this
imbalance of microbiota, they have significantly greater
accumulations of total body fat and increased insulin
resistance. Similar animals inoculated with the better
balance remain lean, even though they are eating diets
that are exactly the same. Obese versus lean humans also
show similar makeup in bacterial groups. Lean individuals have a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes relative
to Firmicutes than obese individuals. Interestingly, if
obese humans are put on low-carbohydrate or lowfat diets and lose weight, their microbial balance also
improves.335-338
This concept of microbiota being linked to obesity
raises some interesting possibilities. Studies are ongoing
to explore this relationship. The use of specific diets or
pre- and probiotic therapies may be able to significantly
affect microbial balances that affect fat storage. The ability to assess the balance of these “fat bugs” in humans
will potentially be an important advance in contributing to the resolution of a significant public health issue,
namely obesity.

For example, suppose a pathogen is detected in a stool
analysis. An analysis of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes is also performed on the sample. Subsequent
drug sensitivities are then run on the pathogen and it
is found to be sensitive to two antibiotics. But suppose
there is also a drug resistant gene present in the sample
to one of the drugs (a very possible scenario). It would be
imperative, then, that this drug is not used in treating the
patient. Otherwise, even though the pathogen is killed the
other organisms that have the gene conferring resistance
to the drug would thrive relative to other microbes present. This would set up a potentially dangerous situation,
where antibiotic resistance is maintained in the population
because that gene can be readily spread to other organisms
present in the individual as well as the environment.333, 334
Knowledge of the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in
fecal specimens, therefore, represents a significant advance
in the treatment of patients and maintenance of health.
Microbial Metabolic Markers
from Stool Testing
Fecal β-Glucuronidase
Bacterial β-glucuronidase is an enzyme that can
effectively reverse detoxification that has taken place in
the liver during the Phase II conjugation reactions (see
Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification”). Bacterial
flora may express large amounts of glycosidase enzyme
activity, the principal glycosidase being β-glucuronidase.
A report showing high levels of β-glucuronidase calls
attention to the need to restore beneficial bacterial populations and to the potential for greater enterohepatic
circulation that can affect metabolites such as estrogen
(see Chapter 10, “Hormones”).
Glycosides are compounds containing a non-sugar
molecule (aglycone) attached to a sugar derivative
such as glucuronic acid by α- or β-glycoside linkage.
Glycosides enter the GI tract through dietary intake
or from the liver through bile secretions. Most dietary
glycosides, predominately flavonoids, come from
vegetables and fruits. Glycosides coming from the
liver include toxic compounds that are inactivated by

GI Function
β-glucuronide formation and subsequently secreted into
the bowel by way of the bile. The intestinal flora can
hydrolyze the β-glucuronide bond, leading to release
of the toxic compound, which may be carcinogenic.
Therefore, excess β-glucuronidase activity in the small
bowel, often due to elevations in certain bacterial
populations, is associated with increased risk of cancer,
including estrogen-related cancers. The cleavage of
glucuronide from estrogen metabolites leads to their
increased enterohepatic recirculation.339-343

Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)

Notes:

The colonic microbial mass converts food components into organic acids and amines according to
the nature of the substrate passing into the colon and
the type of organisms that predominate. A high rate of
organic acid production gives acidic stools, whereas low
acid formation with increased amines results in higher
pH of stool. One of the most important colonic health
practices is regular intake of high fiber foods so that
beneficial organisms in the colon receive substrate for
the production of favorable products such as butyric
acid. Direct measurement of fecal pH provides an overall
indicator of acid and base balance.
Abnormally acidic or alkaline pH of the stool may
be an indicator of poor digestive health. There is increasing evidence that fecal pH can serve as a marker for
colon cancer.233, 344-346 High fecal pH, however, is only
indirectly associated with the development of colon cancer and, therefore, is a secondary, rather than a primary,
measure of cancer risk.344 High stool pH appears to correlate with low levels of short-chain fatty acids (especially butyric acid).347-350 Alkalinity and low butyric acid
levels in the stool appear to signal inadequate intake or
digestion of fiber, and possibly low levels of beneficial
colonic flora.
Various patterns of simultaneous elevation of
multiple bacterial and protozoal by-products in urine
are found in putrefactive dysbiosis that is also characterized by lowered ratio of Bifidobacteria to Bacteroides,
the major genera of the anaerobic organisms. Fecal pH
may be elevated, and β-glucuronidase increases. This
scenario has been linked to increased occurrence of
colon and breast cancer (possibly due to deconjugation of estrogen-glucuronide complexes) and hepatic
encephalopathy.310

Fecal pH

Frequently, disorders of the GI tract are associated
with intestinal malabsorption. Many tests are useful in
the diagnosis of GI disorders but do not effectively differentiate abnormalities of absorption (mucosal function) from digestion (pancreatic function). The fecal
short-chain fatty acid test can be helpful in making a
differential diagnosis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are
formed from bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates and amino acids that escape absorption in the
small bowel. An alteration in the proportion of various
SCFAs, which stay constant in healthy colons, signifies
an impaired state of colonic health.351
Short-chain fatty acids are well absorbed by the
colon and are a significant source of energy for colonic
cells. The short-chain fatty acid n-butyrate plays a notable role for maintaining colonic health—a decrease of
n-butyrate oxidation by colonic epithelial cells may be a
key factor in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.352, 353
High acetic acid and low butyric acid in relation to total
SCFAs in the feces are found in patients with large bowel
adenomas and cancer.354 The fecal content of n-butyrate—formed by the bacterial fermentation of fiber—is
particularly critical for colonic health since it is such an
important source of energy for the epithelial cells of the
colon.217 Research suggests that inadequate amounts of
colonic n-butyrate could be a primary factor in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and
colon cancer.355

The SCFA products of bacterial fermentation (or
putrefaction), isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acids,
come principally from undigested protein.356, 357 These
SCFAs are normally present at low concentrations in
the healthy colon. However, maldigestion of protein
due to pancreatic enzyme insufficiency can result in
excess protein entering the colon. In these cases, fecal
isobutyric acid, valeric acid and isovaleric acid will be
elevated. Their presence is more likely due to a pancreatic dysfunction rather than an inadequacy of mucosal
absorption.

mutagenic fecapentaenes have been elucidated,364 and
methods for quantification of eight specific fecapentaens
in human feces have been published.365-367 Some researchers have proposed that the widely varying ratios of
two principal fecapentaenes can be traced to individual
differences in intestinal flora.368 Bacteroides have been
identified as the source of fecapentaenes in a human
autopsy study.369 With the advent of more broad species
identification using 16S DNA identification techniques,
there is potential for more closely identifying the organisms in the general population with capacity for fecapentaene production.

Fecal Phenolics
Ammonia

The indications of ammonia loading of hepatic and
renal detoxification pathways by elevation of urinary
orotate, citrate, cis-aconitate and isocitrate have been
discussed in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” When normal
subjects are shifted from low to high animal protein
diets, their fecal nitrogen does not increase significantly,
indicating that the increased dietary nitrogen is metabolized by intestinal microbes and the ammonia produced
is absorbed rather than turned into bacterial protein.222
Direct evidence of the contribution of intestinal ammonia production is of great concern for patients being
treated for hepatic coma. Such patients may be significantly improved by treatment with non-absorbed oral
antibiotics such as neomycin or kanamycin. Use of the
drugs eliminates intestinal bacterial urease production
in most hepatic coma patients.370 Aerobic and anaerobic
cultures from these patients failed to show changes in
the number of deaminating bacteria, though urease-producing colonies were virtually eliminated. However, 3 of

In Chapter 6, “Organic Acids,” it was pointed out
that most of the phenolic products are derived from
microbial action on dietary polyphenols. The interpretation of an abnormal value for urinary phenols, therefore, must deal with the possibility that the elevation is
simply a manifestation of very high dietary polyphenol
intake. One way to correct or normalize data for polyphenol intake is to measure the level of intake. Dietary
surveys may be employed, but they are notoriously inaccurate and laborious. Another approach is to measure
compounds in fecal water that are markers of intake.
Dietary phenolic intakes corresponded closely to fecal
water polyphenol concentrations in 5 healthy human
subjects, and 7 of the polyphenols measured constituted
over 90% of total fecal polyphenols. When monophenols were measured, 10 of the many compounds present represented the great majority of monophenols.358
Phenylacetate was the dominant component in fecal
water. Measuring fecal phenylacetate may allow estimation of dietary polyphenol intake while simultaneously
providing a marker for the cancer-protective effects.
This method and the alternative of assessing simultaneously measured bacterial products that are not derived
from dietary polyphenols are discussed in Chapter 6,
“Organic Acids.”

Fecapentaenes
Fecapentaenes are polyunsaturated ether lipids that are derived from human intestinal bacterial
plasmalogens that have similar ether linkages.359 (See
Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids,” for a discussion of plasmalogens.) Fecapentaenes cause DNA damage and mutations
in human cells,360, 361 and they are found in human feces
where they are thought to play a role in the initiation of colorectal cancer.362, 363 The structures of highly

in responses to such therapy. Very active ammonia generation from non-urea sources (presumably amino acids)
has been demonstrated in fecal suspension cultures from
normal subjects.371 These data demonstrate the capacity
of intestinal bacteria for ammonia production. They also
suggest that, although urease-producers persist into the
lower colon, deaminating bacteria may inhabit the upper intestinal regions but not be seen in stool cultures.

Evaluation of gastrointestinal function includes
detection of inadequate physical and immune barrier
functions and measures of the digestion and absorption
of food. Pathogenic overgrowth of intestinal microbes in
the upper gastrointestinal tract can be detected by measuring their unique products in urine. The patterns reflect the type of organisms that are present within broad
categories of bacteria, protozoa or yeast. The information
allows discrimination between putrefactive dysbiosis
in the colon versus fermentative dysbiosis in the small
intestine or combinations of both. The number of compounds involved, and the degree of elevations found,
change in direct proportion to the severity of pathogenic
overgrowth and loss of mucosal integrity. Stool profiling

observation of microbial populations and can suggest
specific antimicrobial therapies when necessary.

of the efficacy of repopulation with favorable species
of lactobacilli,373 especially with the introduction of
antibiotic-resistant strains.374 The consumption of nonabsorbed, fermentable carbohydrates, such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin, stimulate growth of the
genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.375 These forms
of carbohydrate are found in onion, garlic, chicory, Jerusalem artichoke and wheat.
Insoluble fiber lowers yeast, Clostridium, Staphylococcus and Proteus in stool cultures and lowers output
of ammonia and phenols.376 Both butyrate enemas and
increased dietary soluble fiber have shown potent antiinflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro.377 Shifting
from a conventional diet to an uncooked vegan diet has
been shown to reduce urinary p-cresol due to a decrease in bacterial enzymes.378 Small intestinal mucosal
regeneration can be aided by intake of supplemental
glutamine, the primary energy source for this tissue. The
colon mucosa utilizes butyrate, which can be supplied
as an enema. Restoration of immune function is aided
by deglycyrrhizinated licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), a
stimulant of goblet cell formation.379 Essential fatty acid
balance is needed to assure adequate prostaglandin
formation. Deficiencies of essential fatty acids impair the
