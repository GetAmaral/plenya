A New Role for
Clinical Laboratories

This disease, so frequently attending all long
voyages, and so particularly destructive to us, is
surely the most singular and unaccountable of any
that affects the human body. For its symptoms are
inconstant and innumerable, and its progress and
effects extremely irregular: for scarcely two persons have the same complaints, and where there
is found some conformity in symptoms, the order
of their appearance has been totally different.
However, though it frequently puts on the form
of many other diseases, and is therefore not to be
described by any exclusive and infallible criterions
(Chaplain Richard Walter, Anson’s Voyages Around
the World in the Years 1740–1744).

One lesson in medicine we have learned over the
last century is that our successes often give rise to new
challenges. Tremendous strides in reducing mortality
from acute illness and extending life expectancy have
yielded an increase in chronic, degenerative diseases
among the aging population.1 The power of antibiotics in saving lives has encouraged the hope of a “magic
bullet” for treating symptoms, a model that has, to a
large extent, failed to produce the same success with
diseases that are multifactorial in origin and chronic
in nature. Additionally, the very use of these drugs has
created “super bugs” resistant to antibiotics.2 Advances
in food production and distribution have resulted in an
abundance of processed foods altered from their original
form and that have low nutrient-to-calorie ratios. Technological progress has created literally thousands of new
chemicals that challenge the environment and our own
metabolic processes.3
As more of the world’s population experiences the
benefits of our successes, overcoming the new challenges we have created requires a broader, more holistic
approach that takes into account the web-like interconnectedness of human metabolism and its relation to the
environment. The human body has great capacity to
adapt to change, heal, and express its genetic potential
if it is provided the raw materials—the basic macronutrients, micronutrients, and conditionally essential
nutrients-that it requires for healthy metabolic function.
What should become routine application of these principles to general patient care is already being done by
some practitioners. In the U.S., they tend to be catagorized as practicing integrative or functional medicine.
Nutrition may be the single most influential component of health maintenance, since diet is a determining
factor in many diseases, including obesity, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, cirrhosis of the
liver, childhood developmental and behavioral disorders,
and celiac disease.4,5 Yet optimal nutrition, the level of
nutrient intake that maintains the best possible health, is
highly variable from person to person.6 The concepts of
biochemical individuality and the genetotrophic theory of
disease, as first described by Roger Williams, the discoverer of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), continue to exert a
major influence on this emergent model of human health
and the development of integrative functional medicine.

Biochemical individuality influences not only the
individual need for nutrients, but also the expression of
nutrient insufficiency.7 Although this has been recognized for centuries, the concept has been virtually
ignored by the current medical system. Diseases such as
beriberi, pellagra, and scurvy, all single-nutrient deficiency diseases, are often thought of as specific sets of
symptoms and disease progressions. This, however, is
not the case. Biochemical individuality plays a key role
in the expression of functional deficits as they develop,
even in a single-nutrient deficiency disease. An excerpt
from an account by the chaplain aboard Commodore
Anson’s British sailing ship HMS Centurion, which voyaged around the world from 1740 to 1744, and where
626 of 961 men died of scurvy, illustrates that even
centuries ago this was apparent:

Because most essential nutrients play such fundamental roles in cellular metabolism, as insufficiencies
develop, the effects can be system wide. Variation in
disease expression is exponentially compounded when
multiple nutrient deficiencies are involved, which is
often the case in the chronic degenerative diseases.
Any and every aspect of body function can potentially
become compromised, depending on the patient’s own
unique biochemical expression.
The corollary of this situation is that nutritional and
metabolic evaluations of patients with chronic illnesses
also exhibit this variation, making it difficult to define
a disease by any set of laboratory markers. That is, different illnesses may have very similar nutrient deficits.
Conventional wisdom in diagnostic medicine requires
that each diagnosed disease have its own unique set of


vitamin C deficiency in scurvy are reversed once the
patient is replete in the vitamin. This concept expresses
the fundamental assumption of this book: that underlying all diseases are nutrient and/or toxicity factors that
either cause or complicate the disease process.
In this book the terms “deficiency” and “insufficiency” are often used interchangeably. In general,
however, “deficiency” relates to frank dietary deficiency
disease conditions (i.e., pellagra, scurvy, beriberi),
whereas “insufficiency” is used to express non-optimal
nutrient status that can adversely affect function. In most
cases the clinicians in developed countries are dealing

signs, symptoms, and laboratory indicators. Diabetics
exhibit elevated blood glucose, prostate cancer patients
have elevated serum PSA, and elevated white blood cells
can indicate an infection. This same thinking has been
applied to the diagnosis of various chronic disorders. Is
there a metabolic or nutritional deficit pattern to fibromyalgia that would distinguish it from chronic fatigue or
autistic spectrum disorders?
Since nutrient insufficiencies affect multiple organ
systems in ways dependent on the history and genetic
makeup of each patient, one would expect varying outcomes for similar patterns of nutrient depletions, rather

with nutrient insufficiency and not deficiency disease.
Although the classic nutrient deficiency diseases are not
usually seen in developed countries, the need for additional nutrient supplementation for optimal function can
be clearly demonstrated for many conditions.6 Homocysteinemia, for example, is treated with high doses of
vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12. In this case, there is
an insufficiency of these nutrients to provide optimal
homocysteine metabolism. This example illustrates the
need for nutrients in sufficient amounts, usually higher
than RDA levels, to maintain optimal function. When a
broader definition of “deficiency” as any state in which
dietary intake has failed to meet demand is used, both
patients with vitamin B12-responsive homocysteinemia
and those with anemia due to poor vitamin B12 intake
are deficient in vitamin B12.6
Once the concept of nutrient insufficiencies manifesting as the etiology of chronic illness is understood,
the relevant clinical question is how best to detect early
states of insufficiency to restore and maintain function
and wellness. We have attempted to compare clinical
laboratory evaluations with regard to the sensitivity for
detecting early states of nutrient depletion. Biochemical
pathways involving large flux of metabolites are generally the first stage at which nutrient effects are seen. There
is a progression from this stage to the end organ failure

than clear definitive patterns of nutrient status with each
chronic illness. Decades of experience with nutritional
and metabolic profiling calls into question the validity of
categorizing and labeling chronic illness with a diagnosis, since there does not appear to be a unique set of
diagnostic laboratory criteria matching a specific disease
diagnosis. A specific chronic illness is not diagnostically
defined by a unique set of laboratory values (e.g., elevated glucose is diagnostic of diabetes). Consequently, the
clinician is not really treating, for example, fibromyalgia,
chronic fatigue, and inflammatory bowel, but rather
the individual nutritional and metabolic imbalances
and toxicities that prevent normal function. These are
expressed in each person as a different set of symptoms,
perhaps the weakest links in a person’s genetic makeup.
Toxic lead exposure, for example, may be expressed in
some individuals as inflammatory disorders, in others
as immune disorders, and still others as neurological
disorders.8,9 Disease labels are conveniences that allow
reductionism so our minds can categorize treatments;
yet this labeling has inhibited our ability to effectively
treat nutrient-related disorders. Patients are better served
by approaching chronic disease as a manifestation of
underlying nutritional and metabolic imbalances and/or
toxicities. Correction of the imbalances yields elimination of the disease, just as the various expressions of

homocysteine measured using a post-column ninhydrin
derivatization liquid chromatographic method is much
less sensitive than other pre-column derivatization methods.10 Both methods produce a result for the analyte,
but clinically relevant values are less than the limits of
detection for the former method. Further, improvements
in analytical instrumentation, such as tandem mass spectrometry, will allow measurement of analytes at very low
concentrations that were not possible previously.11 This is
opening up a whole new area of environmental chemical
toxicology and body burden assessment.

that is usually observed when a classic diagnosis is
made (Figure 1.1).
Initial conditions of insufficiency are seen at a
biochemical level often without any overt symptom
expression. This is why asymptomatic and symptomatic
individuals may have similar laboratory markers for
nutrient insufficiencies and metabolic imbalances. As
the duration of the insufficiency increases, additional
changes appear in cellular function that can be seen as
subclinical manifestations such as behavioral and mental/emotional instabilities. As the insufficiency progresses
into later stages, morphological and functional changes
occur that can be defined as early stage disease. Finally,
diagnosed pathology is expressed with end organ failure
and ultimately death.
Many factors influence nutrient status in the individual (Figure 1.2), such as diet, digestion, absorption,
disease states, age, medications, stress, toxic exposures,
activity levels, genetics, and biological differences. Laboratory tests can provide valuable indicators of many for
these factors.

Issues in Assessment
Not all tests for any particular analyte are equivalent,
so it is important for the clinician to be aware of four
variables involved in testing: the analyte, the specimen,
patient preparation, and instrumentation. The analyte can
be a nutrient, toxicant, or metabolic control molecule.
The choice of specimen, such as blood, urine, stool, hair,
or other tissue, is critical to the interpretation and clinical
utility. Preparation of the patient is critical. Is the patient
fasting? Was a challenge compound used? Has the patient
been taking a nutrient that is being measured? And,
finally, the analytical method itself can affect the sensitivity and specificity of the measurement. For example,

## Static Measurements

As is the case with every laboratory measure, the
physiology of the body needs to be taken into account
when interpreting a laboratory value. A blood glucose
level, for example, is interpreted differently depending on the time of the last meal. In addition, because
nutrient insufficiency is initially expressed at the
metabolic level, blood levels are often normal in early
insufficiency stages, so measurements can be misleading
for certain nutrients. Magnesium, for example, is found
primarily intracellular with only 1% of body magnesium
found in the serum, and its level is tightly regulated.
Consequently, serum levels of magnesium, which change
only after there is a significant depletion in the tissues,
is not the best measurement when the purpose is to
evaluate magnesium insufficiency in a patient.12 This is
often the case when the nutrient is primarily intracellular. Serum vitamin E, on the other hand, provides a
useful measure of nutrient status, since a considerable
portion of total body vitamin E resides in serum because
Notes:

## Nutrient Concentrations and Biochemical Markers

Direct measurement of nutrients in blood or urine
is the most obvious way to assess patient nutrient status.
Clinically useful information about essential amino acids
and some vitamins and mineral elements is gained in
this way. Blood levels, however, may be sustained during periods when tissue demands are not being met.
Measuring biochemical markers that respond to cellular
metabolic restriction owing to nutrient insufficiency can
provide more sensitive criteria of status. Thus, serum
vitamin B12 may be normal while serum or urinary
methylmalonate is elevated, indicating insufficiency of
vitamin B12 for cellular functions.
Measurements of intermediary metabolite elevations are functional assays, since they detect the failure
of a nutrient-dependent metabolic pathway. As with the
stimulation assays, these functional markers are assessing only one nutrient-dependent metabolic biochemical
reaction and may not give a complete picture of nutrient need at other steps because of genetic polymorphic
effects on individual enzyme structures. Better overall
assessment of nutrient need may be obtained when multiple metabolites are assessed that use the same cofactors
for their metabolism, as is the case in B vitamin insufficiency states and multiple ketoacid elevations. Different
dehydrogenase enzymes metabolize various ketoacids.
Elevation of several ketoacids is a strong indicator of a
global B vitamin insufficiency state decreasing the function of multiple enzymes.

Methods of Assessment

it protects blood lipids from oxidation. Other macronutrient sources, such as amino acids and fatty acids, are
dynamically metabolized in the body. Fasting plasma
measurements of these nutrients reach a level of homeostatic stability that allows for consistent interpretation of
data in repeat testing. Toxic metals and other chemicals
in serum can be useful as indicators of an ongoing exposure, but are not necessarily reflective of the total body
burden of the toxicant.13–15
Clinical interpretation of hormonal assessments is
particularly problematic. Although this book does not
exhaustively address this area, many clinicians using
nutritional therapies regularly assess various hormonal
issues that can affect function. Hormone levels that vary
over time need to be assessed appropriately. Serum levels
taken at different points in time may be a better indicator of proper function than a one-time measure. The use
of 24-hour urine obviates the need for multiple blood
draws, since it is used to measure total daily output. Salivary hormone levels may be valid for certain hormones
and not others. Again, timing is an issue. Consideration
of the physiological functioning of the hormone being
assessed should always be a factor in determining useful
and reliable laboratory testing procedures.

The following discussion of possible strengths and
limitations of various standard laboratory approaches to
assessment provides the methodological background for
more detailed chapters that follow.

## Enzyme Stimulation Assays

Intracellular enzyme stimulation assays were developed to provide a more reliable, functional indication
of nutrient needs. However, usually only one enzyme is
assayed for a particular vitamin cofactor, such as erythrocyte transketolase for thiamin insufficiency or glutathione
reductase for riboflavin insufficiency.16 One drawback to
this type of assessment is that not all enzymes that require the cofactor are measured. Other enzymes that use
the same cofactor may need more or less of the essential
nutrient. Genetic or toxicant effects will not be detected
by measuring only one enzyme activity. Multiple metabolite screening increases the probability of detecting point
weaknesses. The concept of employing large metabolite
profiles during initial screening as a clinical approach to
optimizing individual patient function is central to the
discussions in this book.


Loading Tests or Saturation Measures
Tests that measure the retention of a nutrient load
may utilize the dry-sponge concept; that is, if a nutrient is
deficient or needed by the tissues, more will be retained
by the body and less excreted on loading than in the nutrient-replete condition. Magnesium loading, then, is more
a functional need assessment tool, giving the clinician a
better picture of the sufficiency status of the patient.17

## Challenge Tests
Chelation mobilization tests for toxic metals are
useful to assess the body burden for a toxic element.
This is a way to evaluate the need for detoxification
treatments for patients with chronic illnesses. When
a water-soluble challenge compound is administered
orally, it has primary impact on the liver and kidney.
Thus, these tests reveal primarily hepatic and renal toxic
metal status. The use of challenge compounds to assess

a specific metabolic pathway is particularly valuable,
as it allows the clinician to directly assess how well a
particular critical biochemical system function is operating. Caffeine clearance, acetaminophen, and salicylate
challenges have proven valuable in assessing important
detoxification pathways. Loading with methionine before homocysteine testing may enhance the sensitivity of
detecting homocysteinemia.18

Complicated analytical instruments are often used to
measure specific compounds. Antibody assays may be
used, and many of the tests are developed in-house by
the lab, as opposed to purchasing a manufactured kit
to do an analysis. What follows is a brief description of
principal instruments used to perform the simultaneous
multiple analyte assessments discussed in this book.

The assessment of nutritional and toxicological
factors in health care would not be complete without an
evaluation of the digestive tract. Stool analysis does not
fit handily into any of the above categories, yet information gained from the stool can be very useful clinically.
Microscopic and chemical analysis of stool reflects the
efficiency of the digestive tract, nutritional status, or an
inflammatory condition. Microbiological assessment examines the balance of gut ecology, which can have an important impact on health. Toxic metabolites from certain
microflora overgrowing in the gut can be measured in
the urine.19 Culture and sensitivity measures provide the
clinician with the information to restore normal microflora balance. New gene-based identifications of intestinal microbes have replaced standard culture techniques.
Food itself can have a significant negative impact
on health if a patient is allergic or intolerant to the food.
Analysis of the immunologic responses to foods has
been very useful in determining clinically significant
allergies and intolerances. Serum antibody measures for
both immediate and delayed sensitivity reactions and
provide the clinician with useful data to guide diet and
nutritional recommendations.
Another area of rapid recent growth has been in
the field of genomics. Susceptibility for diseases is often
genetic in nature and much research is now being aimed
at defining how the human genome is involved. Testing
for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
chromosomes that define relative risks are an increasingly
important part of nutritional and preventive medicine.
Nutrition can play a major role in the modification of risk
once the genetic tendencies are identified.20–22

Hyphenated Instrumentation — Instruments that
perform multiple analyte analyses must first handle necessary separations to isolate a compound of interest and
then allow reproducible measurement of the amount of
substance present in the specimen. These systems are
composed of two separate instrument types coupled
together to take advantage of the strengths of combined
separation and detection techniques. They are known as
“hyphenated instruments.” In the past, a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer was abbreviated
as GC-MS. More recently, the forward slash (/) instead
of the hyphen is normally used, but the description
as hyphenated is still used. Thus, GC-MS has become
GC/MS, representing the method of gas chromatography
with mass spectrometric detection. For our discussions,
such abbreviations will also be used. Short descriptions
of common instrument types, how they work, and their
strengths and weaknesses in the analysis of biological
samples are provided here.

Other Procedures
## Instrumentation
Many of the tests discussed in this book are referred
to as high-complexity tests in the clinical laboratory
industry. This means the assays are not performed as routine automated tests, as are most blood chemistry profiles.

## GC/MS
Theory: A GC/MS is a gas chromatograph coupled
to a mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph works
by separating volatile molecules by their boiling points
and their varying rates of migration through a very-smalldiameter capillary column. The columns are available
with a wide variety of coatings that have characteristic
affinities for the compounds being separated. Gas chromatography offers superior performance in separation of
closely related molecules. This is largely due to the separation mechanism and the length of the column used for the
separation; a typical GC column is 30 to 60 meters long.
The ability of GC to separate multiple compounds
usually exceeds all other types of separation techniques.
A mass spectrometer (MS) functions as a detector for
this instrument type. The GC introduces the molecules
into the MS one at a time in small narrow bands called
“peaks.” These narrow bands of molecules are then
ionized by the ion source of the mass spectrometer and
pushed out of the source using an electric field. Ionic

does not store. All of these compounds require time to
travel the length of the GC column and be purged from
the instrument before the next sample can be analyzed.
When a GC/MS method is developed, caution is taken
that interfering compounds are not found in specimens.
However, new drugs or special foods may introduce
previously unseen compounds that exit the GC together
with one of the analytes, causing false elevations.
Typical run time: 15 to 45 minutes per sample;
tests looking for a small number of compounds can
sometimes be run faster. Profiles of large numbers of
compounds typically take 25 to 45 minutes for all of the
compounds to be fully resolved by the GC.

Theory: ICP/MS is a technique for the simultaneous measurement of multiple chemical elements such
as calcium, copper, and chromium. The instrument
consists of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) device as a source for a mass spectrometer. The heart of
these instruments is the plasma—a state of matter not
normally encountered on the earth. A powerful electromagnetic field oscillating at a specific frequency is
generated to cause extreme excitation of the argon that
is flowing as a carrier of the specimen. The temperature at the center of the oscillating field rises to many
thousands of degrees Kelvin, so that all organic matter
is immediately destroyed and the chemical elements are
almost completely ionized. Otherwise, the idea behind
the instrument is simple; you pump a liquid sample into
a sample introduction system that sprays the liquid into
the plasma. The mass spectrometer then simultaneously
measures the amount of each element by counting ions
of specific mass-to-charge ratio.
Uses: An ICP/MS can be used for the fast and accurate measurement of toxic metals in any sample matrix
that can be dissolved and introduced into the instrument
as a liquid. The instrument can also measure all of the
essential elements. For example, chromium, zinc, cobalt,
and selenium can easily be measured by ICP/MS under
various conditions in many different sample types, such
as blood, urine, waste water, soil, and tissue digestions.
Advantages: ICP/MS is a very fast technique for the
measurement of many different elements. It is also very
sensitive, so measuring very low levels of some elements
is easily accomplished.
Disadvantages: Interferences at specific masses is
the greatest disadvantage of using this technique. Many



## ICP/MS

fragments are then separated by their mass-to-charge
ratio using an electric field or a magnetic field, depending on the type of instrument. Each compound generates
a unique fragmentation pattern, and the mass spectrometer allows the analyst to “fingerprint” each compound
for measurement and positive identification.
Uses: A GC/MS is used for the analysis of volatile
compounds. Mixtures of long-chain fatty acid methyl
esters with components that vary only by the positions
of their double bonds can be fully separated by GC
and measured with high sensitivity by the MS detector.
Mixtures of industrial waste containing organic solvents
and small organic compounds are analyzed by GC/MS
analysis. Other uses range from positive identification
for drugs of abuse to environmental monitoring and
quick, positive identification of chemical weapons of
mass destruction.
Advantages: A GC/MS has the greatest ability to
resolve molecules of similar chemical and physical
properties. The mass spectrometer is a universal detector
that can detect any type of compound, and the fragment
analysis allows the analyst to make positive identifications of compounds of interest as long as a pure standard is available for comparison.
Disadvantages: The biggest disadvantage of using a
GC/MS is that the compounds being measured must be
volatile in order for them to enter the GC. Compounds
such as amino acids and most organic acids in human
tissues decompose before they boil, so they cannot be
directly analyzed. They may be made volatile by carrying the specimen through multiple steps of chemical
reactions. This process introduces uncertainty into the
analysis because operator error increases with the number
of complex steps required. The reactions must be nearly
100% efficient and must be very reproducible. The chemical reactions change the fingerprint of the compound
so that it may no longer have a unique fingerprint. Care
must be taken to choose the appropriate mass values for
measurement, as multiple mass spectral interferences can
cause problems when reporting quantitative values.
The amount of time needed to run a sample
through the instrument is also a problem when analyzing a complex sample mixture, because the instrument needs time to separate and measure all of the
compounds of interest, as well as purge all of the other
materials introduced with the sample. Biological samples
contain hundreds of different compounds, drugs, metabolic waste products, and excess nutrients that the body

DRC ICP/MS
A DRC ICP/MS is a new type of instrument that
helps eliminate the problem of high-energy polyatomic
interferences. The gas flow system contains a separate
compartment called a dynamic reaction cell (DRC). The
cell is filled with a controlled amount of an inert gas
such as argon or methane. As the polyatomic ions enter
this chamber, they collide with the atoms of inert gas,
causing fragmentation. The masses of the fragmented
polyatomic ions no longer match the masses of the elements of interest. For example, argon carbide (ArC) is
a polyatomic ion that interferes with the measurement
of chromium. They both share mass 52 and cannot be
distinguished using normal bench-top mass spectrometers. Inside the collision cell, ArC collides with methane
and is fragmented into Ar and C. Argon’s mass is 40, and
carbon’s mass is 12, so Cr 52 can be measured at much
lower levels.

interfering compounds. Many different types of separation technology exist, including ion exchange, phenyl
character, chiral-specific, normal, and reverse-phase
separation technology. Each has its benefits for specific
separations. The MS/MS detector for these instruments
is sometimes called a triple quad mass spectrometer
because it actually contains three mass spectrometers in
series. A tandem mass spectrometer contains two mass
filters (called quadrupoles) with a collision cell between
them. An ionized compound is directed by the first filter
into the collision cell where it is fragmented by collision with an inert gas, usually argon. The fragmentation
pattern is unique for each type of compound. The final
mass spectrometer directs a chosen identifying ion to
the detector. In practice, there are many factors, such as
molecular interferences, peak shapes, and detector dwell
times, to consider.
Solvents that fully volatilize in the sample
introduction chamber may be introduced into the
MS/MS detector and only those solvents may be used
for HPLC method development. This consideration
will heavily limit development because there are very
limited choices for volatile solvent/buffer combinations
to move the compounds through the chromatographic
column. This restriction is due to the requirement for
total removal of the solvent before the target compounds
move into the detector.
The liquid stream that exits the chromatograph is
nebulized into tiny droplets that become charged as they
begin to evaporate in the high temperature and vacuum
of the MS/MS introduction chamber. As the droplets
become smaller, the charge on each droplet becomes
larger, eventually causing the droplet to disintegrate. The
charge is transferred to the compounds dissolved as they
become part of the gas phase. The very high vacuum
inside the MS/MS draws the ions through the sampling
cone where they are routed through the instrument
using electric fields.

of the elements of interest in a biological sample cannot
be measured with great accuracy because of high-energy
byproducts generated by the plasma. Adducts of the carrier gas, argon, cause the most problems. These interferences can cause some elements to appear artificially high
owing to the huge amount of argon used in the ionization process through the plasma.
Typical run time: Once the specimen is prepared
by proper dilutions and insertions of internal standards,
instrument run times of 3 to 10 minutes are common,
depending on the number of elements being measured
and their relative amounts in the sample. Low-level analysis takes longer because the MS requires longer reading
times. Rinse times between samples also add up to
5 minutes per sample, depending on the type of sample
being analyzed and the time needed to completely purge
the sample introduction system between samples.

## LC/MS/MS
Theory: Liquid chromatography with tandem
mass spectrometric detection (LC/MS/MS) is a relatively
new technology that is just now entering wide use in
clinical labs. The instrument consists of a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, or simply LC)
coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). The
LC separates molecules based on their various physical
properties. Method developers must choose the correct
separation technology and use it correctly to gain the
best separation possible for the desired compounds and

Notes:



## HPLC: FLD, DAD

Theory: High performance liquid chromatography
is the oldest and most common separation and detection
technology. The instrumentation consists of an HPLC
coupled to a fluorescence detector (FLD) or diode array
detector (DAD). This instrumentation has been in routine use for several decades and is well characterized in
hundreds of published applications.
The liquid chromatographic systems operate at high
pressures generated by pumps. Specimens are injected
onto a column filled with silica beads with coatings chosen to match the chemical properties of the compounds
being analyzed. The beads are called the stationary
phase. The solvent or mobile phase consists of water
with various salts and organic solvents. Compounds
in the specimen adhere to the coating as they migrate
down the length of the column.
Compounds with lower affinity for the coating
reach the detector first. As the effluent stream passes
through a chamber illuminated by an intense light
source, the detector measures light that is emitted (FLD)
or absorbed (DAD) by the compounds. The DAD is the
most versatile detector of the two because it is able to
simultaneously measure multiple wavelengths in the
ultraviolet and visible spectrum. For FLD detection,
compounds may need to be chemically modified with a
fluorescent “tag.” The instrument then detects the presence of this tag.
Uses: Any compound that can be dissolved in a
solvent that does not destroy the system can probably
be measured by HPLC with a properly chosen detector
system. In addition to clinical laboratories, applications
for this highly proven and mature technology are found
in food processing, drug analysis, fine chemicals, refining, industrial purification, and quality-control processes
in manufacturing.
Advantages: Simplicity and easy maintenance are
the greatest advantages. These qualities must be ascribed
to innumerable refinements by instrument manufacturers. Method development is relatively inexpensive.
Disadvantages: Many applications are too slow for
high-volume clinical laboratories. Analytical limitations
include lack of sensitivity or detection for some types of
compounds that neither absorb nor fluoresce in the visible or near UV spectrum. Robust and reliable method
development requires a scientist who is well versed in
the science (and art) of chromatography. Typical run
time is ten minutes to 2 hours or more.

Further filtering of unwanted solvent is performed
in the first quadrupole stage. It’s at this point that the
tandem mass spectrometer differs greatly from the mass
spectrometer of the GC/MS and ICP/MS. In the tandem
mass spectrometer, the first mass spectrometer removes
interfering solvent molecules and generates parent ions
of compounds of interest, and the second one fragments
the parent ions into daughter ions that are directed to
the photomultiplier. The tandem selection of parent
and daughter ions allows great confidence regarding
the identities of the compounds being measured. The
tandem mass spectrometer has the ability to rapidly and
accurately measure a single compound in the presence
of many others. Because of the speed of electronic tuning of the mass spectrometers, the tandem mass spectrometer allows measurement of multiple compounds
that may be present in each peak that may emerge in the
LC liquid stream.
Uses: LC/MS/MS instruments have many uses.
They allow for the accurate measurement of very small
amounts of specific compounds in the presence of large
concentrations of contaminants. They are routinely used
in clinical laboratories for screening of inborn errors of
metabolism and therapeutic drug monitoring. They are
applied for detection of macromolecules and biological
screening for discovery of new drugs.
Advantages: The shorter run times offer the largest
advantage over other analytical methods for multiple
compound analyses. The transfer of compound-resolving power to the electronic speeds of the mass spectrometer allows for quick measurement of multiple compounds with great accuracy and reliability.
Disadvantages: Like all mass spectrometers the
LC/MS/MS can also suffer from mass spectral interference. Even with the great specificity of the MS/MS,
isomers may be present in physiological specimens that
fragment in the same manner as compounds of interest.
Such interfering compounds must be separated chromatographically to ensure accurate results.
Typical run time: A specimen may be analyzed in
2 to 15 minutes, depending on the number of interferences for each analyte, as well as the number of isomers
being measured that must be separated chromatographically. A typical run time for a small number of analytes
with no interfering contaminants is less than 5 minutes.

## Reliability of Test Results
A clinically useful test must provide reliable information that would not normally be derived from symptoms
alone. Reliability means that a test must be adequately
sensitive and highly reproducible. In the field of clinical
chemistry, reliability is assessed in a number of ways.
For a test to be reliable, not only must it be reproducible over time, it must also vary with real change in
the individual, either owing to treatment or some other
factor, not just random variation of the assay. Reliability
of a test is determined by both analytical and nonanalytical factors.

Non-Analytical Factors

Accuracy — A test is accurate if it reflects the true
value or detects the presence of the substance being
measured. In analytical runs of multiple specimens,
quality control (QC) samples of known values are
included to check for the accuracy of the run. These results can then be charted to give a history of the assay to
show if the accuracy is drifting or shifting. These charts
allow the technologists to assess the accuracy of a test
used in daily production. Proficiency testing programs
that are discussed later in this chapter provide independent, external monitoring of accuracy.

Analytical Factors: Accuracy,
Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity

with high sensitivity correctly identifies a high percentage of patients who actually have a particular condition.
A test with low sensitivity will produce a large number
of false negatives, and it will miss many individuals who
actually have the condition.
A test with high specificity correctly identifies a
high percentage of subjects who do not have a particular condition. A test with poor specificity will have a
high degree of false positives. It will inaccurately denote
many individuals as having a condition when in reality
they do not. It is easy to see that problems with accuracy
and precision of the test can also affect the sensitivity
and specificity of the test.
Laboratories must provide data demonstrating a
test’s accuracy and precision to licensing agencies when
they are inspected. More detail on the inspection process
is given later in this chapter. Many other analytical
issues such as purity and consistency of reagents and
matrix matching for biological specimens are checked
because they can be critical for maintaining high quality
standards.26

Precision — Precision refers to the measure of variance of the assay. Imagine a target in a shooting range.
If all of the hits form a tight cluster on the target, the
shooter is very precise. If the hits cluster around the
center, the shooter is also very accurate. Similarly, a test
that is run on the same sample many times should yield
results that are clustered in a small range. The variability
around the number is calculated as the coefficient of
variation, or CV, for that test. Typically, CVs should be
no higher than 10 to 20% for high-complexity tests. A
test can have a high degree of precision, yet be highly
inaccurate. So accuracy and precision go hand in hand
in determining a good laboratory test.
Sensitivity and Specificity — These terms refer
to a diagnostic test’s ability to reliably predict whether
a person does or does not have a particular disease.
Expressed mathematically, these values are expressions
of the test’s false-positive and false-negative rates. A test

Factors that do not involve analytical sensitivity
and accuracy may be classified as pre-analytical factors
and issues of biological variation. Pre-analytical factors
are actions that can affect results before the sample is
analyzed. These include variations in patient preparation
(e.g., fasting vs. non-fasting), sample collection, sample
temperature and exposure to light during transport, and
equipment maintenance. A special patient-preparation
issue concerns challenge testing where the nature and
timing of the challenge may be critical. To determine
whether a specimen is acceptable when it is received at
the laboratory, stability studies should be run under various storage conditions.
Physiological variation is an important factor to
understand when considering metabolic tests. If a test
is to be used to design therapeutic regimens for patients
and monitor progress, then the test must have general
physiological stability over appropriate time spans, and
a result must change because of an intervention rather
than random physiological variation. This characteristic is widely appreciated in traditional blood chemistry
measures. Serum cholesterol, for example, has fairly
good physiological stability from day to day unless there
is a significant change owing to drug usage or acute
pathological issues.

Reference Intervals

In the field of clinical chemistry, a reference interval
is designed to allow the clinician to make a decision
regarding the patient’s level of health. Traditionally, the
test result would indicate either the presence or absence of a disease regarding its own accuracy, precision,
sensitivity, and specificity issues, which were discussed
earlier. In integrative and functional medicine, this
becomes a more difficult decision to make, since many
of the chronic illnesses treated in this type of medicine
are not clearly defined diseases, for reasons previously
discussed. Rather, the analysis of nutrient and metabolic
compounds indicates levels of insufficiency or imbalance
that can relate to health issues.
Typically, an analyte in clinical chemistry is referenced by looking at population distributions of the test
result, preferably in healthy individuals. For tests developed within a laboratory, the lab will usually draw from
its database of tests that it has run over a period of time.
The normal range for this group of test results is defined
as that population within two standard deviations of the
mean. In a normally distributed population, this would
be 95% of the population, or the 95% reference or confidence interval. By definition, therefore, 5% of people
tested would be abnormal.
Clearly, this is not the most useful way of evaluating whether a person may have marginal nutritional
deficiencies. Take the example of magnesium: A recent
government study showed 68% of Americans consumed
less than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for
magnesium, and 19% consumed less than 50% of the
RDA.23 This would indicate that a large percentage of
Americans are magnesium deficient. What, then, would
be a useful reference interval for a clinician who wants
to determine if their patient is magnesium deficient?
Certainly, the typical two standard deviations from the
mean would be relatively useless, since far more than
5% of the population should be magnesium insufficient.

## 95% Reference Interval

of cardiovascular disease. By dividing the populations
tested into quintile ranks, researchers were able to correlate risk of cardiovascular events with these rankings.24
Those individuals falling in the highest or fifth quintile
demonstrated significantly higher risk of cardiovascular
events than those in the lowest quintile. In this way, hsCRP has been shown to be a strong predictor of risk.
A similar approach can be taken with other analytes,
whether nutrients, metabolites, or toxic compounds. By
arranging the test data by quintile, the clinician can easily determine where a patient falls relative to a population from which the reference data were obtained. This
allows the clinician to more easily assess the significance
of the finding, particularly as he gains experience using
the test with patients.
Most of the case illustrations in this book are taken
from the actual laboratory reports where a combination of charts that show quintile positions and 95%
percentile reference limits used to aid the interpretation
of results. Figure 1.3 shows the display of results from a
report on serum vitamins.

## Quintile Ranking
A more reasonable approach is percentile ranking of
the result. This has been particularly useful in assessing
the measures of risk factors for certain disease states.
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measures
have been developed in this way to relate levels to risk
## Quality Assurance
Advances in the medical sciences over the past
50 years have caused an exponential growth in numbers
and types of laboratory tests and clinical laboratories. As
in any production environment, concerns over quality
of the clinical laboratory’s product—test results—have
been a driving force behind increased regulation and
continual improvement in quality management systems
(QMS). These include comprehensive policies, processes, and procedures to assure that all the various components affecting test results are designed, implemented,
and monitored to assure highest quality.
Although laboratories are continually monitoring
quality internally, external monitoring through a formalized process known as a laboratory inspection is also
important. Every clinical laboratory in the United States
is required by law to have a quality assurance program
that is monitored by some accredited, unbiased, external
agency. This includes an onsite inspection by an external
agency that can take several days. During these visits,
inspectors examine various aspects of the laboratory
operation, as outlined below.

occupies a significant portion of the inspection process.
The inspectors will then observe and talk with the laboratory staff to verify the procedures are being followed as
set forth in the SOPM. The procedure manual describes
the following:

Since it is impossible for inspectors to directly view
all the details of a laboratory’s operation, they want to
ascertain that the laboratory has clear, planned, and
systematic policies and procedures for each component.
They also check to see that these policies and procedures
are, in fact, being followed by the laboratory personnel.
A typical QMS quality assurance program describes how
the laboratory:

Quality Assurance Program

• monitors and evaluates the overall quality of
testing and other laboratory procedures;
• assures accurate, reliable, and prompt
reporting of test results;

• Test principle
• Clinical significance of the test
• Specimen requirements
• Required reagents
• Details of the test calibration
• Required quality control material

• assures the competency of their
staff to perform their tasks;

• Assay procedural steps

• identifies and resolves problems; and

• Reference intervals

• monitors proficiency testing and other
quality control data to substantiate that
all tests conform to the laboratory’s
specified performance criteria.

• Interpretation of test results

Standard Operating
Procedure Manual (SOPM)
The SOPM describes the methods, materials,
and other information necessary to perform all the
tests offered by the laboratory. Review of this document

• Result calculations

Personnel Records
Inspectors will check to make sure the laboratory
personnel performing the test procedures have the appropriate training, experience, educational background, continuing education, and responsibilities. The appropriate
documentation on each laboratory employee performing
tests must be kept in the employee’s personnel records.

Quality Control Data

and each is spiked with a different, known amount of the
analyte to be measured. The specimens are analyzed and
the results are compared to see if the method is yielding
the known difference amongst the samples.

Quality control is a set of procedures designed to
ensure that the test results regularly produced by the
clinical laboratory are sufficiently reliable for use by the
clinician. Each time laboratory technologists run an assay, they include a quality control sample that produces
results that must fall within the laboratory’s criteria of
precision and accuracy. The inspectors review whether
the laboratory has been running a sufficient number of
QC samples and monitoring their results in a manner
that can assure accuracy of results for patient specimens.

## Workflow Assessment
Weaknesses in a quality assurance program can
be determined by performing a workflow assessment,
where a single specimen and test order are monitored
from the beginning (pre-analytic) to the end (postanalytic) of the entire process. The assessment may be
divided into the following three segments:

## Proficiency Testing

1. Pre-analytic (Was the specimen collected, shipped,
received, and processed properly, and was the test
order entered into the computer system correctly?)

2. Analytic (Was the test performed according
to procedures, was the instrument
functioning properly, and were the
results reviewed before reporting?)
3. Post-analytic (Were the results reported and
archived appropriately, and was the specimen
stored properly for potential retest if necessary?)

Proficiency testing refers to a program of external
quality assessment designed to check the accuracy of a
test by comparing it with a known concentration in a
sample. The sample is provided by a certified external
agency and is shipped to all the laboratories participating
in the survey. Each laboratory analyzes the sample using
its instrumentation and methodology and reports its results back to the agency. The agency compiles the results
from all the laboratories and sends an analysis of the results back to the laboratories. Historically, these programs
developed from the clinical chemistry industry’s need for
determining test accuracy to allow interlaboratory comparisons. Initially, programs were developed using what
were called “Olympian Labs.” These were organizations
whose quality was considered to be beyond question,
and if they produced a test result, it must be correct.
A system was set up to compare all other labs with the
Olympian ones. Unfortunately, this approach did not last
long, as it was quickly discovered that even the Olympians can make mistakes. It has become much more useful
to define the “correct result” by consensus. All results are
pooled and the deviation from the collective mean determines the individual laboratory’s accuracy.
Proficiency reports may also require laboratory
directors to correctly identify diseases indicated by the
results, thus testing all aspects, including diagnosis of
pathology. Proficiency testing programs have contributed
greatly to the improved accuracy in laboratory testing.
However, because of the expense of developing proficiency samples and administering the process, these programs
are available only for tests that are commonly performed.
If proficiency testing is not available, other methods may
be used to check accuracy, such as split-sample comparison with other laboratories. Spiked recovery studies are
also used, wherein a specimen is split into several parts
Licensing and
Certification
Monitoring by External Agencies
Federal: In response to public furor about one or
more deaths attributed to false-negative Pap smear readings, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) in 1988, which expanded
earlier regulations to include all laboratories, regardless
of size or location (including physician office laboratories), that test human specimens collected in the United
States and its territories. This means that all clinical laboratories, except for those that perform only waived tests
(such as urine dipstick), are inspected for compliance
with CLIA regulations by the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) or another agency recognized
by CMS as having standards equal to or more rigorous
than its own.
State: States have their own licensing agencies,
and some of these require out-of-state laboratories to be
licensed in their states.

Voluntary: There are also voluntary accrediting
agencies, such as the College of American Pathologists
(CAP); COLA; and the Joint Commission of Healthcare
Organizations (JCAHO). Although these agencies were
originally created to serve different types of clinical laboratories, today they share similar scopes and objectives.
The International Standardization Organization
(ISO) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) have issued standards and guidelines for clinical
laboratories. These are used by licensing and accrediting agencies as they write their own guidelines, and by
clinical laboratories as they develop their own operating
procedures and quality assurance programs.
Standards and guidelines are readily available
free or for purchase on the Internet. Free guidelines
are available through CLIA, CAP, and CLEP Web sites.
Others are more restricted and require membership
(COLA, JCAHO). CLSI and ISO standards can be
purchased through their Web sites:

• are widely accepted in the medical community
as having relevance to patient care.

Many of the tests offered in the integrative and functional medicine market are innovative and not widely
offered in conventional medicine. Many of the newer
tests do not use FDA-approved kits or have external
proficiency testing programs available. They may not be
widely accepted in the medical community as having
relevance to patient care. However, the testing that currently meets the criteria for accreditation began in the
innovative laboratory. The accrediting agencies realize
the contribution innovative tests make to medicine, and
they are working to find ways to assist these laboratories
with their quality assurance programs, while not incurring excessive burden and liability.
Since biochemical imbalances created by nutritional
insufficiencies precede clinical signs and symptoms,
laboratory testing can provide early warnings of nutrient-related clinical problems. By its nature, the assignment of sensitivity and specificity values for this type
of testing is very difficult, since there are no established
ways to identify true positives and true negatives. Nutrition affects multiple metabolic processes, and laboratory
evaluation of nutritional status can take many forms.
The chapters that follow provide the clinician with
insight regarding the scientific basis of tools to evaluate patient metabolic issues and to assist in developing
safe, cost-effective, and reliable treatments for restoring
normal function.

• CLEP: www.wadsworth.org

• JCAHO: www.jcaho.org

• have external proficiency testing programs, and

• CAP: www.cap.org

• COLA: www.cola.org

• use FDA-approved kits and/or instrumentation,

• CLIA/CMS: www.cms.hhs.gov

substantially simpler and reduces liability for the
accrediting institution. Their “area of expertise” includes
tests that:

Certification by any agency does not ensure that
laboratory errors will not occur. For example, errors
were detected at a CAP-accredited laboratory, resulting
in a potential for releasing several hundred inaccurate
HIV results. CAP quickly responded by making significant alterations in its inspection program to improve
its own quality assurance. It now uses unannounced
inspections and is improving its training of inspectors.
Each agency responds to such quality issues by improving its own standards for monitoring.
Some voluntary accrediting agencies will accredit
laboratories only where a significant percentage of the
test menu falls within the agency’s area of expertise.
This makes the inspection and accreditation process
