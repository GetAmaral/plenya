Pattern Analyis

Since essential nutrients are indispensable for the
function of all cells and tissues, the symptoms and signs
resulting from deficiencies of various nutrients exhibit
a high degree of overlap. For example, conditions such
as malaise, depression, or diarrhea can be affected by
deficiencies of thiamin, methionine, or zinc. Thus, it
is generally difficult to know which nutrient groups to
evaluate based on initial clinical observations.
The ideal evaluation would provide information on
the status of all 40 essential and conditionally essential
nutrients, plus factors that modulate nutrient needs.
Interventions could then be designed to support all areas
of insufficiency necessary for optimizing energy metabolism, detoxification, redox status and other tissue functions. To approximate this ideal, a testing profile should
provide sufficient data to allow reasonable assurance
that areas of clinical focus can be identified. Numerous
laboratory reports containing the measured parameters

must be reviewed and evaluated. The evaluation of dozens of interacting parameters can be daunting and time
consuming. Most clinicians surmount these obstacles by
stepwise integration of single test results or profiles and
use of the expertise of colleagues and laboratory experts
to guide their acquisition of the expertise needed for
making decisions in each case. Multi-test profiles that
are widely performed are summarized in Table 12.1.
Stepwise integration should begin with the single
profile that yields the most comprehensive and useful
insight into critical nutrient needs. The enzyme stimulation assays discussed in Chapter 2 provide information
about a single vitamin, while profiles of amino acid or
organic acids yield data for multiple nutrients. Based on
patient history and clinical assessment, one of the multiple analyte profiles is typically selected first. Other tests
may be added to expand the range of nutrients initially
evaluated or as follow-up testing to confirm or elaborate
abnormalities found in an initial routine evaluation.
A common approach is to order the profile of organic
acids in urine as a sensitive, broad-range test that can

expert reliance is the computation of relative risk from
cholesterol data. More recent and detailed algorithms
may be used to make recommendations of individually
customized essential amino acids or full vitamin-mineral
formulas. Such computer-generated recommendations
are always subject to the attending physician’s final revision based on the patient’s medical history and physical
exam. Nutrient recommendations based on integration of multiple profiles are derived from knowledge of
how the patterns of various direct measurements and
functional markers determine the focal nutrient needs
for each patient.

Multiple Markers

The clinical relevance of laboratory data includes
pathognomonic abnormalities (factors that define the
presence of a disease) and risk factors that suggest the
likelihood for future disease. For example, the finding of
elevated fasting glucose defines the presence of diabetes,
while the finding of elevated total cholesterol indicates
increased risk of heart disease. Both of these tests are
performed routinely because they have demonstrated
value in improving patient outcomes. Their usefulness, however, is greatly enhanced when other related
parameters are measured. Examples of tests that help to
define the nature of some primary evaluations are shown
in Table 12.2.
Assessments of nutritional and toxicant status
likewise are strengthened by reinforcing tests. Multiple
web-like interactions between the effects of nutrients,
toxicants and metabolic regulators generate the total picture of how focal issues impact patient outcomes. Thus,
the impact of dietary iron deficiency is made worse by
simultaneous hypochlorhydria, low vitamin C intake
and toxic element exposures. Simultaneous determination of markers that reveal status of the related factors allows better prediction of responses to iron supplementation. In the previous chapters many references to related
factors have been made in the discussions of individual
nutrients, toxicants and cell regulators. Because of the
number of factors and their interactions, the combinations that generate individual patient patterns are, for
all practical purposes, endless. The general approach to
multiple profile integration will be introduced in this
chapter by considering related parameters in a specific
example case.

help guide specific clinical interventions. The evaluation
may then be expanded with specific antioxidant marker
analysis or fatty acid profiling. Elemental or amino acid
profiling can enhance confidence of having identified
focal issues that become reference points for monitoring
the success of interventions.
Another rational approach is to deal with issues
that may have overriding impact on nutrient supplementation before focusing on other specific nutrient
deficiencies. For patients with primary presentations of
depression, anxiety or chronic fatigue, a plasma amino
acid profile serves to guide amino acid interventions that
directly influence neurotransmitter turnover. System
function approaches frequently focus on GI function,
hormonal and neurotransmitter functions or immune
competence. Digestive and microbial stool testing,
food-specific serum IgG levels, and other measures
of digestive function can guide diet-specific alterations and enhance digestive tolerance. Specific nutrient
deficiencies that may be present can be made worse by
food restrictions. For example, food sensitivity testing
frequently leads to elimination of several classes of high
protein foods. The low intake of high protein foods can
exacerbate amino acid deficiencies. Without adequate
amino acids, restoration of gut immune barrier integrity can be difficult. This type of circular dependency
is best dealt with by simultaneous evaluations of food
sensitivities, amino acid status and degree of intestinal
microbial overgrowth. Thus, the integration of data
from multiple profiles provides a much more complete
picture of areas of most critical need.
As the complexity of laboratory data increases, interpreting results to arrive at a clinical solution becomes
more difficult. However, experts in nutritional science,
clinical therapies and the implications of abnormal
laboratory results have developed algorithms to assist in
the interpretation. The most common example of such

within a Single Profile

Ms. B was described as a very bright workaholic
who presented with a sense of brain fog, which had dramatically increased in recent weeks. She also reported
greater difficulty with mood swings around her menstruation with severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal
thoughts. She had chronic fatigue for two or three years.
An overnight urine sample was sent for quantitative
organic acid profiling. The results reveal corroborating evidence of underlying metabolic difficulty. The
results are divided into 4 sets of analytes for discussion
(Tables 12.3 to 12.6).

## Energy Pathway Intermediates
In the first set, two features relate to nutrient
requirements (Table 12.3). Elevated citrate and isocitrate are markers for arginine insufficiency (urea cycle
inadequacy for ammonia clearance) and elevated malate and pyruvate are found in deficiencies of CoQ10
(Chapter 6, “Organic Acids”). This data suggests that

arginine and CoQ10 supplementation can be helpful. Deficiency of the B-complex vitamins can also lead to elevated citrate, but there are usually multiple citric acid cycle
intermediates elevated in such cases. In addition, there are
other markers for the B-vitamins discussed below.

## B-Vitamin Markers
The compounds shown in Table 12.4 are elevated in specific nutrient deficiencies as discussed in
Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” Thiamin is the key nutrient
required to clear the α-keto-acids. Methylmalonate is a
specific marker for vitamin B12 inadequacy and hydroxymethylglutarate is the compound from which coenzyme
Q10 is synthesized in the liver. Finding levels of hydroxymethylglutarate that are so low they can not be detected
corroborates our conclusion from the first set regarding
a relative coenzyme Q10 deficit and further suggests that
mitochondrial inefficiency may be contributing to the
brain fog reported by the patient.
Detoxification Markers
Abnormally high values for three other compounds
indicate that Ms. B is having difficulty with her elimination of toxic compounds (Table 12.5). Elevated orotate
is a sensitive marker for arginine deficiency. Orotate is

the product of an alternate pathway for clearing ammonia when the urea cycle is inefficient, and chronic
sub-clinical ammonia exposure is a possibility. The
decision to supplement with arginine because of high
citrate is greatly strengthened. In addition, the clearance
of orotate is a magnesium-dependent process, so there is
evidence of need for this commonly deficient mineral.
A separate issue is raised by the rest of the pattern found in the third set. Glutathione and inorganic
sulfate are critical for hepatic detoxification. Sulfate is
the excretory form of sulfur from most sulfur-containing
compounds in the body. Since glutathione makes up a
major fraction of total body sulfur due to the presence of
cysteine in its structure, it follows that depletion of glutathione lowers urinary sulfate. Pyroglutamate elevation
signals loss of glutathione in the amino acid recovery
pathway in the kidney (see Chapter 6, “Organic Acids”),
which contributes to depletion of the total body glutathione pool. In this case, the sulfate is very low and the
pyroglutamate is elevated. These two markers together
strongly indicate glutathione depletion and gives extra
cause for concern over the issue of detoxification capacity that may lead to endotoxemia. Since we now have
evidence of impaired detoxification capacity, the question of toxin loads becomes more important. Indications
of one significant source of toxins, intestinal microbial
overgrowth, in this case are found in the bacterial overgrowth marker organic acids shown in Table 12.6.

The three compounds shown in shown in Table 12.6
are some of the metabolic markers of intestinal dysbiosis, all of which were within normal ranges in this case,
except for tricarballylate. Growth of the bacteria that produce tricarballylate is favored by consuming diets high in
carbohydrate, especially following treatments with widespectrum antibiotics. The compound does not seem to be
highly toxic, but it avidly binds to magnesium, preventing absorption of the mineral. Animals with tricarballylic
aciduria develop magnesium deficiency. Although the
condition has been little investigated in humans, the finding of such greatly abnormal concentrations in this case
adds to the suspicion of magnesium deficiency. Thus, we
find additive signs pointing to magnesium inadequacy
with high tricarballylate and the orotate accumulation
noted above. If other microbial metabolites had been elevated in Ms. B’s urine, concern about toxic loading from
intestinal dysbiosis would have been greatly increased.

Pattern Analyis
Although less than half of the markers from the
organic acid profile have been reviewed at this point,
the significant strengthening of conclusions by inspecting for patterns of related markers should be clear. One
rule of thumb regarding efficient reading of complex
marker profiles is to resist making final decisions about
intervention focus until the entire set of analytes has
been studied. Abnormalities found on the final page

can easily shift the focus regarding the focal area most
likely to be the current critical point needing aggressive support. Some patterns of organic acids and amino
acids frequently found in specific conditions are shown
in Tables 12.7 and 12.8. Most patients with complex
degenerative disorders show various degrees of severity
in multiple categories.

and other metabolic controls requires the chain of
nutrients that serve as co-catalysts, antioxidants, and
detoxification substrates. While the primary purpose of
the profiles included in this case is evaluation of nutrient
status, the nature of the analysis, especially in the case
of organic acids in urine, affords insight into nutrient-related detoxification and digestive factors as well.

The Power of Simultaneous
Multiple Profiles
We can proceed to investigate the metabolic basis
of Ms. B’s brain fog, fatigue, and suicidal tendencies
because the profile of organic acids in urine was not the
only one that was performed. The other profiles will be
discussed as an illustration of how the results can shed
light on her metabolic status and allow us to determine
the most critical areas of nutrient demand in this phase
of Ms. B’s life. The profiles do not include hormone,
food allergy, or other immune system evaluations. Additional digestive system and detoxification assessments
could also provide valuable insight. Simultaneous evaluation of multiple parameters can identify focal issues
where aggressive correction frequently yields restoration
of health. This way of approaching patient evaluations
stems from an awareness that formation of hormones

Serum Vitamins and

The array of markers for functional vitamin adequacy in the organic acid profile covers most vitamins
except the fat-soluble group. A separate profile of fatsoluble antioxidant vitamins extracted from serum was
performed on Ms. B (Table 12.9).
Here is evidence from an independent assay that
supports the previous assessment of functional CoQ10

role, CoQ10 performs a general membrane antioxidant
function in concert with the other antioxidants in this
profile. We see that β-carotene is undetectable and,
although vitamins E and A are not below their respective
limits, the levels are just over the stated lower limits.
The pattern of inadequate antioxidant protection found
here leads us to suspect that the rate of oxidant damage to tissue components is too high. The suspicion is
confirmed by finding elevated levels of lipid peroxides
in serum (Table 12.10). With these results, we have a
point of reference for the current rate of oxidative damage against which future testing may be compared. Any
interventions that improve antioxidant capacity should
cause a lowering of the serum lipid peroxide level.
Lipid peroxide levels are found elevated in some cases
even though the fat-soluble antioxidant vitamins are all
normal. In such cases, the next most likely area of insufficiency is that of trace elements.

Elemental status assessment was performed by
measuring concentrations in erythrocytes (Table 12.11).
Functional deficiency of magnesium was suggested by
the first set of organic acids discussed above, and there
is an additional functional deficiency of zinc revealed
below under fatty acids (Table 12.12) . An independent assay of circulating levels of these elements in
erythrocytes (shown above) gives significant weight to
conclusions about deficiencies indicated by metabolic
blocks. The important findings of low circulating levels
of essential nutrients help to identify nutrient deficiency.
Erythrocyte magnesium of 25 ppm is enough to explain
the molecular basis of symptoms of mood swings and
depression in this patient. Look closely here to see how
many trace elements are near the low limit. We find
that, in addition to low levels of selenium and zinc,
chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium are within 10%
of their low limits, indicating a potential problem with
trace element absorption and assimilation. Low stomach
acid output is the most frequently occurring factor that
leads to general trace element malabsorption.

## Elemental Status

Fatty Acid Status
Pertinent features of the fatty acid profile are shown
in Table 12.12. The pattern displays the frequently

seed oil is recommended. Note the relationship of the

amino acid replacement. Another reason to initiate free
form amino acid support is that supplemental vitamins,
elements and essential fatty acids can easily cause a fall
of fasting essential amino acids due to stimulation of
utilization for protein synthesis or detoxification.
This case presents an example of the integration
of data from amino acid and organic acid profiles to
establish a plan of metabolic management. When multiple indicators of functional amino acid inadequacies
are present, a combination amino acid supplementation formula could be useful for restoration of optimal
nutritional status although most amino acids in plasma
were in the “normal” range. Such interventions to restore
optimal function rather than simply assure normal concentrations are a common theme in nutritional medicine. The clinician is challenged to use laboratory limits
in new ways because nutrient concentration values that
are normal may still be inadequate under the conditions
of other nutrient therapy.
The frequently observed patterns found in this case
cover all essential nutrient categories and illustrate the
general concept of strengthening conclusions based on
clinical laboratory data by using multiple markers within
and between different metabolic profiles. The varieties of patterns for abnormal results are endless, but the
experienced practitioner develops a keen sense of where
to look for reinforcing results.

linolenic acid (C18:3). The former is converted to the
latter by the action of the zinc-dependent enzyme, delta6-desaturase (see Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids”). Failure of
adequate conversion is frequently due to zinc deficiency
and results in such a pattern of normal linoleic with
low gamma linolenic. The pattern is strengthened by
simultaneously finding low dihomogamma linoleic acid
(DGLA). This is the pattern mentioned in the “Elemental Status” section above. Long chain PUFAs need to be
supplied as fish and black currant oils while correcting
the zinc deficiency in such cases. The adequate EPA and
DHA levels found in the current case, however, mean
that a balance of flax and fish oils is the best choice to
restore fatty acid balance.
Since we know that aggressive supplementation of
polyunsaturated fatty acids tends to increase the rate of
lipid peroxide formation, it is important to remember
that this patient already has elevated lipid peroxide
results. That means that levels of b-carotene, CoQ10 and
vitamin E should be raised before the addition of flax
and fish oils. In most patients, a two week course of
aggressive fat-soluble vitamins will produce significant
improvements in membrane antioxidant status. Then the
supplemental oils are unlikely to cause further perturbation of the oxidative damage products. These cases call
for more short term follow up to assure that the lipid
peroxide levels do not rise excessively as the fatty acid
status improves.

## Amino Acid Status

The amino acid profile for Ms. B shows all amino
acids within normal limits except for slightly low values
for leucine and lysine (Table 12.13). Note especially the
arginine level. Here we find a value within normal limits,
while multiple metabolic markers indicated a functional
deficit of the nutrient. In addition, arginine is not considered an essential nutrient for adults. This example
illustrates how functional markers assist identification
of critical nutrient status. The simultaneous elevations
of citrate and orotate described above override the fact
that the circulating arginine concentration is within the
limits that the laboratory has approximated as “normal.”
A clinical trial of free form amino acids may produce a
favorable response when patterns of low and low-normal plasma amino acids are found as in this case. This
is especially worth considering with Ms. B who presented with multiple symptoms (fatigue, loss of mental
clarity, and depression) that are known to respond to

The data shown in Table 12.14 is from a

A special pattern of omega-3 dominance is found in
which the major imbalance is lack of the series 1 eicosanoid precursor, DGLA. In addition, severe (watersoluble) oxidative stress is shown by the greatly elevated
8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. The patient demonstrated a rapid increase in her energy and ability to function
normally when aggressive vitamin C, glycine (to assist
glutathione formation), Zn and evening primrose oil
was implemented. Her improvement indicates favorable
effects from the antioxidant support that can reduce inflammatory cycles. An unusual aspect is the indication
of improvement from enhancing series 1 eicosanoids
by addition of GLA. Although the more likely protocoldriven intervention would have been to use fish oils, the
laboratory data clearly points to the much more effective
use of primrose oil in this case.

As the running list of impressions listed in the text box shows, multiple nutrient insufficiencies with toxin loads exceeding detoxification capacities are initially
suspected. Initial laboratory evaluations included standard serum chemistries,
food-specific IgG antibody levels, plasma amino acids, urinary organic acids,
and erythrocyte minerals. Foods showing significantly elevated IgG levels were
egg, kidney bean, navy bean, and peanut. Moderate levels were found for milk
and string bean, and almond, pineapple, and lima bean showed low levels. The
amino acids, tyrosine, taurine, glycine, and serine were low in fasting plasma and
the sulfate to creatinine ratio was low, along with multiple elevations of bacterial
products in urine. Mineral insufficiencies were indicated by low erythrocyte magnesium and zinc. His serum cholesterol was slightly elevated.

Impressions:

Familial metabolic
lesions?

Mr. L was a forty-seven-year-old man who presented with a history of sinus
congestion and depression. He noted a family history of depression (father and
brother) and related that his first bout of severe depression, which required a
6-month course of standard medications, occurred after he had put himself on a
low calorie weight loss diet. As a child, he had a history of “hay fever” and recurrent ear infections, which were treated with multiple antibiotics. Asthma, which
seemed to be associated with environmental and food changes, was being controlled with occasional use of a steroid inhaler.
Additional family history included attention deficit disorder and chronic
sinusitis in both of Mr. L’s sons, ages 6 and 12. His parents’ deaths were due to
coronary artery disease and cancer. Mr. L experienced lactose intolerance with
symptoms of bloating and diarrhea when he consumed milk or ice cream. He had
hemorrhoids about every six months with rectal bleeding. He also had a recurrence of numbness and weakness in the extremities and leg cramps at night,
which were successfully treated with calcium. He complained of increasing symptoms of joint and muscle pain and headaches. The most annoying symptoms were
associated with a more recent degeneration of nasal membrane integrity. Symptoms of excessive mucus formation, stuffy nose, hay fever, and sinus problems
were all reported with severe effects. He had been on antibiotics five or six times
in the past year.

## Interventions
Mr. L was instructed about the use of an elimination/rotation diet in which all
foods with severe and moderate IgG reactions were eliminated. He was placed on
supplementation of a high-potency multivitamin-mineral, additional B-complex
vitamins, and a combination mineral product containing calcium, magnesium,
and zinc. A rice-based hypoallergenic medical food was used to support detoxification function and a broad-spectrum Lactobacillus formula, berberine, and

Pattern Analyis
grapefruit seed extract with calcium undecylenate were
used to reestablish orthobiosis.

Four Week Follow-up

At a four-week follow up visit, Mr. L reported
much improvement in GI symptoms with some improvement of sinus symptoms. The rice-based formula
was causing some reactions, so it was replaced with
fructo-oligosaccharide and glutamine to assist intestinal
healing. His health assessment questionnaire score had
dropped from 34 to 11, indicating significant improvement. At this time he was also advised to start a custom
amino acid powder that was produced according to the
description in Chapter 4, “Amino Acids.” At a twelveweek follow up, Mr. L reported that he is “feeling great’”
The sinus congestion was relieved within a few days of
starting the amino acids. His mood was steady and his
energy level was greatly impoved.

## Discussion

## Long-term Follow-up
Long-term follow up visits were done to check for
responses to additional, normal life stressors. At six
months, all previous areas of complaint were still much
improved and his serum cholesterol was within normal
limits. The health questionnaire score increased slightly
due to symptoms of seasonal allergies. At nine months,
Mr. L reported feeling “much, much better.” He says,
“Many problems are gone for good.” All IgG reaction
are markedly decreased and urinary sulfate and plasma
amino acids have all increased to normal or near-normal
limits.

of the symptoms would lead to a conclusion of overt
nutrient deficiency. Laboratory evaluation revealed the
multiple molecular nature of the problem. This “walking wounded” patient can now be described as walking
with intestinal hyperpermeability and small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth accompanied by an immune system
burden of IgG-antigen complexes. Nutrient insufficiencies are overlaid in this situation impeding the return of
wellness by restricting hepatic detoxification capacity.
The elimination of IgG-reactive foods and the apparent restoration of the intestinal barrier integrity helped
reduce the chronic challenge to the immune system. The
main presenting symptom involving the mucosal membranes was not completely resolved, however, until the
introduction of an extra ten grams of free form amino
acids and glutamine daily. This step may be considered
to have two critical effects. First, the repair of the tall
columnar epithelial cells of the gut is enhanced by the
improved availability of non-essential amino acids, especially glutamine, which is used for energy and regeneration by those cells. Glutamine sparing is accomplished
by supplying essential amino acids with cofactors, αKG,
and pyridoxal-5-phosphate. The second effect is that
of increased growth hormone activity with increasing
plasma amino acid levels. Mucosal membrane repair
is expected to accelerate under the action of growth
hormone.
The stages of healing in this case may be diagrammed as Gut  Nose  Brain. The insomnia and
depression were the final symptoms to clear. The origin
of mental improvement likely involved the reduction
of toxins flowing from the gut and the improvement of
neurotransmitter precursor availability because of improved amino acid intake and assimilation with lowered
detoxification demands.

This patient is typical of individuals who have been
described as “the walking wounded” who attempt to live
with annoying and mildly debilitating symptoms. None

After several months of decreased pain, Mr. F started experiencing increasing
bouts of profound fatigue and persistent lethargy. Testing of organic acids in urine
revealed very low levels of citrate and fumarate with simultaneous low VMA, the
neurotransmitter catabolite, and elevated 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionate the
Clostridium metabolic marker. Simultaneous profiling of trace elements in hair
showed elevation of mercury, while mercury was undetected in 24-hour urine.
The organic acid profile also revealed a low sulfate, indicating depletion of hepatic
conjugation pathways. A fasting plasma amino acid analysis revealed multiple low
levels of the essential amino acids plus low tyrosine and taurine.
The supplement program was shifted to include a customized free form amino
acid powder fortified with tyrosine and taurine. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was
added to boost glutathione production and assist in the mobilization of mercury.
This routine, with careful control of meal size, reduced his fatigue. A final effort
to identify endotoxin sources with fungal testing led to the finding of greatly
elevated IgG levels to Pullularia pullalans. Treatment with the antifungal agent,
Lamisil, while maintaining probiotic organisms, resulted in remission of persistent
musculoskeletal pain.

At the age of 34, Mr. F had experienced soft tissue pain for 12 years and
joint pain for the past two years. The pain was being controlled with Flexeril and
NSAIDs. For many years, he had experienced difficulty with sleep and multiple
symptoms of inflammatory bowel syndrome. The onset coincided with the start of
a stressful business after graduating from college.
A lactose/mannitol test showed normal carbohydrate assimilation with
hyperpermeability. Hydrogen breath test and stool cultures revealed bacterial
overgrowth. Very high levels of IgG class antibodies to milk, eggs, and chicken, all
of which were frequently consumed, were found.
The bowel syptoms were improved with regular consumption of steamed
vegetables, supplementing antioxidant vitamins, and avoidance of challenging
foods. The favorable organisms, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, were also
supplemented and within ten weeks the joint and soft tissue pain was virtually
absent without medication, and bowel and sleep habits became normal. Over the
next year he also noticed fewer upper respiratory infections.

## Mrs. O’s Fibromyalgia
## Chief Complaints — Medical History

A 50-year-old white female, Mrs. O, presented at the clinic with
postmenopausal symptoms of severe hot flashes and depression. She had been
diagnosed 10 years prior with fibromyalgia, a debilitating illness characterized by
severe muscle aches and pain, fatigue and depression. The only treatment that
had seemed to help her was Prozac, which controlled her pain although, with the
advent of menopause, depression was still a factor. She had been taking hormone
replacement, Premarin and progesterone for 2 years. This helped with the hot
flashes but also made her very irritable. At the time she first visited the clinic, the
fibromyalgia pain had returned to a significant degree, and she was tired all the
time, depressed, retaining water and wanted to get off her medications as she felt
they were affecting her adversely. Her health assessment questionaire score showed
a very high self-assessment of adverse symptoms. She commented to one of the
doctors, “I give myself 8 months. If this treatment doesn’t work, then I want to end
it all, as life was not worth living this way.

## Test Results

Blood chemistries and complete blood count were normal except for elevated
cholesterol. The organic acid analysis indicated multiple functional B vitamin deficiencies that can significantly affect her body’s ability to generate energy. The amino
acid panel revealed significant essential amino acid deficiencies (8 out of 10). The
IgG1&4 food allergy panel indicated adverse reactions to milk and wheat.

## Treatment Protocol

At the clinic that treated Mrs. O, part of the routine treatment protocol for
all diagnosed fibromyalgia patients is a series of vitamin and mineral intravenous
(IV) infusions, two per week for one month. They have found this to significantly
accelerate the recovery of these patients. In addition, the patient is put on a
regimen of oral nutrients designed to correct the biochemical imbalances detected
by the testing.
Mrs. O’s treatment included a high potency multiple vitamin and mineral,
extra B-complex, chromium, omega 3 fatty acids, extra magnesium in liquid
form, betaine HCl and pepsin as a digestive/absorptive aid, black cohosh and soy
isoflavones to help with the hot flash symptoms. She also used a custom blended
essential amino acid mixture formulated according to amino acid levels found in
her test. A medical food product designed to treat systemic inflammatory processes
and a probiotic supplement to help normalize bowel microflora was also included.
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was recommended before bed. Since the patient
was also taking Prozac, this was slowly tapered off as the 5-HTP was increased.
Methylsulfonyl methane (MSM) was recommended for its anti-inflammatory
properties. Milk and wheat were removed from her diet for four weeks to
determine potential adverse immunologic consequences of elevated IgG levels
found for these foods.

Illustrative Scenarios

## Follow-up: 2 Weeks
The IV infusions were painful for her and took longer
than normal. She developed an itchy rash that went away
upon stopping the MSM. She had stopped all hormone replacement and feels worse than ever. However, she understood that she may feel worse before she feels better due
to the changes her body must go through to get healthy.

## Follow-up: 6 Weeks

The IV infusions were no longer painful and she
was experiencing much more energy and was pain free.
She had not taken Prozac for four weeks and felt very
upbeat emotionally. Her hot flashes had stabilized and
were infrequent and mild now. She felt the supplements
had helped a lot with that. She had lost several pounds
and was no longer bloated. An additional intravenous
magnesium solution was started. She reported that it
relaxes her and makes her feel “happy.”

## Follow-up: 12 Weeks
The patient continued feeling well. IVs were
reduced to once a month for maintenance. Her supplement schedule was reduced to maintenance levels. Her
health assessment questionaire score was down from 83
to 12, reflecting greatly reduced pain and discomfort.

All clinical assessment is a matter of pattern recognition. Patterns of signs and symptoms make syndromes
and lead to pathognomonic disease definition. In molecular medicine, patterns can lead to greater specificity
of nutrient deficiency and aggressiveness of intervention for a given case. Sometimes multiple profiles of
apparent disparate functions are found to form links
that direct the clinician’s attention to the more pertinent
system failure. Concurrent findings of multiple food
allergies, along with metabolic markers of intestinal
bacterial overgrowth and elevated markers of free radical
pathology are a good example of combining multiple
profiles to reach a diagnostic conclusion. Any one of the
three testing areas might lead to correct interventions,
but together, they point to the nature of the problem
as an inflammatory bowel with degeneration of both
immune and physical barriers and resulting increased
antioxidant demand.
Tables 12.15 to 12.20 illustrate clusters of data that
amplify clinical insight about nutritional interventions.
The following section presents an illustration of how
such clusters are used with patient history and physical information in specific patients. Each one presents a
different scenario with differing starting point observations. The tables should be read from top to bottom as a
temporal sequence of tests that were performed.

## Discussion

While this patient had a particularly successful
outcome, most fibromyalgia patients notice significant
improvement in their symptoms with this therapeutic
approach. The aggressive IV nutrient protocol increased
the percentage of successful outcomes at this clinic.

Notes:

Conclusion
The clinical situations and cases presented in this
chapter serve to illustrate the following:
1. Modern degenerative diseases are of complex
origin and the progression of symptoms is
dependent on each patient’s history. Complex
cases that defy classical diagnosis and therapy
may be amenable to molecular medicine
approaches that depend on identification
of nutrients, toxins, or metabolic controls
that are at the root of the problem.

3. Laboratory evaluations can identify the
interventions that are required for restoration of
normal function. The laboratory results allow
focused interventions of specific nutrients in
doses adjusted according to the severity of the
depletion and related metabolic impairment.

2. Complex cases must be approached in a
way that restores normal function to cells,
tissues, and organs. Simple, safe means such
as nutrient supplements, food derivatives,
and probiotic organisms, when used in
the appropriate levels for a given patient,
can restore normality to biochemical
processes that control cell function.

primary laboratory measure of CVD risk should be
evaluated in light of the fact that 50% of all those who
experience a coronary event have normal cholesterol
levels. Clearly there are other factors that should
be evaluated that may have even greater impact on
cardiovascular health and disease.
The following tables list the different analytes that
can be measured to assess CVD risk and various nutritional interventions that can be used to modify these
risk factors. Literature references are provided for further
information on the value of each analyte in assessment
of CVD risk and treatment.

This book is organized by category of tests and
how they can be applied to different disease processes.
A reverse approach is to focus on a particular disease
and see how various tests can be combined to guide
therapeutic decisions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
presents a good opportunity to demonstrate this
approach since its etiology is mutifactorial and can
include inflammation, oxidant stress, hormone function,
and other factors, all of which are influenced by nutrient
status. The exclusive use of serum cholesterol as the

primary hypothyroidism. Their limits are in the range
of 80% of broadly defined reference populations. Thus,
mildly elevated cholesterol or parathyroid hormone
levels are assessed in ways similar to essential nutrient
abnormalities. Interventions are planned to avoid or
slow the progression to frank diseases. For tests that assess essential nutrient status, identifying individuals who
are outside of 80% limits (first or fifth quintiles) was
discussed in Chapter 1, “Basic Concepts.”
The previous chapters have discussed many ways
in which nutrient insufficiencies and toxicant effects can
be part of the underlying origin of metabolic diseases.
Generally, the chronic, degenerative diseases that are diagnosed with the aid of standard serum chemistries are
tied to earlier events that may be observed in the special
nutrient and toxicant assessments. The table in this appendix is intended to help identify specific relationships
that might be investigated to improve patient outcomes.

Notes:

Standard serum chemistry test panels are designed
largely to assist with the diagnosis of diseases, such as
heart disease, liver failure or kidney failure. The abnormality limits for this type of test are usually set to
show abnormality only when results are outside 95%
of reference population values. The limits may also be
determined by measurements performed on cohorts of
subjects and controls that are defined by independent
criteria. These procedures produce high sensitivity and
specificity for the tests so that the rate of correct identification of the presence or absence of diseases is high.
Two exceptions to the rule of 95% limits are serum
cholesterol and serum thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH). These tests are used for disease risk assessment in
addition to diagnosis of frank hypercholesterolemia and

Interactions of Drugs, Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Components

Table C.1 — Drug-Nutrient Interactions

Analgesic

Drug Type

Affected Nutrients

Mechanism

Aspirin, salicylates

Vitamin C,
Folic Acid,
Glycine,
Histidine,
Potassium,
Zinc,
Vitamin K

Drug most likely to produce vitamin C deficiency in
normal individuals. Chronic use can cause iron depletion
due to blood loss in GI tract. Aspirin depletes folic acid
by displacing bound serum folate. Causes urinary loss
of potassium. Depletion-related symptoms: weakness
& low energy from anemia. Salicylates in high doses
can reduce vitamin K epoxide reductase, resulting in
vitamin K deficiency. Detoxification effects: Salicylates
can decrease histidine levels. Aspirin overdose depletes
plasma glycine.

Estrogens

Vitamin B6,
Folic Acid

Estrogen metabolism interferes with absorption of
both folic acid and vitamin B6. Since B6 is involved with
synthesis of serotonin, depletion can cause anxiety,
depression, sleep disturbances, and irritability. Anemia
from folate depletion causes weakness and low energy.
Low levels of folic acid are associated with increased
incidence of birth defects, cervical dysplasia, and
elevated homocysteine, which is a major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease.

Oral Contraceptives

Vitamins A, B2,
B6,B12, C,
Folic Acid,
Zinc,
Magnesium

Studies show reduced serum levels of nutrients listed
with use of OCs. Depletions of vitamins B6, B12, and
C are not as frequently seen with the use of newer
low dose estrogen OCs. Zinc deficiency can lead to
depressed growth, poor immune function, and alopecia.
OCs may increase serum retinol.

Hydralazine (Apresoline)

Vitamin B6,
Magnesium

Loop Diuretics:
Furosemide (Lasix),
Bumetamide (Bumex),
Torsemide (Demadex),
Ethacrynic acid (Edecrin)

Magnesium,
Vitamin B1,
Vitamin B6,
Potassium,
Zinc

Diuretic-induced magnesium and potassium deficiencies
can cause increased irregularities in heartbeat blood
pressure. Increased urination may also cause depletion
of vitamins B1 and B6. Chronic use of furosemide can
cause B1 deficiency.

Thiazide Diuretics:
Hydrochlorothiazide
(Esidrix, HydroDIURIL),
Indapamide (Lozol), and
Metolazone (Zaroxolyn)

Magnesium,
Potassium,
Sodium,
Zinc

Urinary depletion of magnesium and potassium
can exacerbate irregular blood pressure and cardiac
function. Zinc depletion can suppress wound healing
and immune function. Hyponatremia could also
develop.

Affected Nutrients

Mechanism

Barbiturates:
Phenobarbital (Luminal
Sodium), Pentobarbital
(Nembutal Sodium),
Thiopental, Secobarbital
(Seconal), Methohexital

Vitamin D,
Calcium,
Folic Acid

Long-term use interferes with vitamin D metabolism and
may reduce the absorption of calcium. Phenobarbital
may reduce plasma levels of vitamins D and E. Folic acid
levels are lowered in both plasma and erythrocytes.

Vitamins D, E,
Calcium,
Folic Acid,
Vitamin B12,
Biotin

Decreases vitamin D availability, reducing absorption
of calcium. Decreases serum folate and Phenytoin may
decrease vitamins D and E in plasma. Vitamin B12 and
folic acid absorption are also decreased. Can increase
biotin metabolism, decreasing biotin plasma levels.
Carbamazepine inhibits folate absorption; long-term
use could create anemia. Carbamazepine decreases
plasma levels of vitamin E and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate.
These depletions can result in bone disease, anemia,
neurological problems, as well as gum and periodontal
disease.

Calcium,
Vitamin D,
Potassium,
Selenium

These drugs reduce levels of vitamin D and decrease the
absorption of calcium, resulting in bone loss and skeletal
problems. Long-term use may also deplete potassium,
selenium, and zinc.

Corticosteroids:
Prednisone (Meticorten),
Dexamethasone
(Decadron),
Methylprednisolone

Phenytoin (Dilantin),

Decreases absorption of both vitamin C and folic acid.
Increases rate of gastric emptying which decreases
absorption of amino acids. Indocin can cause iron
deficiency due to blood loss.

Folic Acid

These anti-inflammatory drugs competitively inhibit the
enzymatic synthesis of folic acid. Long-term use could
lead to anemia. Low levels of folic acid are associated
with increased incidence of birth defects, cervical
dysplasia, and elevated homocysteine, a major risk
factor for cardiovascular disease.

Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)

Folic Acid

Intestinal absorption of folic acid is inhibited, which can
lead to anemia-related weakness and low energy.

Metal-binding:
Penicillamine

Copper,

Affected Nutrients

Mechanism

All B-Vitamins,
Biotin,
Vitamin C,
Vitamin K

Antibiotics kill pathogenic and beneficial bacteria
such as Acidophilus and Bifidus. The “friendly bacteria”
produce vitamins B2, B3, B6, B12, K, biotin, folic acid,
pantothenic acid, and a number of natural antibiotics
in our intestines. Destroying acidophilus & bifidus
bacteria can cause nutrient depletions and impair
the immune system.

Magnesium-containing antacids can decrease manganese
absorption if taken concomitantly. Aluminum hydroxide
may decrease vanadium absorption.

Vitamin B12,
Calcium,
Folic Acid,
Vitamin D,
Iron,
Zinc,
Protein

Malabsorption of dietary B12, iron, and folic acid by
H-2 antagonists may contribute to nutrient depletions.
Altered pH may also reduce absorption of calcium,
vitamin D, and zinc. Altering gastric pH also interferes
with digestion of protein. Folic acid depletion is
associated with increased incidence of birth defects,
cervical dysplasia, and elevated homocysteine, a major
risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Anti-fungal

Folate
