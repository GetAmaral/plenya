## Chapter 9: Oxidant Stress

Richard S. Lord, J. Alexander Bralley and Kara N. Fitzgerald

Oxidative stress is a condition in cells where excessive production of highly reactive molecules called free
radicals damage cellular components. When production of free radicals becomes excessive, the antioxidant
mechanisms of the cell become overwhelmed and free
radical action is not controlled, leading to impaired cell
function. Potential targets include lipid membranes;
proteins, leading to enzyme inactivation or receptor malfunction; and DNA, leading to mutations and
potential cancers. Since oxidant stress can affect cellular
function at many levels, it has been thought to be an
etiological factor in many disease states,1 including diseases of the eye,2 Alzheimer’s disease3–5 and other types
of neuronal injury,6 atherosclerosis, cancer, rheumatic
diseases, allergic inflammation,7, 8 cardiac and cerebral
ischemia, respiratory distress syndrome, various renal9
and liver disorders,10 irradiation, thermal injury, and
toxicity induced by certain metals, solvents, pesticides,
and drugs.11–14 Even in healthy individuals, the constant,
normal degradation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS)
are thought to explain common effects of aging.5, 15, 16
The reaction depicted in Figure 9.3 leads to potential
accumulation of oxidized fats in cell membranes. This

mechanism has been proposed to alter membrane
fluidity and affect cell-mediated immunity.17 The importance of membrane fluidity was discussed in Chapter 5,
“Fatty Acids.”
Antioxidants are ubiquitously distributed in various
cellular compartments to protect against the pathological consequences of ROS accumulation, as depicted in
Figure 9.2. The evidence for disease protection from
a single antioxidant, vitamin E, has led to the launching of large-scale studies of vitamin E supplementation
in patients with early Parkinson’s disease,18 and as a
suppressant of free radical damage during cardiopulmonary bypass operations.19 Although many studies have
reported clinical benefits from single antioxidants used
at high doses, unless such interventions are specifically
indicated, balanced levels of the various antioxidants
required for tissue protection is important in long-term
patient management.
Free radicals are partially reduced metabolites of
oxygen or, in some cases, nitrogen. The free radical molecule contains an unpaired electron in its outer orbital,
making it highly reactive and unstable (see Figure 9.1).
Other molecules that encounter the radical tend to lose
single electrons, becoming oxidized. When a single electron from the mitochondrial electron transport system
is captured by molecular oxygen, a radical form called

Figure 9.2 — Distribution of Antioxidants

The blood, cytosol and organelles contain multiple antioxidant systems to protect against oxidative damage. In structures
with high lipid content such as the cell membrane (shown enlarged relative to organelle membranes), the less polar
antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin A and carotenoids predominate. The aqueous cytosol and interior of organelles
are sites where glutathione, vitamin C and the enzyme systems operate. The mitochondria are particularly susceptible to
oxidative damage due to their high rate of redox reactions transferring electrons to oxygen. The release of cytochrome
C from damaged mitochondria initiates apoptosis. In the blood, protection of proteins and small molecules is needed to
protect soluble proteins, erythrocytes and endothelial cells against oxidative damage. Blood is especially susceptible to
oxidative damage due to the high amounts of oxygen that are constantly in flux from erythrocyte hemoglobin-binding
sites. In addition to the other cellular antioxidants, the plasma is protected by high concentrations of albumin and uric acid.
The interior of erythrocytes contains high levels of taurine and selenium-glutathione peroxidase.

away can create considerable trouble for the cell.25, 26
Thus, the largest source of ROS is mitochondrial respiration.27 Even slight insufficiencies of CoQ10, iron, heme or
cytochromes can cause disruptions in the massive flow
of electrons through these systems.
A major mechanism for removal of superoxide is the
action of superoxide dismutase. The product hydrogen
peroxide is less reactive, but, in the presence of free
ferrous iron (Fe2+), it is converted into the extremely
reactive hydroxyl radical. Hydroxyl radical attack on a
polyunsaturated fatty acid is depicted in Figure 9.3.

Free radical chain reactions can be terminated when
antioxidants donate a single electron to the free radical,
stabilizing the compound (Figure 9.4). The antioxidant
reactant is either permanently altered or recovered by
an electron transfer from another antioxidant. Antioxidant effects are also achieved by sequential reactions
catalyzed by enzymes with their elemental cofactors
acting in concert with antioxidant vitamins and normal
metabolic intermediates to quench oxidative stress. High
levels of a single antioxidant with insufficient levels of
another may not provide adequate protection. Laboratory evaluations of antioxidant levels and oxidative stress
markers can help to guide treatment protocols.
The pathology found in Down’s syndrome illustrates
how a perturbation at a single locus of the antioxidant
protection system can produce adverse cellular effects.
The genetic origin of Down’s syndrome is the presence
of duplicate copies of chromosome 21 (thus the alternate designation as trisomy 21). Since the superoxide
dismutase (SOD) gene resides on chromosome 21,
affected individuals produce levels of this enzyme that
are 40 to 50% higher than controls.28 Although the
SOD-catalyzed reaction reduces levels of superoxide,
its product is hydrogen peroxide, which is still quite
reactive. Increased rates of oxidative damage have been
found in various tissues of Down’s patients, including
the brain.29, 30 Results from cell culture studies indicate
the presence of stress on the glutathione system in cells
with higher SOD levels.31 The glutathione response is
highly adaptable to varying levels of oxidative stress, but
the oxidative challenge in Down’s syndrome is too great
to offset with up-regulation of the glutathione and other
antioxidant systems. The oxidative stress also results
in lower levels of plasma vitamin E, and the damage to
chromosomes is reduced by supplementing vitamin E.32
Since the most intense and continuous site of
redox activity is the mitochondria, understanding their
changes in disease and their response to therapy is
needed. Studies on isolated mitochondria have shown
that metabolic stimulation by succinate causes dramatic
rise in ROS formation.33, 34 These results demonstrate
how any therapy that stimulates oxidative metabolism of
glucose or fatty acids can places stress on the mitochondrial electron transport chain. If mitochondrial CoQ10 is
unable to meet the demand for increased electron flux,

then ROS formation increases. Thus, a patient requiring
initial therapy with carnitine and B-complex vitamins
for fatty acid mobilization and oxidative metabolism
can enter into a state of oxidative challenge because of
insufficient mitochondrial CoQ10 or cytochromes due to
lag in porphyrin synthesis. If the porphyrin pathway is
inhibited by environmental toxins, the risk of oxidative
challenge is further increased. See Chapter 6, “Organic
Acids,” and Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification,”
for further discussions of markers for assessment of mitochondrial metabolism and porphyrin pathway status,
respectively.

Antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that prevent oxidative
damage in biological systems. The term generally implies
the nutritionally essential or conditionally essential elements (i.e., selenium) and compounds (i.e., vitamin E),
whose primary function is free radical scavenging. A frequent broadening of meaning is to include the enzymes

Reactive oxygen species, such as O2• and OH•, can damage tissues unless they are removed by electron transfer to vitamins
A, C and E, or by enzymatic conversions of superoxide, first to hydrogen peroxide and then to harmless water. The enzymatic
conversions are dependent on adequate supply of amino acids, vitamins and essential minerals.
Scenario I shows the removal of hydrogen peroxide by either direct conversion to water or by oxidation of glutathione. The
pentose phosphate pathway assures the supply of NADPH-reducing equivalents. In scenario II, an electron transfer from a
membrane fatty acid is processed through antioxidants of decreasing electron acceptor potential, but of increasing cellular
concentrations and regenerative capacity. Scenario III shows the potential involvement of lipoic acid for regeneration of
oxidized forms of glutathione and thioredoxin, two critical components of cellular response to oxidative stress.

A perfectly legitimate further broadening that is rarely
implied is to include those products of normal human
metabolism that have similar actions toward ROS.

Albumin antioxidant capacity can be protected by
increased levels of low-molecular-weight antioxidants.46
Paradoxically, the binding of copper to albumin causes
increased rates of serum LDL oxidation. The binding of
Cu++ to albumin seems to cause it to have pro-oxidant
enzyme activity.47 The alteration of albumin by copper
may, in turn, be diminished by the binding of serum
copper to bilirubin.48 This sequence of interactions illustrates ways in which multiple factors affect a patient’s
overall response to oxidative stress. Patients with conditions producing low serum albumin (Table 9.3) are at
increased risk of oxidative stress effects.

Some details of how glutathione (GSH) is used
in human detoxification systems was presented in
Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification.” The rate of
glutathione synthesis can vary greatly, depending on
levels of oxidative stress.49 Although accurate values for
the total-body capacity for glutathione synthesis have
not been reported, we can get some idea of the magnitude from studies in cell suspensions of the brassicacae
Arabidopsis. When those cells are treated for an extended
period beyond the initial 2- to 3-hour surge with the oxidizer monochlorobimane, they produce up to 8.9 nmol
GSH/g fresh weight. This amount corresponds to more
than 27 kg for a 70 kg human. Even allowing a 100-fold
superiority for Arabidopsis, daily output of even 250 g
is a massive peptide synthesis level. The limiting factors

Although there is no single pathway that can be
predicted for the electron transfers that are initiated by
ROS, several commonly used steps have been identified. The highly reactive ROS of Table 9.2 can initiate electron transfer to any compound of lower redox
potential. However, the biological systems tend to direct
the electrons in orderly sequences, such as those shown
in Figure 9.4.
At each level, antioxidants transfer electrons to
another member of lower oxidative potential in the
chain of electron acceptors until a stable compound
is formed. The radical electrons ultimately leave the
body as water or a reduced form of an antioxidant. The
electrons must be passed down in a controlled process
from one acceptor to another. Vitamin E is one of the
major protective compounds in cell membranes because
it can accept high-energy electrons from compounds
like hydroxyl radicals. For example, transfer of a single
electron from a hydroxyl radical to vitamin E gives a
molecule of lower redox activity. The vitamin E radical is
still an unwanted oxidant, however, that should pass the
electron to a carrier that has intermediate reactivity like
that of β-carotene or cytochromes. Studies associating an
increased rate of lung cancer in smokers who supplemented β-carotene may relate to this phenomenon.
Scenarios of typical free radical chain breaking with
antioxidant restoration are shown in Figure 9.4.
Ascorbate, vitamin E, selenium, zinc and the cysteine-containing tripeptide glutathione are some of the
more important compounds that protect against radical
damage. As discussed in Chapter 3, “Amino Acids,” even
insufficiency of glycine can restrict glutathione synthesis.
Important enzymes (and their cofactors) include catalase
(no cofactor), glutathione peroxidase (selenium), glutathione reductase (riboflavin) and superoxide dismutase

under chronic oxidative stress stimulation become the
supply of cysteine (or methionine) and glycine.
The disulfide chemical group in glutathione makes
a particularly suitable, soft landing point for electrons
that cause damage if left associated with reactive oxygen
molecules. This chemical uniqueness allows understanding of why glutathione is a universal cell reduction-oxidation balancing molecule. It is ubiquitous in human
tissues, and deficiencies are related to many and varied
causes of disease. Low levels of the sulfur amino acids
methionine, taurine and homocysteine in plasma may
be due to chronic high demand for glutathione synthesis.50, 51 Similarly, levels of glycine, serine and threonine
may fall when glutathione synthesis is chronically
demanded.52 Other markers of glutathione adequacy
(α-hydroxybutyrate, pyroglutamate and sulfate) are discussed in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” Supplementation
of glutathione, L-cysteine and anthocyanins restored
immunologic function with reduction of symptoms in
12 children with allergic asthma and recurrent respiratory diseases.53 These results give evidence regarding the
clinical significance of glutathione restriction in patients
with conditions that generate chronic oxidative stress.

## Antioxidant Nutrients

Human cells possess intricate protective systems
against oxidative damage.54 An important concept in
antioxidant interventions is the potential for imbalance
in antioxidants because they function in concert. Oxygen
free radicals are normal components of mitochondrial
membranes and are a problem only when they are formed
in an uncontrolled fashion. Similarly, if antioxidants like
beta-carotene and vitamin E are consumed in amounts out
of proportion with the total spectrum of electron acceptors, the antioxidants can become a part of the problem.

Multiple nutritional factors may afford protection from

may enhance hydrogen peroxide production and oxidative damage.56 Adaptive systems can increase rates of enzyme synthesis, especially those required for glutathione
production.57 Laboratory evaluations are available that
allow assessment of the current rate of oxidative damage
and the adequacy of antioxidant protection against further damage. Markers of oxidant damage to fatty acids
(membranes), proteins and DNA are available as well
as various indicators of overall or specific antioxidant
protection.

who regularly consume isoflavones-rich foods.59 Plasma
antioxidant status, homocysteinemia and endothelial
response have been shown to be improved by increasing
dietary isoflavone intake.60-62 Other dietary polyphenols
such as the catechins, may contribute appreciable antioxidant protection also.63

Copper, Manganese, Selenium,
Zinc and Riboflavin

Refer to Case Illustration 9.1

## Copper, manganese, selenium, zinc and riboflavin
are considered antioxidant nutrients because they play
specific roles as cofactors for the enzymes that catalyze
reactions that remove oxygen radicals. These nutrients
are cofactors (or precursor vitamins) for the enzymes
glutathione reductase (FAD),64 glutathione peroxidase
(Se),65 and superoxide dismutase (Cu, Mn, Zn).66 Totalbody selenium is so largely dedicated to this role that
some studies have evaluated overall oxidative protection
by measuring serum and urinary selenium along with
red cell enzymes.67 Laboratory evaluations and specific
metabolic roles for the antioxidant trace elements are
discussed in Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements.”

Laboratory evaluations for these nutrients are
discussed in Chapter 2. They all play critical roles in
the chain of electron acceptors that allows removal of
oxygen radicals. Vitamin A and its precursor β-carotene
have independent actions in this process, and the various isomers of tocopherol likewise operate with redox
potentials uniquely beneficial to specific tissues.
Vitamins C and E are major players in antioxidant
protection. The clinical value of β-carotene testing may
be as a marker of good dietary habits rather than as a
direct indicator of antioxidant status, since it may be an
insignificant factor in free radical protection.58
Profiling fat-soluble vitamins in serum has been
reviewed in Chapter 2. Such testing provides direct
concentration measures for vitamins A and E, along with
β-carotene and coenzyme Q10. These are the principal
molecules examined for deficiencies to reveal need for
augmenting dietary intake. More comprehensive profiles
are available that include the various minor isomers of
vitamin A (carotenoids) and vitamin E (tocopherols).

## Vitamins A, C and E and β-Carotene

Isoflavones
The polyphenolic isoflavones, such as genistein
and daidzein found in soy, have extensive antioxidant
properties. Because they undergo extensive metabolism
in the intestine, however, as discussed in Chapter 6,
“Organic Acids,” it is not possible to infer systemic
antioxidant contributions from their in vitro properties.
Antioxidant potentials measured for the common products that are absorbed after bacterial metabolism suggest
Can Antioxidant Supplements
Be Dangerous to Health?
The “Of Further Interest” box on the following
pages deals with the issue of poorly designed studies
that can raise unnecessary questions about the safety of
antioxidant supplementation in clinical practice. The
particular report addressed there drew questionable
conclusions that led to news headlines such as “Anti­
oxidants Increase All-Cause Mortality.”
Before presenting data that suggest real dangers, and
at the risk of stating the obvious, a practical note may be
worthy. Treating individual patients who have nutrient
insufficiencies demonstrated by laboratory evaluations is
not in any way comparable to population-based studies
that examine average outcomes of disease incidence. A
great many published studies use a design of supplementing subject and control populations without any
qualification of the participants’ initial nutrient status.
This approach derives frequently from the misplaced
focus on the curing of disease by simply increasing
nutrient intake. Such results are categorically irrelevant
to the common sense interventions to correct demonstrated nutrient deficiencies in patients with diseases
(to aid recovery) or without them (to reduce risk of

against DNA damage and resistance to oxidative damage
in those treated with beta-carotene, ascorbic acid and
alpha-tocopherol,82 supporting the conclusion that that
supplementing with limited antioxidants at high doses
may be problematic.83
Functional and direct assessment of antioxidant
elements, nutrients and vitamins, as well as assessment
of markers of oxidative stress will allow the clinician to
design an appropriately individualized treatment plan.
Degree of specific antioxidant deficiency as well as the
severity of oxidative damage will guide the clinician in
the dosing and duration of needed nutrients. In patients
under extreme oxidative stress, such as smokers and
alcoholics, a whole-foods diet with a broad complement
of antioxidant nutrients is likely the safest alternative to
high-dose single antioxidant supplementation.

Markers of
Oxidant Damage
Oxidative effects in Down’s syndrome illustrate both
the origins of oxidative stress and the value of testing
that allows monitoring the adequacy of antioxidant controls. The extra copy of chromosome 21 in Down’s syndrome contains a gene for superoxide dismutase. This
enzyme is critical for oxidant protection, but it is only
one of the links in the chain of normal electron transfer.
Tissue levels of superoxide dismutase can be 40% higher

incidence). The figure inset in the “Of Further Interest”
box illustrates laboratory results that show contrasting
scenarios where antioxidant supplements should be
added or withheld.
Under certain circumstances, antioxidant supplementation may be harmful. For example, the ATBC
and CARET studies have shown that individuals who
smoke tobacco and regularly drink alcohol show slightly
increased risk of lung cancer if they use high-dose supplements of beta-carotene without regard to how high their
beta-carotene status may become.71-73 Long-term followup in both studies showed a return to baseline incidence
levels when supplementation was discontinued, further
confirming the effect of beta-carotene. The mechanism of
SOD association with Down’s syndrome discussed above
provides one possible explanation of these beta-carotene
results. Specifically, a great excess of a single member in
an antioxidant cascade can become a challenge to the rest
of the system. This is particularly true in an excessively
oxidative milieu, such as the lungs of a heavy smoker,74 or
the liver of an alcoholic.75 Excessive intake of one nutrient with a deficiency of another can result in oxidative
damage. Further, the antioxidant itself, when given alone,
may become oxidized and damaging. However, properly
balanced supplementation with the same antioxidants can
produce reduced cancer incidence.74
A few vitamin E studies have reported increased risk
of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, although
other studies have challenged the findings.76-79 The
ATBC study demonstrated that 50 mg of vitamin E in
rural elderly male smokers increased the incidence of
the common cold by 58%, whereas their less-smoking
city-dwelling counterparts had a reduction in incidence
of 46%.80
Although the negative findings in the beta-carotene
studies were associated with smokers who drank alcohol, the vitamin E findings are less-clearly associated
with such risk factors. Indeed, the ATBC findings with
regards to vitamin E make drawing such conclusions
tricky at best. Further confounding is the fact there was
a reduced incidence of lung cancer in the ATBC control
group when there was either higher baseline serum betacarotene or increased dietary intake of beta-carotene
during the study.71 The CARET study also demonstrated
a protective effect of increased dietary carotenoid intake
in the placebo arm of the study, although no such difference was found in the active arm.81 A study looking at
an animal lung cancer model showed a protective effect

Safety and Efficacy of Antioxidant Supplements

A proper meta-analysis incorporates only like
studies; however, Bjelakovic et al. allowed for any
dosage, duration and combination of antioxidants,
creating immense variability for comparing outcomes.
Vitamin C dosage ranged from 60 to 2,000 mg; trial
lengths ranged from 3 months to 12 years; antioxidant
supplementation ranged from a single dose of vitamin
A in one trial, to combined supplementation for
12 years. Comments to JAMA’s editors regarding
supplement duration included the following: “dying
from a supplement after only a few months of use
seems biologically implausible,” and “the finding
that supplementation duration had no effect on
total mortality diminishes the likelihood that these
micronutrients increase the risk of death.” 91
The use of all-cause mortality as the end point
of this analysis was suspect. Huang et al. stated that
“the establishment of causality of increased all-cause
mortality would require the inclusion of data not
included in the study, such as temporal and doseresponse relationships, evidence of effects disappearing
after supplement discontinuation and recurrence after
resuming supplementation.”91 Albanes notes that almost
half (405 of 815) of the studies originally identified in
the literature were excluded from the analysis because
they observed no deaths. Of the 68 trials that did have
deaths, many were small (12 trials had only 1 death),
which increases the significance of a few large trials.93
Additionally, a biologically plausible mechanism for the
increase in all-cause mortality, which includes not only
death from disease, but also accidents and suicide, was
not hypothesized by the authors.
The process of trial selection used by Bjelakovic
et al. was aggressively challenged as being biased.90-93
To establish statistical significance, the final 68 trials
used (from an original pool of 815) were further
reduced by 21, which were labeled as high-biased.
A high-biased trial was defined as having one or
more unclear or inadequate methodological quality
components. Without the elimination of these trials,

Numerous research papers have demonstrated

disease prevention, and dosages considered to be safe
have been established by the Institute of Medicine
(IOM).84–88 The question of safety and efficacy for
antioxidant supplementation, however, continues to
be scrutinized in prestigious medical journals with a
zeal that seems to go beyond a straightforward search
for truth. One such paper was published in JAMA in
February 2007. It made international news with the
sensationalistic statement that antioxidant supplements cause increased all-cause mortality.89 An immediate influx of letters to the editors of JAMA called into
question the methodology and findings of the study,
demonstrating that the data appeared “cherry-picked”
by the authors, and therefore incorrect.90-94
The JAMA study in question, “Mortality in
Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for
Primary and Secondary Prevention,” by Bjelakovic
et al.,89 is a meta-analysis (a statistical analysis of
data combined from two or more trials with the aim
of increasing statistical significance by using a larger
study population). The authors looked at the use of
beta-carotene, vitamins A, C and E; and selenium,
either singly or combined vs. placebo or vs. no
intervention. The studies used in the analysis were all
randomized controlled trials (RCT), which are widely
accepted as the gold standard in study design, but for
a number of reasons have received criticism for their
inability to accurately assess antioxidant efficacy.95-97

“Clinicians should carefully
and critically read an original
paper’s methodology before
accepting the popular
media’s version of the truth.”

the finding of increased all-cause mortality was not
significant. When considered alone, the high-biased
trials demonstrated overall a significant reduction of
mortality. There was a further elimination of 21 trials
involving the supplementation of selenium. After the
exclusion of these trials, it left only 26 trials from the
original 815. The exclusion of the selenium trials also
appears to support the authors’ thesis of increased allcause mortality. As Albanes states, “it would be useful
to know what hypotheses formed the basis for the
[exclusion] of selenium and high-biased risk trials.93
Taylor and Dawsey pointed out the excluded “highbias” Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention
Trial was identical methodologically to a trial included
in the low-biased group, and, therefore, it should not
have been excluded as high-biased.90 Huang et al. also
challenged the definition of “low-biased,” stating that a
lack of reporting of certain methodological details may
have been mistaken as lacking high quality.91
The bulk of the studies included in the metaanalysis were secondary prevention trials, meaning
that the subjects are already ill with specific diseases.

Under this design, the supplement is being evaluated
for evidence of cure for an illness and/or life extension.
These types of trials cast antioxidant supplements in a
poor light, since they are never promoted as cures for
disease; rather, their benefit is in disease prevention.
The studies were all randomized controlled trials,
which have been criticized as being limited in their
ability to evaluate the multifaceted effects of antioxidant
supplementation for disease prevention as described
in this chapter. Long-term observational studies to
investigate the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation
as protective or preventative is a superior design for
evaluation of their efficacy.96, 97
The Bjelakovic report illustrates an apparent bias
amongst the editors of leading medical journals against
the use of nutrients in health care. Clinicians should
carefully and critically read an original paper’s methodology before accepting the popular media’s version of
the truth. Although care in choosing dosage, form and
duration of any nutrient supplementation is important,
appropriate use of antioxidant nutrients appears both
safe and effective.

in Down’s patients compared with individuals with the
normal chromosome count. The increased conversion
of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide leads to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and increased rates of oxidant
damage. Oxidative damage to membrane lipids and
DNA can be reflected in the markers described below.98
Concentrations of specific antioxidants in body fluids are useful parts of the free radical pathology puzzle.
However, they do not indicate to what degree the body
is experiencing antioxidant damage. Laboratory procedures that challenge white cells with a pro-oxidant
and then measure changes in rates of proliferation or
radionuclide incorporation are of theoretical interest,
but no consensus exists in the scientific community that
they accurately reveal the cellular status of free radical
protection.

markers include serum or urinary malondialdehyde,
isoprostanes, 3-nitrotyrosine, methionine sulfoxide and
8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. These and other compounds will be discussed in the sections below, including the mechanism of production, current research and
routine clinical utility.

Lipid Oxidation

Membrane components are especially susceptible to
oxidative damage because they are the sites of greatest exposure to oxygen radicals and they possess high
concentrations of molecules that are easily oxidized
(unsaturated fatty acids). Cell membranes are the first
subcellular domains to encounter molecular oxygen
when it is released from hemoglobin, and mitochondrial membranes are the site where molecular oxygen is
utilized constantly for ATP production and where single
electron transfer reactions occur.

Because of the interactions between antioxidants
in cells, the critical issue is a patient’s overall capacity to
resist oxidative damage. Since cancer is associated with
free radical damage to DNA, many studies have focused
on how antioxidant status changes cancer incidence.
Although there is wide agreement that lung and breast
cancer risk is lower for individuals with higher dietary intake of multiple antioxidants, raising intake of b-carotene
only may increase risk of lung cancer, especially for
tobacco smokers.68-70
Studies that focused on single antioxidants have
reported that they have either no effect or slight negative
correlation with incidence of cancers of the lung and
breast. It may be that the various electron acceptor/donor roles of the antioxidants must be present in proportional concentrations. If any one component, such as
b-carotene, is increased dramatically, then it can become
a source of electrons for further damaging radical formation. Tests that reveal inadequacy in response to oxidant
stress can guide decisions for individual patient antioxidant supplementation.
For routine clinical assessments, it is impractical to
attempt measuring free radicals directly since they exist
for only fractions of a second. Tests that measure the
by-products of free radical pathology may provide good
indicators, though it is usually recommended that multiple oxidative product and micronutrient assessments
be used for accuracy.99 Individuals with insufficient
antioxidant protection have increased concentrations
of oxidized by-products in blood and urine.100 Such
Lipid peroxides are the products of the chemical
damage done by oxygen free radicals to the lipid component of cell membranes.101, 102 A serum lipid peroxide
level measures the overall effect of oxygen free radical
pathology, the risk of degenerative processes and the need
for compensatory antioxidant supplementation and/or
lifestyle modification. High serum lipid peroxide levels
indicate high rates for oxygen free radical lipid peroxidation. Such effects have been demonstrated by measuring
malondialdehyde (MDA) changes in obesity,103 hypertension,104 abdominal aortic aneurism,105 asthma106 and
dialysis procedures.107 A meta-analysis of multiple studies
of oxidative stress in schizophrenia published up to 2006
revealed a positive relationship.108 Other conditions where
MDA has been shown to reflect increased oxidative challenge include smoking,109 Helicobacter pylori infection,110
cystic echinococcosis111 and methamphetamine use.112
Evaluation of total lipid peroxides has proven to
be a simple, inexpensive and accurate means of reflecting whole-body free radical activity. The assay measures
malondialdehyde, a major product of lipid peroxidation,
by reaction with thiobarbituric acid (see Figure 9.5).
The fluorescent red adduct that is formed can be easily
measured. Thus, it is also known as the thiobarbituric

antioxidant capacity is inadequate to meet the oxidative
challenge, cell membrane oxidation increases, releasing
lipid peroxides.
Concentrations of lipid peroxides may be measured
in urine or serum, but serum has superior sensitivity to
slight increases in lipid peroxidation. It has gained general acceptance in the research and clinical laboratory
as a standard means of assessing the body’s antioxidant
capability and overall oxidative
stress.113, 114

In the presence of thiobarbituric acid, malondialdehyde

lends the reaction useful for quantitative measurements
that relate to oxidative damage to polyunsaturated fatty
acids of membrane and lipoproteins.

homocysteine is associated with enhanced in vivo lipid
peroxidation of LDL and high levels of isoprostane.118
Patients with hypercholesterolemia show increased levels
of isoprostanes.119 Frequent alcohol consumption also
causes elevated isoprostanes.120
Recent in vitro observations show the potential for
formation of extremely reactive products of the isoprostane pathway. They rapidly form covalent adducts with
lysine residues on proteins, which may cause enzyme
inactivation or formation of antigenic macromolecules.
Such reactions provide one mechanism of loss of tissue
function from oxidative damage.121 Isoprostane excretion has been used to monitor disease progression and
improvement with ethanol abstinence in patients with
alcoholic liver disease.122 The marker is also an indicator
of amyloid beta-peptide-induced oxidative damage in
Alzheimer’s disease.123 Zinc protects against the toxicity
of beta-amyloid peptide.124 Both L-arginine and alphatocopherol reduce urinary isoprostane excretion and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, although
by different mechanisms.125 The instability of isoprostanes makes their measurement at remote laboratories
inaccurate due to specimen transport requirements.

Isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds

to the activation of the clotting system.116 Quantitation
of F2-IsoP in various body fluids is clearly established as
a superior way of assessing oxidative stress.117 Accumulation of isoprostanes may mediate the atherosclerotic

An aldehyde product of lipid peroxidation,
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) produces a range of powerful biological effects. It is a highly mutagenic and genotoxic product generated during oxidative stress. HNE
acts as a part of the signaling pathway in the cellular
response to oxidative stress by inducing gene expression
of cyclooxygenase 2, which causes increased synthesis of
prostaglandins and thromboxanes.126
Congestive heart failure is one state of oxidative
stress in which HNE is consistently elevated.127 Aortic
endothelial cells display dose-dependent inhibition
of nitric oxide formation by HNE that is mediated by
lowered tetrahydrobiopterin levels.128 This effect is an illustration of how oxidative stress can alter BH4 status, as
described in Chapter 1, “Vitamins.” Hyperglycemic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, present another state
of HNE elevation. The insulin-releasing response of pancreatic islet cells is inhibited by HNE. The oxidative state

Evidence implicating oxidation products in lipoprotein particles (OxLDL) with atherogenesis is increasing.142, 143 Advanced stages of lesions show increase of
OxLDL that may associate with adaptive immunity.144
Such a mechanism may explain the antiatherogenic
effects of antioxidants, which can reduce the oxidation
rate of LDL.145-147 The ensuing immune response against
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may have a
protective role in the early stages of atherogenesis,148
but this same immune response may be a trigger for setting in motion the cascade of events that culminates in
advanced atherosclerotic lesions.149 Changes in age-related immune parameters are also mediated by oxidized
cholesterol.150
The endothelial cells are constantly challenged
to resist oxidative damage. The largest source of this
challenge is oxidized plasma lipoprotein components
containing oxidized fatty acids and cholesterol.151
Cholesterol is easily oxidized to cholest-4-en-3-one.
This and other partial oxidation products accumulate in
lipoprotein particles where they are presented to the luminal surface of endothelial cells. Lipid hydroperoxides
in plasma, for example, are carried almost exclusively
(89%) in LDL. In 70 patients tested 3 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, plasma lipid hydroperoxide levels were significantly increased when compared
with matched healthy controls,152 providing further
evidence linking oxidative damage and heart disease.
Generally, the assay of oxidized LDL is performed
on lipids extracted from plasma on Liposorb gel. Results
should be less than 2.5 nmol/mL. A related assay measures a subpopulation of LDL particles with relatively
high density. Individuals with elevated levels of this variety of LDL are at high risk of heart disease even if their
total LDL concentration is not high.153 The two phenomena discussed here may be linked because oxidized
cholesterol may accumulate in “small, dense” LDL. The
LDL subfractions are measured by analytical ultracentrifugation or electrophoresis of serum lipoproteins.

stimulated by hyperglycemia causes further inhibition
of the normal glucose-lowering response with a “feedforward” (self-propagating) effect. This linkage explains
the action of lipoic acid as an antioxidant in improving insulin response.129, 130 A similar antioxidant role of
phenolic compounds from olive oil is associated with
lowered HNE production in cancer patients and patients
with inflammatory bowel conditions such as ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease.131 The fecal matrix supports
abundant generation of ROS, and high HNE levels are
generated in the colonic mucosa of these patients. In
neurodegenerative disease, elevated HNE reflects the
destructive cycle of oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction.132, 133 High HNE in Alzheimer’s disease
provides evidence of oxidative stress-induced pathology
in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles.134
HNE reacts rapidly with DNA to form substituted
adducts.135 Such DNA adducts to HNE are elevated in
patients with Wilson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.136
The accumulation of copper and iron in this disease
leads to increased oxidative damage and high risk of
primary liver cancers. Such adducts are also greatly
increased in humans placed on diets high in omega-6
polyunsaturated fatty acids without adequate antioxidant protection.137 Thus, HNE and its DNA adducts are
promising biomarkers for monitoring effects of dietary
fat intake, oxidative stress and antioxidant protection.
Lowered HNE also reveals an important aspect of positive health benefits from calorie-restricted diets.138
Plasma HNE, thus, is a marker of the progenitor
effects in many diseases and, conversely, can be used to
forecast wellness. The clearance of HNE requires biotransformation via omega oxidation of the aldehyde139
and conjugation with glutathione to give excretion of a
mercaptan derivative.140 Because of the high reactivity of
HNE with proteins, the measurement of protein adducts
is more indicative than that obtained by attempting to
measure HNE directly, even in research situations.141

The surface of proteins tends to contain abundant
amino acid side chains that can undergo oxidation.
Two of the most well-recognized products are nitrotyrosine and methionine sulfoxide, arising from reaction
of nitric oxide and ROS with tyrosine and methionine,
respectively. These protein modifications do not necessarily lead to loss of function, but they generally signal
cathepsins to degrade the modified proteins, releasing
the altered amino acids.
The retina has special need for oxidative damage
protection because of the free radical-generating effects
of ultraviolet radiation. Soluble retinal proteins induce
nitric oxide and superoxide production by macrophages.
Increased production of ROS by macrophages in the
presence of these soluble retinal proteins in vivo may
accelerate photoreceptor degeneration.154, 155 Vitamin E

The reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide yields the
very reactive peroxynitrite radical. Exposed tyrosine
residues on proteins are susceptible to attack by
peroxynitrite, resulting in stable polypeptide-bound
3-nitrotyrosine residues. Subsequent hydrolysis releases
nitrotyrosine as a free amino acid.

3-nitrotyrosine can provide insight about which
patients need antioxidant supplementation to prevent
oxidative damage.
Clinical Relevance. Premature infants are susceptible
to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung
disease of infancy. The disease appears to be caused
in part by oxidative stress from hyperoxia. Plasma
3-nitrotyrosine concentrations are significantly higher
in infants with BPD, increasing approximately fourfold
during the first month of life and correlating with the
fraction of inspired oxygen that the infant receives.165
Peroxynitrite-mediated oxidant stress may contribute
to the development of this disease in premature infants, and 3-nitrotyrosine is useful as an early plasma
indicator of infants at risk of developing BPD. Through
similar mechanisms, the oxidative stress that leads to
most degenerative diseases is associated with increased
3-nitrotyrosine production. When iron deficiency is
induced in weanling rats, protein tyrosine nitration was
increased, along with ventricular dilation and mitochondrial cytochrome-c release.166
Nitrotyrosine formation increases with endotoxininduced kidney, injury suggesting that protein nitration
may participate in renal regulation and in renal injury.167
The concentration of 3-nitrotyrosine found in patients
with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was approximately seven times that of controls.168

While it is important to produce adequate nitric
oxide (NO), when nitric oxide is present in the face
of oxidant stress, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a “reactive
nitrogen species” (RNS), can be formed. Peroxynitrite
is formed by combination of superoxide (O2) and NO
radicals (Figure 9.6). Peroxynitrite is being increasingly
proposed as a contributor to tissue injury in several human diseases.157-164
Tyrosine residues in proteins are nitrated by peroxynitrite, forming 3-nitrotyrosine. Nitrotyrosine formation takes place in proteins that are present in nitric
oxide-stimulated cells such as endolthelium. Nitration of
the tyrosine residues in proteins leads to changes of protein structure and function. The proteins are degraded
at cell death to release the 3-nitrotyrosine residues that
then will circulate in blood plasma.
The evidence presented for peroxynitrite partici­
pation usually includes the demonstration of increased
3-nitrotyrosine levels in the injured tissue. Increase
in 3-nitrotyrosine, therefore, reflects increases in
nitric oxide and superoxide production. Evaluation of

Methionine sulfoxide (MetO) is a marker of cellular
oxidative stress, specifically involving enzymes and
structural proteins because it is formed from methionine
residues that are exposed on protein surfaces. Elevated
MetO levels indicate inadequate overall antioxidant
protection. Alteration of Met to MetO may be reversed
by the methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes.174
These enzymes, called peptide methionine sulfoxide
reductases (PMSR), are involved in the resistance of
mammalian cells to oxidative stress.175 MetO has been
shown to cause enzyme inactivation.176 It accumulates

acid has specific antioxidant properties and may exert
a curative effect in diseases accompanied by oxidative
stress by stimulating the methionine sulfoxide reductase
enzyme.180 In blood, methionine sulfoxide appears along
with oxidized cholesterol as the process of oxidative
damage acts on blood lipoproteins.181
Nutrient effects may extend to reversing, as well
as preventing, oxidant damage. Oxidative damage to
the protein alpha-1-antiprotease (alpha-1-AP) occurs
with formation of 3-nitrotyrosine residues.182 Oxidized
alpha-1-AP has been implicated in the etiology of lung
diseases. Repair of oxidized alpha 1-AP is catalyzed
by PMSR, which is activated by dihydrolipoic acid to
reverse oxidative damage to the damaged alpha-1-AP.180
Thus, there is the potential to use methionine sulfoxide
to monitor not only oxidative stress at the biochemical level, but also to demonstrate reversal of oxidative
damage by lipoic acid. If the damage is detected early
enough, reversing oxidative damage to proteins can
reverse disease. However, a potentially detrimental role
of excessive alpha-tocopherol is the enhancement of
HDL oxidation in vitro, with more rapid appearance of
methionine sulfoxide residues when isolated HDL was
enriched with alpha-tocopherol.181

damage because of up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide
synthetase (iNOS) expression, and thereby radical nitrogen species, in the gastric mucosa. Nitrotyrosine in the
gastric mucosa is also significantly higher in H. pyloripositive groups than in H. pylori-negative individuals.170
In laboratory animals, iNOS expression and NO
synthesis in macrophages and cardiomyocytes are
elicited in experimental inflammatory heart disease.171
Similarly, in inflammatory bowel disease, epithelial cells
and immune cells that are producing reactive oxygen species display induction of iNOS and increased
3-nitrotyrosine.172
We may conclude that patients with elevated nitrotyrosine are in a state of oxidative stress. Arginine supplementation is contraindicated, and, since antioxidant
status is compromised, general support with antioxidant
nutrients is indicated. Antioxidant nutrients, including
the polyphenolic compounds abundant in tea,173 offer

The rate of oxidative DNA damage may be
estimated by measuring 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine
(8-OHdG), also written as the tautomer, 8-oxoguanosine
(8-oxodG). 8-OHdG is a repair product of the highly
mutagenic oxidation of guanine in DNA or the cellular
pool of GTP, from a 24-hour urine collection. Bus
drivers from Copenhagen showed increased 8-OHdG
compared with drivers from rural/suburban greater
Copenhagen, which suggests that exposure to ambient
air pollution can cause oxidative damage to DNA.183
Exposure to ultraviolet light and benzo[a]pyrene can

test arises from the fact that serum components such as
albumin and uric acid that are present at high concentrations make major contributions to the resistance
against oxidation. Their contributions are so great that
they obscure the more important factors (such as ascorbate and vitamin E) that are major factors for protection
in subcellular compartments. The use of ORAC to detect
susceptibility to human disease has been disappointing
because of the lack of discrimination among healthy
and diseased individuals. The lack of sensitivity results
in serum from a range of normal individuals having
ORAC values very similar to those from diabetics, cancer
patients and HIV-infected individuals.195

known as Eales disease had increased 8-OHdG that
correlated with decreased SOD activity and decreased
glutathione status.185
The intracellular antioxidants glutathione and
ascorbate can protect human lymphocytes against oxidative DNA damage. The antioxidant levels are negatively correlated with the levels of oxidative lymphocyte
DNA damage, and the strongest correlation observed is
with glutathione.186 Even among populations that might
be considered normal, increasing intake of antioxidant vitamins with a nutrient-rich supplement reduces
8-OHdG by 22% compared with unsupplemented
adults.187 8-OHdG also increases with high-fat diets,
showing the hyperoxidative response associated with
excessive fat intake.183 Age-associated decline in mitochondrial function due to mitochondrial DNA damage
is indicated by the finding of increased 8-OHdG with
age in laboratory animals.188

## p-Hydroxyphenyllactate

p-Hydroxyphenyllactate (HPLA) may be reported
in urinary organic acid profiles. A discussion of its role
as a marker of increased oxidative status is presented
in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” The compound offers a
unique view of the regulation of endogenous auto-oxidation processes. Unlike other markers that show how
much challenge can be tolerated or how much damage has occurred, HPLA reveals how much challenge
is being generated within the tissues. Individuals with
elevated p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, a carcinogenic
tyrosine metabolite, tend to have decreased ascorbic acid
(vitamin C) in liver, adrenal glands and blood.196 HGA
causes oxidation of hemoglobin that is altered by the
presence of SOD and catalase.197

## DNA Strand Breakage (Comet Assay)

Refer to Case Illustration 9.1

One of the ultimate damaging consequences of
oxidative challenge is damage to DNA. Such damage
may be measured directly by looking for breaks in DNA
strands as revealed on single-cell (WBC) gel electrophoresis in the Comet assay.189 This assay measures DNA
damage, particularly DNA strand breakage. It has been
used to measure the oxidative damage resulting from
iron overload in thalassemia.190 The test provides a rapid
measure for biomonitoring occupational exposure to
DNA-damaging agents.191

Oxygen Radical
Absorption Capacity
Although the oxygen radical absorbent capacity
(ORAC) test has been offered by some laboratories for
assessment of serum antioxidant capacity, it is largely of
value in studies of antioxidant capacities of foods. When
serum is challenged with a chemical oxidant, the time
course of resistance to protein destruction is a measure
of the body’s total ability to resist the oxidative challenge.192, 193 The test is useful for assessing antioxidant
capacities of foods and for comparative antioxidant

Homogentisate
Some aspects of the oxidative stress associated
with elevated homogentisate (HGA) were discussed in
Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” Early knowledge about the
effects of homogentisate elevation came from examination of patients with alkaptonuria. The progressive
buildup of oxidation products in these patients results in
the adverse pigmentation, calcification and inflammation
of cartilagenous tissue called ochronosis. Administration of ascorbic acid (500 mg, BID) resulted in clinical
improvement in 1 of 3 siblings with alkaptonuria.198
The oxidation products, called plasma soluble melanins (PSM), are formed by copolymerization of dopa,
catecholamines, homogentisic acid and other polyhydroxy

Production of ROS is one result of host pathogen
interactions following invasion. Neutrophil-mediated
oxidative burst is a well-understood antimicrobial
mechanism. The mechanism involves the rapid generation and release of reactive oxygen intermediates by
the NADPH oxidase complex.202 Increased oxidative
stress has been shown to be associated with infection
with a broad spectrum of infectious organisms, including Helicobacter pylori,203, 204 Prevotella intermedia205 and
Brucella melitensis.206 Another benefit to the host of
increased ROS formation is the induction of apoptosis in
the infected cells that significantly imparts protection to
the host from the pathogen.207
The ability of some pathogens such as the
Cryptospordium parvum to survive the PMN oxidative
burst offers an explanation of their persistent invasiveness. Oocysts of C. parvum may persist within macrophage phagosomes for up to a week.208 Improving
antioxidant status may produce more effective oxidative
burst in response to infection. Subjects who were given
dietary supplements containing 18 mg beta-carotene,
900 mg vitamin C and 90 mg vitamin E for 7 days
prior to a 2-hour treadmill run at 65% VO2max had

significantly higher oxidative burst activity than controls.209 Also, children with recurrent upper respiratory
disease and asthma who were given reduced glutathione, L-cysteine and anthocyane (a dietary flavonoid)
showed elevation of interferon-gamma production, lymphocyte response to mitogens and NK cell activity, along
with long-term improvement in clinical status.53
Pathogen responses also can generate additional
oxidative stress for host cells. The global gene expression
profile of Shigella flexneri following infection of human
epithelial and macrophage cell lines suggests that ROS
protection mechanisms are involved in survival and
growth strategies of Shigella in the human host.210 The
facultative intracellular pathogen Penicillium marneffei
that causes common opportunistic infection in AIDS
patients displays highly inducible expression of genes
for catalase-peroxidases.211 Invasion mechanisms
used by the yeasts Candida albicans and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae involve collection of sphingolipids and sterols
into lipid rafts in the cell membranes. The antioxidant
virulence factor Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is
concentrated six- to ninefold in raft membrane fractions
compared with non-raft membranes.212 These are some
of the responses involving oxidative challenge produced
by both host and pathogen during infection. Patients
with histories of chronic infection are at higher risk of
antioxidant insufficiency.213, 214 Numerous studies have
reported favorable patient responses to antioxidants following infectious diseases.215-219

compounds. Antioxidants delay the formation of PSM
that contribute to the yellow color of plasma and urine.
Formation of PSM is found in pheochromocytoma and
Parkinson’s syndromes, in addition to alkaptonuria.
Drugs such as the antihypertensive alpha-methyldopa
that causes Parkinson’s syndrome also can contribute to
the formation of PSM.199 Mechanisms other that PSM
formation may add to the oxidative stress from HGA
elevation.
In order to investigate the origin of metabolic lesions found in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT), 22
patients and 11 controls were challenged with 50 mg/kg
HGA. The much greater elevation of serum HGA in
subjects 1 hour after loading (30 vs. 19 µg/mL) suggested a mechanism of glutathione adduct formation by
HGA degradation products that is exacerbated by the
metabolic lesion in HT.200 Similar effects in alkaptonuria
or idiopathic HGA elevation may help explain the severe
oxidative stress effects associated with HGA elevation.
In the presence of copper, HGA causes DNA damage, as
shown by increased production of 8-OHdG. Formation
of a Cu(I)-peroxide complex due to the presence of HGA
is thought to produce the DNA oxidative damage.201

## Treatment Options
In the case of markers of oxidant damage, the
lower the test result level, the better. However, since
free radicals are produced in the normal processes of
metabolism, the body can tolerate a certain level without
significant health risk.
Treatment of patients with elevated oxidative damage markers involves the twofold approach of reducing
exposure to free radical-generating agents and increasing
antioxidant levels in the body.

Reduce Pro-Oxidants
It is clear that environmental agents increase free
radical activity. The oxidative stress associated with
elevated body burdens of toxic elements such as cadmium was discussed in Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic

Elements.” The toxicity of pesticides, ionizing radiation
and cigarette smoke also may be due to their free radical
initiating ability. Lifestyle factors such as stress, heavy
exercise, smoking, excess alcohol and infections tend to
raise lipid peroxide levels.
The body burden of pro-oxidant compounds may
be lowered by reducing exposure and increasing removal or detoxification. Individuals who may have greatly
increased pro-oxidant responses to even slight xenobiotic exposures must take extra measures to lower environmental levels. Other sources provide more details about
how to manage environmentally sensitive patients.220

because it has no specific free radical scavenging cofactor
role. However, when implementing overall oxidant reduction strategies, magnesium status must be assured.

## Other Lifestyle Factors

Sleep disorders interfere with normal tissue restoration and hormonal control patterns. The pineal hormone
melatonin, in addition to its role as functional regulator
of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal system, is a highly
efficient free radical scavenger and general antioxidant.223 It is roughly twice as effective as vitamin E for
protection against the peroxyl radical. Regular adequate
sleep is the major controlling factor in maintaining adequate levels of melatonin.

Notes:

If oxidative damage markers are high, supplementation of natural antioxidants is indicated. These include
vitamins A, C and E; beta-carotene; selenium; coenzyme
Q10; taurine; B2; B3 and certain bioflavonoids.55 Balanced
intake of all of the antioxidants is superior to individual
supplementation because of the demonstrated codependence of antioxidant reaction sequences. In this regard,
it is worth considering the use of botanical sources of
antioxidants such as Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng or
other rich sources of complex mixtures of polyphenols
with antioxidant vitamins.221
Magnesium deficiency can increase oxidant loads
because of its effect of increasing stress responses.222 Magnesium was not included above as an antioxidant nutrient

in the absence of key measurements. Once the nature of
the oxidative stress problem was identified, aggressive

This case illustrates a patient with a severe, long-standing
chronic condition that defies standard diagnosis. The

evaluation. Even with multiple metabolic and stool profile
