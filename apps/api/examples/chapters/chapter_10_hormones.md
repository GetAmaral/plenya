Notes:

Because of their complex interactions, hormones
are not easily ordered into a sequential presentation.
The adopted approach favors a quasi-life-cycle topical
organization of growth, maintenance and reproduction.
The main endocrine hormones are discussed under the
headings of “Growth and Homeostasis,” “The Stress
Response,” and “The Sex Hormones.” Each section introduces concepts of master-gland control followed by discussions of hormone function and clinical assessment.
Specific hormone coverage is followed by aspects of test
selection, hormone delivery, bioidentical hormone therapy and hormonal biotransformation. The final section of
the chapter briefly touches on some other mechanisms
of cell control, concluding with the example of cytokine
activity in the AKT signaling pathway for apoptosis.
The endocrine system has historically been defined
as consisting of eight primary organs: pituitary, thyroid,
thymus, adrenal, pancreas, pineal, ovary and testes.
Hormonal synthesis and release also takes place in other
organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, heart, liver
and placenta. A web-like interplay of hormones works
to maintain physiological homeostasis as part of the total
neuroimmunohormonal regulation of the body. Classic

endocrinology is concerned with long-range interactions
in which chemical messengers produced in one organ
exert control on specific target tissues outside of the site
of synthesis. The full spectrum of cellular controls also
includes paracrine and autocrine signal molecules that
exert control on nearby cells or the same cell in which
they were produced. Examples of these include eicosanoids (see Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids”) and nitric oxide
(see Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”).
A brief discussion of other levels of cell controls
and the details of a representative cytokine-stimulated
phosphorylation pathway is included at that end of this
chapter. Some hormones are able to behave in both
a paracrine and an autocrine fashion. For example,
testosterone, which is produced in the Leydig cells of
the testes, can stimulate nearby spermatogenesis as well
as distant target organ responses. Hormones that act on
distant target tissue cells are released in greater quantities than are paracrine or autocrine signal molecules, and
hormone half-lives vary from milliseconds to days. Those
released in the greatest quantity are epinephrine, cortisol
and insulin. Some of the most important hormones are
regulated by the hypothalamus and pituitary and include
growth, steroid, thyroid and stress hormones.

Evaluation of hormones and other cell regulators
is a growing area of laboratory science. The catalog of
one specialty laboratory lists over 350 separate single
hormones or multiple hormone profiles.1 Well over 100
direct hormone and challenge response tests are available for gastrointestinal hormones alone. Endocrinology
is an ever-evolving field, where the elucidation of cell
differentiation and regulation has led to an expansion of
knowledge about the rapidly growing list of compounds
used for cellular communication. We will confine our
discussion primarily to the tests that are most commonly
utilized by the integrative medical practitioner.

The output of hormones in response to physiological stresses can impact the demands for specific nutrients, as summarized in Table 10.1. Thus, laboratory
assessment of hormones is pertinent to the practice of
nutritional medicine because the hormonal influences on
metabolism alter nutrient demands. Hormones can also
have direct effects on nutrient availability. For example,
thyroxine is involved in the conversion of beta-carotene
to vitamin A. Abnormal levels of vitamin A have been
found in hyper- and hypothyroidism.2, 3 Hyperthyroidism has also been shown to cause increased utilization
of coenzyme Q10 in children, due to increased electron

transport-chain activity.4 Vitamins C and E have also
been shown to be deficient in the hyperthyroid state.5
Not only do hormone actions alter nutrient status,
but also hormone production can be altered by nutrient
deficiencies because of their actions on enzyme activities
and gene expression.6 Some of these relationships are
summarized in Table 10.2. Nutrients are known to play
a significant role in modulating the formation, clearance
and tissue responses to hormones. Nutritional adequacy
is thus a prerequisite to appropriate hormonal function.
Returning to the example of thyroid function, selenium
and zinc are both cofactors in key thyroid enzymes, and
have been shown to be abnormal in various thyroid conditions. Iodine deficiency has long been recognized as a
cause of goiter due to excessive thyroid stimulation in an
attempt to synthesize thyroxine (see Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements”).7
Hormones may be classified by their structural
similarities. For example, cholesterol provides the starting material for the steroid hormones, including the
reproductive hormones as well as cortisol, DHEA and aldosterone. When cholesterol levels are lowered, as with
statin drugs, effects of reduced precursor concentrations
on production of these hormones may explain increases
in risks of depression, impulsive behavior and suicides.8
Via multiple hormone-hormone interactions, such effects
can spread to other structural classes, such as the tyrosine-derived catecholamines, dopamine and homovanilate, that may rise with decreased serum cholesterol.9

the body via protein synthesis and fat breakdown. GH
stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor-I
(IGF-I), also known as somatomedin C, which is produced primarily by the liver as an endocrine hormone.

Rates of hormone synthesis and release are regulated by the hypothalamus. Neuronal-level control
governs secretion of releasing factors that travel from the
hypothalamus to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland,
causing release of hormones that stimulate specific endocrine glands that, in turn, secrete hormones for stimulation of target tissue responses as illustrated for the
stress response in Figure 10.1. Through its hormones,
the hypothalamus plays a major role in the control of
metabolic activity throughout the body, including basic
functions such as hunger, thirst, body heat and sleep.
Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), also
known as somatocrinin, is carried by the hypothalamohypophysial portal circulation to the anterior lobe of the
pituitary gland, where it stimulates secretion of growth
hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin. GHRH and
GH are both released in pulses. GH promotes growth of

Functions: The principal effect of GH is to stimulate the liver and other tissues to synthesize IGF-I.10
Thus, IGF-I mediates the action of growth hormone.
The levels of IGF-I, unlike growth hormone, are relatively constant during the day, making its measurement
more reliable. The greater stability of serum IGF-I is due
in part to the buffering action of IGF-binding protein
that is also present in serum. The presence of a binding
protein raises the question of whether bound, free or
total forms should be measured. Salivary IGF-I levels
measure the active, free form and reflect the GH status
of the patient.11 The concentrations of serum IGF-I
are low at birth (< 100 ng/mL) and rise steeply during childhood and puberty, reaching values as high as

Responses to Stress

The hypothalamic, pituitary and adrenal glands respond
in tandem to elicit multiple tissue responses when stress
signals are received. When the brain perceives the removal
of the threat, then the initiating neuronal signals subside
and the system returns to basal levels of activity.

Clinical Assessment: Excessive production of GH
causes gigantism, acromegaly or other malformations.
Deficient production of GH has differing effects depending on when in a person’s development the deficiency
begins. In young children, a deficiency of GH results in
growth failure that can be dramatically relieved if GH is
given before puberty. In adults, a GH deficiency is associated with metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, muscle
wasting, impaired quality of life and increased incidence of cardiovascular events.15 GH response has been
found to be negatively correlated with body mass index,
increasing age and, in the absence of additional pituitary
hormone deficits, hypothalamic-pituitary disease.16, 17
GH has been successfully used in reducing cholesterol,18,19 body fat,20 blood pressure, and anxiety, and in
increasing lean muscle,21 bone density, HDL, and energy
levels.22 The diagnosis of adult GH deficiency (GHD) often includes the addition of provocative testing, such as
the insulin tolerance test, the arginine test or the GHRH-

arginine test, although clinical signs and symptoms must
be included in the evaluation.16, 23 IGF-I may not be as
sensitive a marker in adult onset GHD.17 The evidence
for partial deficiency of GH, also referred to as GH
insufficiency (GHI) is increasing. Some researchers have
noted that the condition may be more common in adults
with concurrent hypothalamic-pituitary disease.17 Signs
often associated with GHI are abnormal body composition, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance.23
Several factors have been identified to explain improvements of tissue function in aged animals resulting
from administration of GH. Individual differences in
IGF-I synthesis are significant. Dose titration to the upper-normal mid-life range reduces the incidence of side
effects and GH insensitivity. Women have lower sensitivities than age-matched men and are likely to require
slightly higher doses of GH. Starvation, cachexia, hyperalimentation and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
are associated with functional GH resistance in which,
despite normal or high GH levels, circulatory IGF-I
levels are low. In such conditions, human recombinant
IGF-I is available for direct intravenous or subcutaneous
administration,24 but doses must be adjusted carefully
to avoid side effects. Caloric restriction induces moderate endocrine compensatory mechanisms, including
increased GH and decreased IGF-I. It has been proposed
that the decline in pathologies and increased life span
observed in caloric restriction result from these changes
causing decreased stimulus for cellular replication.25
Plasma amino acid concentrations reflect changes in
amino acid metabolism associated with changes in IGF-I
and IGF-binding protein levels. In rats, lower dietary
protein intake and lower plasma EAA/NEAA ratios were
associated with lower IGF-I.26 Arginine functions as
a secretagogue in its ability to stimulate the release of
growth hormone and subsequently raise IGF-1 levels.27,
In a study of 8 adult men, arginine supplementation
stimulated GH release, though to a lesser degree than
seen with exercise alone. The greatest GH release was
from the combined effect of arginine administration
before exercise.29 GH administration to older adults has
also shown to increase exercise capacity.30
GH is involved in lipid metabolism.31 A negative feedback loop between plasma free fatty acids and
growth hormone has been suggested.32 Research studies
have found decreased free fatty acids have been shown
to result in an increase of growth hormones,32 whereas
free fatty acid elevations inhibited GH secretion.33

1,000 ng/mL by age 15. Levels generally begin to fall by
the mid-twenties, and they continue to decline thereafter.10,12 Although the absence of GH and IGF-I may
contribute to the phenotype of aging, increased IGF-I
is an important risk factor in age-related pathologies,
including lung, breast and prostate cancer. This apparent contradiction raises the question of whether levels
of these hormones change in response to other factors
as a way of normalizing physiological stressors. Growth
hormone has recently been recognized for its powerful
endothelium-dependent effects as well. Studies looking at endothelial function in the aged versus the young
showed an increase in aortic media thickness with age,
which resulted in a decreased vasodilatory response.
When GH was given, vasodilatory response improved
and reduced media thickness. GH also appears to restore
amino acid status in animal studies. In older rats, an
increase in glutamine, arginine and aspartate were noted
with an increase in citrulline. GH treatment restored
amino acids to levels of those in young rats.13,14

Metabolic Effects

Increases osteoblastic expression
of osteocalcin and alkaline
phosphatase mRNA

TRH, also called thyrotropin-releasing factor, is
secreted from the hypothalamus and stimulates the
anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin. TSH stimulates the release
of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland, located in
the neck. Thyroid hormones contain two aromatic rings
of tyrosine linked together with the addition of iodine.
The addition of iodine at three places makes T3 (triiodothyronine), the addition of four iodine atoms makes T4
(thyroxine/tetraiodothyronine) as previously illustrated
in Figure 3.13 of Chapter 3.
Functions: Primary functions of thyroid hormones include controlling basal metabolic rate; protein
synthesis; regulation of protein, fat and carbohydrate
metabolism; and increasing the body’s sensitivity to
catecholamines (such as adrenaline). The gene-stimulating ability of thyroxine is demonstrated by the increased
production of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase
mRNA in osteoblasts from femur.47 In the liver, thyroxine sustains the transcriptional rate for production of
cytochrome-c apoproteins.48 The thyroid gland utilizes
iodine in combination with tyrosine to produce the
thyroid hormones T4 and T3 (T1 and T2 are also synthesized), which are then released into the bloodstream
and regulate metabolism (see the section “Iodine” in
Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements”).
T4 is a hormone with diminished biological activity
relative to T3. It is converted into T3, the form that performs most of the thyroid function in the body. Generally, there is significantly more T4 (80%) than T3 (20%).

Other Relationships and Effects: GH treatment
reduced postmenopausal osteoporosis by up-regulation
of intestinal vitamin D receptors, in a manner similar to
the action of estrogen.34 In a case-control study that compared healthy control subjects with GH-deficient participants, compared with GH-deficient females, GH-deficient
males were found to have significantly reduced bone
mineral density and bone mineral content. The authors
suggest that females are able to compensate for the lack
of GH via estrogen substitution, an effect testosterone
does not seem to possess.35 Both GH and IGF-I have been
shown to modulate renal vitamin D through regulation
of inorganic phosphate balance.36 Low IGF-I will also decrease carboxylated osteocalcin synthesis. This decrease
will result in a lack of bone mass mineralization. In a
10-year study of 87 adults with GHD, GH replacement
induced a sustained increase in bone mass and bone
density.37 Vitamin K is indicated in patients with a low
IGF-I because it has been shown to increase carboxylated
osteocalcin and, therefore, improve bone mass.38 Zinc
also modulates IGF-I. Zinc links to a peptide hormone
cell-service receptor to form a complex that stimulates
mRNA synthesis and gene expression for IGF-I.39 In HIV
patients, acetyl-l-carnitine at 3g/d for 5 months resulted
in an increased IGF-I level and a concomitant decrease in
lymphocytic apoptosis.40 Omega-3 fatty acids up-regulate
IGF-I activity in bone and should also be considered
when IGF-I levels are low.41 Since IGF-I potentiates uptake of magnesium into red blood cells,42 low red blood
cell magnesium may be related to low IGF-I levels. A
direct correlation between deficient levels of vitamin A
and both 24-hour GH output and IGF-binding protein
was found in short, slowly growing children.43 Dietary
conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) increases serum IGF-I and
IGF-binding protein concentrations and reduces bone
formation in rats fed n-6 or n-3 fatty acids.44 This observation suggests adjunctive use of IGF-I in cases where
CLA is used for reduction of body fat.45
When considering hormonal dysfunction, toxicity—
primarily heavy metals—should always be ruled out.
Heavy metals are stored in fat; therefore, the fatty nature
of glandular tissue makes endocrine glands particularly
susceptible to toxicity. High levels of lead in children’s
blood can hinder their growth. Children with the highest
levels of lead had the lowest levels of IGF-I, and after each
chelation treatment, a rapid growth spurt occurred.46

Clinical Assessment: The most common thyroid
dysfunction is hypothyroidism. Table 10.3 summarizes
signs and symptoms of hypo- and hyperthyroidism.
There are several forms of hypothyroidism, which are
generally referred to as being primary, secondary and
tertiary. Primary hypothyroidism is due to a decreased
production of T3 and T4 at the level of the thyroid gland
itself. Primary hypothyroidism can result from a dietary
deficiency of iodine or impaired iodine uptake by the
thyroid gland. Primary hypothyroidism can also occur
as a result of autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue.
Autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue is often referred to as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In the United States,
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of
primary hypothyroidism, whereas worldwide, iodine
deficiency is the most common etiology of primary
hypothyroidism.49 Secondary hypothyroidism refers
to inadequate stimulation of the thyroid to produce
thyroid hormone as a result of insufficient TSH due to
pituitary dysfunction. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs far less frequently than primary hypothyroidism.
Tertiary hypothyroidism occurs as a result of hypothalamic dysfunction, wherein decreased release of the
TRH results in inadequate TSH release.50 Secondary and
tertiary hypothyroidisms are frequently associated with
tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus. Functional

hypothyroidism displays decreased T3 with normal TSH
and T4, secondary to decreased conversion of T4 to T3
in peripheral tissues. Reasons for decreased conversion
include increased conversion to reverse T3 or selenium
deficiency. Reverse T3 is an isomer of T3 that is made
under conditions of stress and has little to no bioactivity.
Thyroid hormone evaluation was one of the first assessments to be routinely done in the clinical laboratory.
Protein-bound iodine (PBI) analysis was replaced by T4,
followed by thyroid profiles of free and bound T4 along
with the metabolites T3 and TSH. Calculated values of
T3 uptake and free thyroxine index have been added to
improve discrimination of primary thyroid disorders and
conditions that stimulate the synthesis of serum thyroid-binding proteins. In examining laboratory reports,
it is important to differentiate total T4 and free T4. The
total T4 test has been used for many years. Its drawback
is that it can be affected by interference, such as the
amount of protein in the blood. Free T4 is the active
form of thyroxine and is not affected by protein levels.
Upper reference limits for serum TSH steadily declined during the first 20 years after introduction of the
test. Initial values of approximately 10 declined to 4.0 to
4.5 mIU/L prior to the year 2000. In its recent guidelines, the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry
(NACB) recommended 2.5 mIU/L as a reference level for
serum TSH. This was done because reference populations, on which the definition of the reference range is
based, contain persons undergoing an initial phase of
autoimmune thyroid disease. Primary hypothyroidism is
characterized by low or low-normal levels of T4 and T3,
and high TSH. Primary hypothyroidism affects the entire

T3 and T4 participate in a negative feedback loop; when
levels are low, the pituitary gland produces TSH, and the
TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more T3
and T4. When the levels of T3 and T4 rise, the pituitary
decreases TSH production.

tyrosine are indicators that corroborate tyrosine limitation for T4 synthesis.
Thyroid hormone displays complex interactions
with other hormones. Schmidt’s syndrome involves concurrent autoimmune thyroiditis and Addison’s disease.
Although this occurs in a relatively small percent of the
population with a thyroid condition, variants of this may
be more common. When treating a thyroid condition,
the adrenals must also be considered. Addison’s patients
may have a higher occurrence of hypothyroidism.59, 60 In
someone with autoimmune thyroiditis, giving cortisol
has been shown to lower titers of antithyroid antibodies.61 Improvements in adrenal function may therefore
facilitate improvement in thyroid function and improve
glucose tolerance. Increased 16-hydroxyestrogen activity
compared with 2-hydroxyestrogen has also been associated with proliferative thyroid disease.62
Physiological responses to circulating T4 depend on
its peripheral conversion to T3 by enzymes that require
selenium.63 Patients with normal circulating hormone
levels who display clinical hypothyroid symptoms may
be selenium depleted. Thyroid function is particularly
dependent on essential element status. Single and
multiple deficiencies of selenium, zinc and iodine have
distinct effects on thyroid metabolism and structure.64–66
Zinc supplementation was found to favorably effect
thyroid hormone levels, particularly total T3.65 Human
populations have developed Keshan disease, KashinBek disease and hypothyroid cretinism when they’ve
become deficient in iodine and selenium simultaneously.67 Adequate dietary supply of iodine is essential for
proper thyroid function. High blood levels of fatty acids

body, mentally and physically, so symptoms can vary
significantly. Thus, it is important to also use clinical
judgment, patient history and symptoms, and physical
exam when making a final evaluation of thyroid status.
Many clinicians agree that measuring TSH alone is not
adequate to rule out thyroid dysfunction. In addition
to a TSH, running a free T3, the most biologically active
form of the hormones, alongside a free T4, will give a
better understanding of activity. In early hypothyroidism, the level of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) may
be normal. Additionally, it may be necessary to also
measure reverse T3. In patients making antibodies to
thyroperoxidase, thyroid function may appear normal
because of compensation of the impaired glandular
output.51 An abnormal serum TSH concentration, with
normal T4 and T3 may be indicative of a subclinical
thyroid disorder (see Table 10.4). Subclinical hypothyroidism was found in up to 16% in some populations,
and is more prevalent in elderly women.52 Hypothyroidism can have a significant effect on metabolic control
and hyperinsulinemia, and is considered an independent
risk factor for atherosclerosis.53 In case-control studies
of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, those who
experienced normalized thyroid function had improved
cardiovascular and insulin markers.54 The relationship
may be explained by a decrease in hepatic lipase with an
increase of TSH.55 Older populations may have greater
rates of undiagnosed hypothyroidism.56
Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis), detected as high
levels of free T3 (FT3) or free T4 (FT4), is most often
autoimmune in origin, although favorable response
to selenium supplementation has been reported.57 In
hyperthyroid patients, TSH will be low or suppressed,
whereas T3 and T4 are generally increased.58 The TSH is
lowered because the pituitary decreases output of TSH
in response to elevated circulating hormone levels.
A pattern of elevated TSH with normal (or low)
T3 and T4 indicates potential essential nutrient limitation of T4 synthesis. Specific results that exemplify this
condition are shown in Table 10.3. These thyroid profile
results are typical of those found for a patient with
impaired TSH response, which may be due to insufficiency of iodine or tyrosine to sustain adequate rates
of thyroglobulin synthesis. Since iodine and tyrosine
are the direct precursors for thyroid hormone synthesis,
supplementation may help to maintain normal thyroid
status in patients with this pattern. When a plasma
amino acid profile is available, low phenylalanine and

can inhibit the conversion of T4 to T3. Extrathyroidal
conversion of T4 to T3 is inversely correlated with plasma
free fatty acid concentration in patients with various
non-thyroidal illnesses, including diabetes mellitus, liver
cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
chronic heart failure.68 The effect is enhanced by adding
oleic acid, especially in patients with lower serum albumin. This effect indicates that the composition of fatty
acids, not just their total concentrations, determines

the magnitude of inhibition.69 On the other hand, fatty
acid composition is influenced by the action of thyroid
hormone. Hypothyroid patients have inhibited delta-6and delta-5-desaturase pathways that cause alterations
of membrane fatty acid composition.70 Conversion of
T4 to T3 was decreased by the administration of alphalipoic acid in animal studies. This decreased conversion apparently resulted from enhancement of tissue
responses to T3, since the treatment was accompanied by
decreased triglyceride levels and stable glucose concentrations.71 Other studies have indicated low levels
of free and esterified carnitine in serum and urine of
patients with thyroid dysfunction. Weakness is common
in both hyper- and hypothyroidism, and skeletal muscle
l-carnitine may play a role in this regard.72 Adding to the
lipoic acid effect, carnitine modulates thyroid hormone
action in peripheral tissues.73 Possibly acting to offset its
mitochondrial stimulation, carnitine antagonizes thyroid
hormone action by inhibiting both T3 and T4 entry into
the cell nuclei. This is relevant because thyroid hormone
action is mainly mediated by specific nuclear receptors.74
Collectively, the results summarized here demonstrate
the potential for improving thyroid hormone function
by normalizing nutritional factors that impact cellular
responses.
Decreased skeletal muscle breakdown, measurable as falling urinary 3-methylhistidine, low insulin
and increased TSH levels have been demonstrated in
thyrotoxic patients and in animals under protein-calorie
malnutrtion.75, 76 These effects on protein turnover suggest that amino acid evaluation is indicated for patients
with abnormal thyroid status. An evaluation of vitamin
A status should be considered in patients with hypothyroidism, because decreased thyroid levels can impair the
conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A.5
In hyperthyroid patients, the risk of oxidative
damage is increased due to the higher metabolic rate.
Research studies found lipid peroxidation was increased
in participants compared with controls, and activities
of antioxidant enzymes were altered. These effects were
significantly reduced when ascorbic acid was supplemented at 1,000 mg/d.77 Other markers of oxidative
damage provide insight about how well a hyperthyroid
patient is controlling oxidative damage (see Chapter 9,
“Oxidant Stress”). Thyroid hormones stimulate synthesis of enzymes, such as mitochondrial cytochrome-c,
that regulate cellular ATP turnover rate. If the various

A strong association has been found between
thyroid dysfunction and non-thyroid autoimmune
diseases.83–86 Patients with altered thyroid function
should be evaluated for autoimmune conditions, and
inflammatory markers. Thyroid function may also be
a significant factor in the metabolic syndrome. Waist
circumference was associated with free T3 and TSH,
independent of insulin status and metabolic markers
in euthyroid women.87 Elevated levels of TSH have also
been positively and significantly associated with hemoglobin A1c.54 Animal studies have found blood glucose
levels to remain elevated for more than 24 hours following a glucose load in rats with altered thyroid status.88

carnitine and elements, are not available to support
metabolic oxidative pathways, the mitochondria cannot
keep up with increased demand. Thus, clinicians treating patients taking thyroid supplements should assess
the patient for nutrient insufficiencies that could make
it more difficult for the thyroid hormone to elicit normal
responses. Complete evaluation of both hypothyroidism
and hyperthyroidism also includes appropriate thyroid
antibody assessment.
The prevalence of goiters is higher in areas with
greater iodine deficiency, although they also result from
impaired thyroid synthesis, or increased intake of goitrogens. Goiters also develop as a result of impaired thyroid
hormone synthesis or increased intake of goitrogens.
The body attempts to normalize thyroid hormone levels
by increasing production of both TRH and TSH. Persistent stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH may result
in increased cellularity and hyperplasia of thyroid tissue,
which can lead to goiter development. The most important differential diagnoses are cancer and autoimmune
thyroid disease. Patients being treated for hypothyroid
should be evaluated for low iodine status, especially as
iodinated salt use has decreased (see the section “Iodine”
in Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements”). Goitrogenic foods contain substances that can interfere with
the uptake of iodine and the utilization of iodine in the
synthesis of thyroid hormone. For patients consuming balanced diets with varied compositions, intake of
dietary goitrogens are not of concern unless there is an
iodine deficiency or evidence of thyroid disease. Thus,
cruciferous vegetables should not be avoided out of a
fear of goitrogenic effects. Goitrogens listed in Table 10.5
act directly or indirectly on the thyroid gland. Of the
goitrogens that act directly on the gland, mechanisms
include inhibition of iodide transport into the thyroid
(thiocyanate and isothiocyanate); interference with
oxidation and organic binding of iodide in the gland;
and interruption of proteolysis, release of hormones,
or dehalogenation.58, 78-80 Goitrogenic effect of foods
is usually destroyed when the foods are cooked. High
thiocyanate intake relative to iodine intake correlates
with goiter prevalence.81 In rats, thiocyanate intake
reduced circulating T4, and when thiocyanate intake was
reduced, circulating T4 normalized.80 Typically, iodine
must be deficient in the diet and goitrogen intake must
be significantly and chronically elevated to bring about
goiter.82 Iodine deficiencies can also be aggravated by
deficiencies of vitamin A, selenium or iron.

Functions: The pancreas is both an endocrine and
exocrine gland. The pancreas functions as an endocrine
gland by secreting hormones such as insulin, glucagon
and somatostatin. The pancreas functions as an exocrine
gland by producing and releasing enzymes that are
utilized in digestion.
Insulin is an anabolic hormone that functions to
increase growth, DNA synthesis and cell replication. Its
primary function is to regulate the cellular uptake of
plasma glucose. Insulin-stimulated increase of glucose uptake is accompanied by increased lipogenesis,

higher circulating insulin concentration affects energy
metabolism by increasing synthesis of triglycerides and
cholesterol, leading to elevations of triglycerides and
LDL cholesterol. Insulin resistance is related to increased
risk of cardiovascular disease,100 obesity, non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease,101 hyperuricemia,102 prehypertension,103 breast cancer,104 aging and small gestational age
at birth.105

Clinical Assessment: Fasting serum insulin
concentrations above 10 IU/mL indicate possible
insulinemia associated with insulin insensitivity or
resistance. Elevated plasma triglycerides and free fatty
acids are considered a hallmark of insulin resistance (see
Case Illustration 5.6 in Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids”). Insulin
resistance can also result in high levels of palmitic and
stearic fatty acids by inhibiting delta-9 desaturase.
Delta-9 desaturase converts saturated fatty acids to
monounsaturated fatty acids. Follow-up testing with a
2-hour glucose tolerance test with insulin readings aids
in the differential diagnosis of dysglycemia and dysinsulinemia. Diets designed to maintain low glycemic load
can help to lower insulin output and reduce the impact
of hyperinsulinemia. Consuming a low glycemic-load
diet may be especially important to individuals with
elevated insulin levels trying to lose weight.106 The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test provides a measure of average
blood sugar levels over the past 2 or 3 months, although
identifying the average or mean may not be an adequate
assessment for those patients with extremely high or low
blood glucose levels. Rises in fasting plasma glucose and
HbA1c may also be seen with increased age as a result of
a decrease of glycemic control, independent of diabetes
status.107
High glycemic-load diets induce insulin secretion,
leading to lowered concentrations of amino acids in
plasma and increased deposition of body fat. Restriction
of high glycemic foods with adequate protein supplied in several small meals may help to stabilize blood
sugar. Amino acids such as arginine have also been
shown to improve insulin output.27 Omega-3 fatty acids
may improve insulin sensitivity.108-111 Chromium and
vanadium have been found effective in aiding insulin
responsiveness of type-2 diabetics, and a higher level
of intracellular magnesium has been found to correlate
with greater insulin responsiveness.42, 112, 113 Rather than
routine introduction of these nutrients, the results from

diminished lipolysis and increased amino acid uptake.
Insulin is first produced as the much larger polypeptide
preproinsulin. Preproinsulin is converted to proinsulin
for pancreatic islet-cell storage. Proinsulin release involves cleavage of a portion called C-peptide to produce
circulating insulin. Proinsulin is homologous with IGF-I
and -II, which can bind the insulin receptor with 10%
affinity of insulin.89 Insulin lowers circulating glucose
levels by increasing the number of membrane glucose
transporters (see Figure 3.17 under “Chromium” in
Chapter 3, “Nutrient and Toxic Elements”). There are
four glucose transporters, referred to GLUT1, GLUT2,
GLUT3 and GLUT4. All require insulin to transport
glucose, although GLUT4 can also be activated by
exercise.90, 91
Insulin may affect neural tissue and modulate
neural metabolism, synapse activity and feeding behaviors.92-94 The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
is considered the insulin-sensing center. There are two
major types of neurons in the arcuate nucleus that are
believed to increase or decrease transcription, and thus
hyperpolarization based on insulin action. They are the
orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/
AgRP) neurons and the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin/cocaine amphetamine-related transcript (POMC/
CART) neurons.95 It is believed that K+-ATP channels in
the hypothalamus may lead to insulin secretion similar
to that found in the beta cells of the pancreas.96
When insulin-sensitive tissues fail to respond and
lower circulating glucose, the pancreas attempts to
secrete greater levels of insulin. The resulting hyperinsulinemia in a patient with normal blood glucose
is referred to as insulin resistance.97 As the resistance
increases, more insulin is secreted for the same glucoselowering response. The excess insulin in circulation
leads to significant health problems. Fasting insulin levels vary, depending on many factors, including level of
insulin resistance, weight, exercise and dietary glucose
load. Normal-weight women were found to have a mean
fasting insulin level of approximately 10 mU/mL, obese
women had 15 mU/mL, and levels ranged from 20 to 35
mU/mL in those with insulin resistance. Within 1 hour
of an oral glucose load, insulin levels increased up to
50 mU/mL in normal-weight women, up to 60 mU/mL
in obese women, and 120 to 180 mU/mL in those with
insulin resistance.98 In those with the most extreme insulin resistance, fasting circulating insulin levels went as
high as 200 mU/mL, and have been documented as high

testing of fatty acids, amino acids and trace elements
can provide effective guidance regarding which diabetic
patients have focal need for specific nutrients.

CRH, also called corticotropin-releasing factor
(CRF), is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in
response to stress that stimulates the anterior lobe of the
pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH), also known as corticotropin. ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex. Impulses from the sympathetic
nervous system are the primary stimulus for release
of the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent, dopamine from the adrenal
medulla. Stimulation of the adrenal cortex leads to the
synthesis of corticosteroids and androgens as illustrated
in Figure 10.2. Corticosteroids include glucocorticoids
(cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).

The allostatic load, defined as the cumulative
physiologic effect of the body’s long-term response to
stress, has been correlated with degenerative diseases
and aging.114-117 These physiologic responses result in
inflammation and immune stimulation from factors such
as anxiety, competition and poor personal relationships.
Laboratory evaluations can give direct clinical insight
about the level of stress and other adverse lifestyle factors that bear on the outcomes from nutritional interventions. The physiological responses to stressors of
various origins are initiated by modulating the output
cellular controls such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
nitric oxide, and eicosanoids and immunomodulators.
Other chapters have covered testing for amino acid
neurotransmitter precursors, organic acids and fatty
acid flow into eicosanoid pathways. Measuring polypeptides, catecholamines, thyroid hormones and steroid
hormones adds valuable clinical information that can
indicate specific nutrient interventions. The well-known
“fight-or-flight response” involves stimulation of both
the cortical and medullary aspects of the adrenal gland,
with an increased synthesis and release of both cortisol
and epinephrine. Short periods of adrenal stimulation
favor the survival of an organism under threat. Persistent
stimulation of the adrenal gland has been shown to play
a role in the development of visceral obesity,117 as well
as insulin resistance.118 Glucocorticoid elevation due to

Precursor of steroid hormones

DHEA is the precursor to testosterone and estrogen. It is involved with development, growth, immune
response and cardiovascular function. DHEA production, and its sulfated form (DHEAS), decrease with
age and may contribute to physiological changes that
are sex-hormone dependent. A randomized, doubleblinded, controlled trial of 140 older adults on either
50 mg/d DHEA or placebo found DHEA replacement
therapy for 1 year improved hip bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults and spine BMD in older
women.121 Other studies have found DHEA replacement
to increase in BMD, as well as partially reversing agerelated changes in fat mass, and fat-free mass.122 DHEA
is the most abundant steroid in the body. It is produced
via cholesterol through two cytochrome P450 enzymes
to pregnenolone, followed by a conversion to DHEA
through the CYP17A1 enzyme. The production takes
place in the adrenal gland.
Because DHEA is a major adrenal precursor for
other hormones, variability of DHEA levels will affect
other hormones as well. When 50 mg of DHEA was
given to postmenopausal women, it increased steroids
that are derived from DHEA, such as estrone, estradiol,
androstenedione, testosterone and DHEA sulfate. In another study, women with Addison’s disease given 50 mg
of DHEA not only normalized DHEA levels, but also
improved IGF-I levels and normalized circulating levels
of testosterone. DHEA may therefore be an effective
hormonal replacement treatment.123 DHEA has immunomodulatory properties as well, further demonstrating the
interconnected web of cell regulators in the body. DHEA
interacts with gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors in the brain, as do benzodiazepines. It may have
some sedating activity, which explains why excessive levels of DHEA may be an early indication of depression.124
When supplementing with DHEA, clinicians should
be aware that even with patients on standard doses of
DHEA, such as 125 to 250 mg/d, and with DHEA blood
levels in normal range, patients may experience elevated
levels of DHEA metabolites. Testing of DHEA levels may
be used to titrate down their current dose of DHEA.

means that the brain is the primary site for control of the
diurnal rhythm. The ratio of the highest levels (8 a.m.)
to the lowest (midnight) is about 10 for saliva and only
3.3 for plasma. Patients with adrenal insufficiency show
the greatest depression of cortisol output in the morning, whereas the hypercortisolemic response of Cushing’s
syndrome is most prominent in the late evening.128
Morning levels may increase with increased psychosocial and environmental stressors in those with sufficient
adrenal function.129 Symptoms of cortisol deficiency and
excess are shown in Table 10.6.
The pituitary-adrenal response can be tested by
measuring serum or salivary cortisol after an oral dose of
the cortisol mimic dexamethasone taken in the evening.
In the normal response, serum cortisol levels drop to
low values by the next morning because the dexamethasone causes the pituitary gland to release less ACTH.
Cushing’s syndrome patients sustain high cortisol levels,
and those with other conditions such as major depression and post-traumatic stress response may produce
sustained high cortisol levels after the dexamethasone
suppression test.130-132

STRESS RESPONSES

CORTISOL (nM)

Cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid involved in
the regulation of glucose metabolism and the body’s
response to stress. During times of stress, cortisol levels
increase and accelerate the breakdown of proteins
to provide the fuel to maintain body functions. This
catabolic activity needs to be balanced with periods of
rebuilding to maintain good health. Under the influence
of cortisol, the body can adapt to new stresses and survive until the physiological defense mechanisms are exhausted, or until the stress subsides. Selye, a pioneer in
the study of the effects of stress on the body, termed this
phenomenon the “general adaptation syndrome.”125 The
ability to avoid multiple stress effects from mineral and
water imbalances is due to adrenal steroid hormones.
Animals can survive without adrenal glands if they are
given small doses of adrenal hormones, but they are
unable to adapt to any major chemical or physical stress,
and cannot tolerate temperature extremes, starvation,
infection, sensitizing agents or noxious chemicals.126
Although variation in cortisol output is related to
stress, the circadian rhythm of cortisol is linked to the
sleep-wake cycle and controlled by the suprachiasmatic
nucleus in the hypothalamus. Thus, interactions with
other compounds can have significant effects. Secretions
are characterized by a steep increase in the morning,
peaking at approximately 8 a.m., followed by a gradual
tapering off until about midnight, when circulating
levels are at their lowest (Figure 10.3). The episodic
secretion of cortisol is caused by the intermittent

norepinephrine.133 An example of the relationship of
these hormones to mental stress is the 42% increase in
urinary VMA in cows in response to the stress of exposure to flies.134 Sympathetic nerve endings in the adrenal
gland release epinephrine, and those in all other tissues
release norepinephrine. Treatments aimed at improving
protein digestion and supplementation of the amino acid
precursor tyrosine can normalize neurotransmitter levels
in the CNS.135 The precursor relationship of tyrosine to
epinephrine also gives rise to the antihypertensive role
of tyrosine.136 Patients with hypertension show lower
VMA and 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5-HIAA) levels when
treated with a selective serotonergic antagonist.137 Thus
the levels of VMA in urine are shown to be responsive
to agents designed to block hormone action as well as to
externally imposed stress.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis)
refers to the complex interactions between the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the adrenal gland. The
interactions between these three organs are a major part
of the neuroendocrine system that controls reactions
to stress and activates the HPA axis (Figure 10.1). The
adrenal steroids are a family of hormones that permit
us to make long-term adjustments to stress and include
cortisol and DHEA, both produced in the adrenal cortex.
The adrenal gland normally produces much more DHEA
than cortisol. Cortisol and DHEA affect carbohydrate,
protein and lipid metabolism; serve as anti-inflammatory agents; modulate thyroid function; and increase
resistance to stress. Thus, fluctuating amounts of DHEA
and cortisol may signal important alterations in adrenal function that can profoundly affect an individual’s
energy levels, emotional state, disease resistance and
general sense of well-being. In health, when stressors are
removed, the hormone levels fall back into the normal
range. The supply of precursors may become limited,
and under conditions of chronic stress, the adrenal
glands enter a compensated phase in which the production of the stress hormones is altered. The quantitatively
more demanding DHEA pathway is frequently the first
to experience the repercussions of this situation. Because
of such differences in response to ACTH, the production
of DHEA usually declines with chronic stress, whereas,
initially, cortisol remains elevated. Patients who maintain
elevated levels of cortisol, even under psychologically
non-stressful situations, have a habituated endocrine

effects. Stress-induced damage to the hippocampus, an
area involved in memory processes and especially affected in Alzheimer’s disease, is prevented by DHEA.145 Low
DHEA further contributes to conditions associated with
aging, such as osteopenia, decreased lean muscle and
increased fat mass. When patients in their 70s took 50
mg of DHEA for 6 months, fat-free mass increased, fat
mass decreased and bone mineral density increased.122
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), chronic pelvic pain, post-traumatic stress
disorder, and other stress-related disorders may also be
characterized by alterations in HPA-axis activity.146
The same progression for cortisol may ensue if pregnenolone becomes exhausted. If the stress is prolonged,

stress response, which may lead to adrenal fatigue
(Figure 10.4). Patients with elevated cortisol may have
greater urinary losses of B-vitamins, lowered mineral
status, and reduced absorption of calcium, and a greater
need for vitamins C and E.138,139 Basic physiology can
explain the relationship between stress and nutrition. If
one is always in a heightened state of stress, they exist
in the sympathetic state, which may impede proper
digestion, further compounding nutrient insufficiencies. Several dietary changes are also recommended in
adrenal fatigue, such as eating by 10 a.m. each morning;
eating small frequent meals; and avoiding caffeine, high
glycemic index foods and alcohol.
The entire process is shown graphically in
Figure 10.4, where the initial stress response is labeled
“A1.” As higher cortisol is required to shut down adrenal
responses and bring ACTH into the normal range, the
negative feedback of cortisol on the hypothalamus is
lost. The resulting condition, known as “physiological
hypercortisolemia,” affects enzyme activities and can
lead to central adiposity.140 Primate studies show effects
of lowered serum phosphate and increased estrogenic
responses with increased cortisol levels.141 Monozygotic,
female twin pairs showed a high degree of stability in
a.m. and p.m. cortisol values collected daily over a
14-day period. Salivary cortisol was significantly higher
for those siblings with a major history of depression
than for their non-depressed twins.142 Cushing’s disease
is characterized by constantly elevated levels in the upper right of quadrant “A1.” Nighttime salivary cortisol
testing is an accurate way to screen for hypercortisolism
in children.143 Stress-induced hormonal secretion is
greater in older individuals than in their young counterparts, and increases in blood pressure with stress
become greater with age.144
Later phases of compensated response may go
through the progression from “A2” to “A5.” The progression has been called “stress fixation.” The arrow shows
a progression from the upper right to upper left because
DHEA is the first to decrease. Because DHEA has much
higher normal concentrations, the supply of precursors, especially pregnenolone, can become difficult to
maintain. Adrenal cortical output of DHEA falls from
high to normal to low. Such a profile of low DHEA with
high cortisol is typical of a high-achiever lifestyle. As
long as cortisol output is sustained at elevated levels,
such intense demands for physiological function may be
maintained, but the low DHEA has long-term negative

Notes:

## Assessment of Adrenal Hormones

About 1 to 10% of the steroids in the blood are in
unbound or free form. The rest are bound to carrier
proteins such as cortisol-binding globulin, sex hormonebinding globulin and albumin. Subtle structural abnormalities due to genetic variation can lead to primary
endocrine abnormalities because of impaired bindingprotein affinities. Adrenal hyperfunction has been associated with impairment of cortisol binding.154 Since only
unbound steroids can freely diffuse into various target
tissues in the body, they are the only hormones that are
considered biologically active. Saliva testing measures
the free-circulating, biologically active hormones.155
The relationship of serum and salivary cortisol has been
thoroughly examined.156 Using single measurements of
11 p.m. salivary cortisol, elevated levels identified primary depressive patients with a sensitivity of 62.5% and
a specificity of 75%.128 Salivary cortisol concentrations at
11 p.m. have been shown to predict bone loss in elderly
men,157 demonstrating the long-term effects of cortisol on
bone mineral maintenance. Circadian variations are more
marked in saliva than in plasma. The cortisol response to
stress is developed at birth. Salivary cortisol determination in neonates has been proposed as a helpful measure
to control for neonatal stress and birth asphyxia.158

the production of both hormones falls into the sector
labeled “C.” Individuals affected with Addison’s disease,
where the adrenals are unable to produce stress hormones, have values that fall into the C sector. The more
infrequent finding of elevated DHEA with normal or low
cortisol (sector B) is found in hypothalamic dysfunction,
and these individuals should avoid high-stress occupations. Cognitive stress management intervention can
reduce the rate of progression toward the stress fixation
state. A 23% reduction in cortisol and a 100% increase
in DHEA were found in individuals who demonstrated
response to treatment by improved scales of guilt, hostility, burnout, anxiety and stress.147 DHEA increases by
10% after exercise, mandating lifestyle changes as a part
of a healthy adrenal response.148
Muscle protein breakdown caused by increased
stress hormones can be reduced by administration of an
amino acid solution. Increased adrenal activity also leads
to greater loss of B-complex vitamins that should be
replaced. Finally, vitamin C should be added to prevent
tissue depletion, because it can be rapidly diminished by
the adrenal stress response. Vitamin C has an enhancing
effect on adrenal glucocorticoid production.149, 150 A vitamin C deficiency can cause an elevation in cortisol that
could lead to suppression of the inflammatory response,
impairment of wound healing and decrease in bone
matrix formation.
Omega-6 fatty acids are specifically depleted in
individuals with high cortisol output.151 Dietary supplements of linoleic or gamma-linolenic may be used to
replenish tissue status of these fatty acids, but there is
an important question of balance of omega-6 fatty acids
with the omega-3 family in order to maintain the proper
tissue responses to challenges. Patients with elevated
cortisol may need to be evaluated for polyunsaturated
fatty acid status (see Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids”). Licorice
consumption potentiates the effects of cortisol, and
hypokalemic hypertension can be induced by licorice
addiction.152 The effect is not a result of adrenocortical
stimulation, but rather, a reduction in the conversion of
cortisol to cortisone.153 As the degree of stress fixation
becomes greater, these interventions become more important, and aggressiveness of nutrient support should
increase. Other evaluations of overall nutrient status allow optimization of adrenal response and improvement
of total-body response to, and need for, the adrenal
cortical hormones. Of course, cognitive stress reduction
training is of value at any point in the process.
## ACTH Challenge Test
An ACTH challenge test will give information about
how well the adrenal gland responds when recruited
by the pituitary to respond to stress. This challenge test
assesses the ability of the adrenal cortex to respond to
ACTH by an appropriate response in increased cortisol
production. Blood or serum levels of cortisol are obtained 1 hour before and 1 hour after injection of ACTH.
Cortisol should increase to at least 20 μg/dL in serum,
1 hour post-ACTH challenge. Serum and salivary levels
have been found to be highly correlative.159 Salivary
samples may be of more clinical utility because of the
less invasive method.160 It has been hypothesized that
the stress of a blood draw may be enough to alter cortisol output, especially when serial samples are involved.

Laboratory Evaluations
Serum GnRH

Activities of the sex glands are regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a peptide hormone
produced by the hypothalamus that stimulates the
anterior pituitary gland to begin secreting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
FSH stimulates follicular maturation and estradiol secretion in the ovaries. After the follicle ruptures the ovaries
produce progesterone. LH acts on the Leydig cells of the
testes to stimulate the production of testosterone. The
ratio of LH to FSH is determined by the frequency of
GnRH pulses secreted from the hypothalamus, as well as
by feedback from androgens and estrogens.170 Low-frequency GnRH pulses lead to FSH release, whereas highfrequency GnRH pulses stimulate LH release. GnRH is
secreted at different frequencies in males and females.
Females have a large surge of GnRH just before ovulation, the rest of the month the frequency of the pulses
varies during the menstrual cycle. Males experience a
constant pulse. GnRH activity varies by age. Typically,
GnRH is very low during childhood and increased synthesis and release is activated at the onset puberty. The
pulsatile release of GnRH may be affected by hypothalamic-pituitary disease, elevated prolactin levels and hyperinsulinemia. In light of the obvious interrelationship
with the endocrine system, achieving homeostatis with
the administration of exogenous sources can be difficult.

discussion). Salivary levels of sIgA may be used to
monitor this immune-barrier function. Although sIgA
production requires an adequate amino acid supply,
dietary protein inadequacy has little effect on sIgA levels.162 Chronic stress, however, decreases sIgA production.163 The measurement of sIgA as a biomarker for the
functional impact of chronic stress greatly enhances the
interpretation of stress hormones because single-point
elevations of cortisol may be only a normal, temporary
stress response. Low sIgA is a sign of the impact of stress
directly on the immune system, but elevated sIgA reveals
another site of degeneration affected by stress.
The production of IgA is increased when dietary
antigens are not blocked by the physical barrier in the
small intestine. In human IgA nephropathy, there is a
significant decrease in levels of IgA immune complexes
after patients are put on a gluten-free diet. In patients
with elevated IgA, gluten may act as a toxic lectin,
increasing the permeability of the intestinal mucosa to
various dietary antigens.164, 165 Some individuals with
only modest IgA deficits can have substantial mucosal
permeability defects on milk challenge.166 IgA antibodies also help to clear Candida albicans from mucosal
surfaces. IgA levels are lower in women who show
positive cultures for Candida albicans.167 This connection
provides an explanation for the increased incidence of
invasive candidiasis in highly stressed individuals.

Chronic stress is a factor in the onset of the gluten
sensitivity characteristic of celiac disease. The corollary
is also true; gluten sensitivity contributes a significant
stress to the body and can add clinical value to adrenal
hormone assessment. Detection of IgA-class antigliadin
antibody provides an immunohistochemical marker
of celiac disease latency and gluten sensitivity.168 Early
dietary treatment is important in conditions such as
celiac disease to avoid malnutrition and the development of malignant disorders. Any condition that causes
deterioration of the epithelial layer of the small intestine
can lead to increased gliadin antibodies. IgG antigliadin
antibody concentrations were elevated in subjects with
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and positive luminal antigliadin antibodies.169

Functions: Estrogen’s most basic biological function
is to stimulate tissue growth, whereby it is involved in
the regular restoration of the endometrium and, during
pregnancy, in the expansion of breast tissue. The relatively massive, cyclic uterine tissue replacement process
is a major source of macro- and micronutrient demand
in menstruating women. Its cyclic nature requires control of the large shifts in rates of cell division, along with
stimulation of the associated biosynthetic pathways. In
the ovaries, estrogen is produced from cholesterol as
shown in Figure 10.5. Redundant pathways from the
pregnenolone and progesterone precursors assure routes
of synthesis, even when point genetic mutations occur.
Testosterone is aromatized to estradiol (E2), which is
reduced to form estrone (E1) in a reversible reaction. Estradiol can be reconverted to estrone or further hydroxylated to form estriol (E3) (Figure 10.6). FSH stimulates
Notes:
estradiol secretion in the ovaries. All three forms have
varying levels of activity and specificity for different tissue. Estradiol is the most active of the estrogens responsible for actions attributed to the estrogens. Estriol has
an intermediate activity and estrone is the least active of
the estrogens. Estrone increases with menopause and is
mostly derived from androstenedione. Estradiol plays
a role in immune activation, and potentially overactivation.171, 172 Estrogens are the major steroid anabolic
hormones in females before menopause.
Estrone metabolites include 2-hydroxyestrone,
4-hydroxyestrone, and 16α-hydroxyestrone. Research
has found 2-hydroxyestrone formation is catalyzed predominantly by CYP1A2, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes;
4-hydroxyestrone formation is catalyzed predominantly
by CYP1B1, CYP1A2 and CYP1A1 enzymes; and 16αhydroxyestrone formation is catalyzed predominantly
by CYP2C19, CYP1A1 and CYP3A5 (Figure 10.7).173
In addition to estrogens and their metabolites having
different levels of activities, a large part of how estrogen
affects tissue depends on the receptor affinity. There are
three distinct types of estrogen receptors, estrogen-α, -β
and -γ. Different tissues have varying numbers of each
of these receptor sites. The selective effects of estrogens
and their analogs may be due to the differential distribution of each estrogen receptor (ER) subtype in various
tissues.174 The tissue distribution and/or the relative
levels of ER-α and ER-β expression in rats are quite different. There is a moderate-to-high expression of ER-α
in the breast, testis, pituitary, ovary, kidney, epididymis,
and adrenal gland, and a relatively high expression of
ER-β in the prostate, ovary, lung, bladder, brain, uterus
and testis. The differential expression of ER-α and ER-β
within individual tissues may contribute to the selective effects of estrogen within individual tissues. For
example, in the rat and human prostate, ER-α and ER-β
are differentially expressed in the secretory epithelia and
stromal tissues. It is also clear that estrogens exert organizational effects on the rat and mouse prostate, since
neonatal exposure to 17β-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol
causes permanent changes not only in the size of the
prostate, but also in the expression level of certain genes.

Upon stimulation by FSH and LH, a series of oxidation, reduction and isomerization reactions converts cholesterol to the sex
hormones in the ovaries and testes. Several of the reactions use the same enzymes needed for steroid hormone synthesis in
the adrenal glands. The aromatase reactions produce the aromatic ring of the estrogens seen in Figure 10.6. The secreted
hormones bind to sex hormone-binding globulin for delivery to target tissues, where they interact with nuclear receptors to

Figure 10.6 — Pathways that Compete for Estrone
Estrone has three principal fates. It may undergo reduction to estradiol or hydroxylation at the 2 or 16α positions. Reduction
of the keto group of 16α-hydroxyestrone produces estriol. The 2- and 16α-hydroxyestrones are major excretory products,
appearing in ratios above 2:1 in healthy states. Small fractions of these two derivatives are also methylated by catechol-Omethyl transferase and SAMe to form methoxy derivatives. A further hydroxylation at the 4 position (not shown) occurs to
only small extents, but 4-hydroxyestrone has estrogen activity and carcinogenic properties.

difficulty sleeping and an increase in irritability. High
levels are also associated with increased risk of cancer and highly proliferative breast tissue, resulting in
fibroids or cysts.178 Many of these same symptoms are
experienced with menopause, when estrogen levels fall.
The fluctuations of estrogen levels may be more important than their concentrations for producing symptoms
and requiring the body to establish a new “set point.”
Thus, the erratic levels of estrogen during menopause
have been speculated to be responsible for symptoms.179,
It is possible that estrogen responses are bimodal,
with levels that are too high resulting in dysfunctions
similar to levels that are too low. When estrogen levels
are too low, breast cells will not “mature” properly.
Women are born with type 1 lobules in the breast,
which progress to type 2 with puberty, finally maturing into types 3 and 4 after the thirty-second week of
pregnancy. This maturation, which happens with high
levels of hormones, makes the tissue more resistant to
mutations.
Elevated levels of estradiol can simulate an immune
response. Estradiol also possesses neuroprotective and
antiapoptotic properties as an N-methyl-d-aspartate
(NMDA) antagonist. Exposure of glutamatergic neurons
in cell culture to estradiol or estriol has revealed decreased rates of apoptosis and necrosis. Estriol was found
to have more of a protective effect, even though estradiol is bound more tightly to the estrogen receptor.181
Research has also found appropriate levels of estradiol
to reduce reactive oxygen species,182 increase coronary
blood flow183 and decrease bladder disorders by reducing
neurogenic inflammation. However, an increase in breast
cancer risk has been associated with elevated estradiol, as
well as an increased growth of prostate cancer cells.184
The use of hormones in perimenopausal, premenopausal or menopausal women (often referred to as hormone replacement therapy, or HRT) involves treatment
with either estrogen alone or estrogen administered in

Additionally, in the rat ovary, the levels of ER-β expression vary within compartments of ovarian tissue. ER-α
is expressed at a low level throughout the rat ovary with
no particular cellular localization. Finally, in primary
osteoblasts isolated from the bone of neonatal rats, both
ER-α and ER-β were detected, although the level of ERβ was much higher. The fact that both estrogen receptors are expressed in bone helps to explain the beneficial
effects of estrogens on bone mineral density.175 It is
important to keep in mind that in addition to the type
of estrogen and the type of receptor as well as binding
affinity, all of these factors are affected by how functional
or healthy the receptor is. For example, higher levels of
inflammation can impact estrogen receptor reactivity.176
Oxidative stress should be assessed to assure adequate
hormone function. Markers for oxidative stress, such
as p-hydroxyphenyllactate, 8-hydroxy2 deoguanosine,
hsC-reactive protein and lipid peroxides, are discussed
in Chapter 6, “Organic Acids,” and Appendix A, “Comprehensive Cardiovascular Health Risk Assessment.”
Estrogen is cleared by Phase I and Phase II hepatic
detoxification reactions. Phase I consists of three major
pathways via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system;
Phase II, sulfation, methylation and glucuronidation
help to further detoxify Phase I products (Figure 10.7).
Amino acids status is important to consider alongside
hormone therapy. The follicular phase must facilitate
rapid growth of tissue. Amino acid substrate must be
plentiful for this function to occur. Estrogen has anabolic
effects elsewhere in the body, which are impossible to
perform unless nutrition is adequate. In fact, as estradiol
increases, the activity of branched-chain α-dehydrogenase complex is decreased to increase the amount of
essential amino acids available. Variations in breakdown
of branched-chain amino acids are seen in females, and
not males, that correlate with levels of estrogen.177
Clinical Assessment: High levels of estrogen are
characterized by symptoms such as increased anxiety,

progestin outweighs the benefits. Nevertheless, a risk
versus benefit assessment should be made on a “per
patient basis.” For example, in a patient with a history of osteoporosis-related bone fractures and no
personal or family history of atherosclerotic disease
or breast cancer, one could make a case for the WHI
study showing that the benefits of HRT outweigh the
risks—in this patient. Among the risks observed after
5.6 years of follow-up were increased risks of breast
cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots. Thus, the
potential negative effects of estrogen have dampened
the enthusiasm about hormone replacement. In fact,
studies focused on problems with estrogen replacement
have led to concerns about the risk of aberrant estrogen metabolism in premenopausal women.185 The role
played by estrogen metabolism in hormone-sensitive
diseases has come from studies of estrogen-dependent
neoplasms of reproductive organs. With respect to breast
cell malignancies, estradiol is believed to act primarily
as a promotional factor, causing increased growth rates
in breast cells already transformed to a cancerous state.
However, estradiol is not the only active estrogen in the
human body. Other metabolites formed from estradiol
have the capacity to act as estrogens, and in some cases,
as antiestrogens.
The increased risk from estrogen and estrogen metabolites has led to a search for compounds that produce
estrogen-like effects safely and decrease the production
of 16α-hydroxyestrone (16OHE1). Soy isoflavones (e.g.,
daidzein and genistein) are natural compounds that
have come closest to meeting these criteria. They are
increased by eating a diet rich in soy products.186 Soy

combination with progesterone. Hormone replacement
therapy has been used for decades to prevent menopausal symptoms such as irritability, “hot flashes” and increased bone loss, although clinical signs and symptoms
alone are often insensitive parameters by which to judge
a patient’s estrogen level. Thus, testing of estrogen levels
is recommended due to the potential adverse effects of
either elevated or depressed levels. Synthetic hormones
are not amenable to laboratory testing of “normal,” and
can only be assessed for therapeutic levels. Considerable
concern should also be given to downstream estrogen
metabolites that result as a consequence of supplementing with synthetic estrogen. Testing and adjustments
can be made to non-synthetic supplemented, or natural,
hormones. Testing of hormone levels must account for
timing of menstrual cycle in premenopausal women
(Figure 10.8). Estrogen and progesterone measurements
allow the determination of peak values within broad
ranges of cycle phases, and when 15 to 20 points are
tested over a month interval, hormone output may be
assessed by observing the degree of rise at ovulation. In
order to evaluate the full physiological impact of estrogen hormones, a more complete profile that includes
estrone and estriol may be done so that total estrogen
can be calculated. Total estrogen reference values are
shown in Table 10.7. Direct assay of total estrogens is
also available.
The best evidence for the risks and benefits of
menopausal hormone replacement therapy come from
the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), an NIH randomized clinical trial of more than 16,000 healthy women.
The trial showed that the overall risk of estrogen plus

products have many estrogen-like properties, though
they operate through different receptor sites on target
tissues.187-189 Although much research has found soy
isoflavones to have little or no effect on induction of
tumors, recent studies have found that the simultaneous
consumption of isoflavone supplements with Tamoxifen
may increase tumor risk.190 Dietary intake of soy products191 and flax192 have been shown to favorably modulate the rates of 2- versus 16-hydroxyestrone production.
Though some studies have not found soy or soy extracts
to lessen vasomotor symptoms of menopause, or slow
postmenopausal bone loss.193, 194

Estrogen Clearance and the 2:16 Ratio
The major metabolites of estradiol and estrone
are those hydroxylated at either the C-2 or the C-16
positions (Figure 10.9). Most, but not all, studies have
found that women with a high urinary 2-hydroxyestrogen (2OHE) to 16α-hydroxyestrone (16OHE) ratio are
at a reduced risk of breast cancer. The most consistent

associations were observed with invasive cancer in
premenopausal women.195 A decreased risk of metastasis was also found with an improved ratio.196 2OHE
is essentially devoid of peripheral biological activity,
as shown in studies on uterine weight, gonadotrophin
secretion and cell proliferation.197 2OHE has also been
found to exert a modest antiestrogenic effect,198 , 199 and
to have antiproliferative properties200 and antiangiogenic
effects, as well as to inhibit mitotic progression through
disruption of spindle formation.201 It has therefore been
called “the good estrogen.”202 Not only does it modulate
estrogen activity by blocking more stimulating forms of
estrogen, it also interacts directly with the DNA, increasing expression of a gene that is involved in apoptosis.
2OHE has also been found to decrease lipid peroxidation of neuronal tissue, offering protection to the CNS.203
16OHE and estriol (E3) are estrogen agonists204 that
have been found to initiate neoplastic change in mammary tissue.205 Tumors in estrogen-sensitive tissues
may be promoted by 16OHE. Women with breast and

and protein, as well as decreased smoking, decreased
caffeine intake, and exercise have all been shown to
favorably impact both 2- and 16OHE.213-217 Flaxseed
supplementation at 10 g/d significantly increases the
urinary 2-:16-hydroxyestrone ratio.192, 218 Soy isoflavones
and foods or extracts containing indole-3 carbinol (I3C)
have also been found to improve the 2:16 ratio.219, 220
Even though a large body of research exists demonstrating safety with I3C, more recent studies may begin to
favor diindolylmethane (DIM), a derivative of I3C, because it is not dependent on acidification in the gut, and
it does not

endometrial cancers have been found to have marked
elevation of 16OHE, which is a significant risk factor for
such estrogen-dependent tumors.206, 207 Research substantiates looking at the ratio of 2OHE and 16OHE, not
only for a risk factor for breast cancer, but also for other
conditions of inappropriate estrogen activity. 16OHE is
more stimulating to tissue than 2OHE, contributing to
mitotic and proliferative states of disease. Interestingly,
it is thought that this same stimulatory activity helps to
maintain bone density.208 16OHE has been found to be
elevated in unregulated or overactive immune system
conditions.209 Estrogen metabolism should be considered with treatment of most autoimmune conditions.
In a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and
systemic lupus erythematosus, 16OHE was found to be
10 times higher in patients compared with controls. It
was speculated that the elevated 16OHE may contribute
to the maintenance of the proliferative state in these diseases.210 Because there is an optimal level of both 2- and
16-hydroxyestrone, a ratio comparing the two levels can
be very helpful.
The ratio of 2OHE to 16OHE (estrogen metabolite
index, or EMI) should be greater than 2.0, and values
in the upper-normal range are advisable (Table 10.8).
Any woman using HRT who has a low EMI should be
monitored closely for improvements in the urinary metabolites. In a large multicenter study of 10,786 women
who were followed for 5.5 years, the results showed that
the higher the 2:16 ratio, the lower the risk of breast
cancer.211 As the ratio of 2OHE to 16OHE decreases,
the severity of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis also
increases.212 Testing for the urinary levels of 2OHE and
16OHE provides valuable insight regarding risk and can
be nutritionally altered.197, 199, 204
Unlike certain risk factors for cancer, such as genetics, a 2:16 ratio is highly treatable. Lifestyle factors can
influence the individual markers as well as the ratio.
Increased consumption of polyphenol-containing foods
and flaxseeds, and adequate intake of dietary calcium

Figure 10.10 — 13C and DIM Structures
The glucosinolate form of I3C that occurs in foods is
hydrolyzed in the stomach to I3C, which then undergoes
dimerization to form DIM.

DIM and I3C are both used to help modulate estrogen metabolism. Estrogens are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes that are inducible by compounds
found in vegetables of the Brassica family, such as cabbage, brussels sprouts and broccoli.221 Two phytochemicals contained in these foods, I3C and DIM, have been
identified as active inducers of certain P450 isozymes.222
The reaction catalyzed by these P450 isozymes produces 2-hydroxylation of estradiol. Induction of P450
by I3C results in decreased concentrations of several
metabolites known to activate the estrogen receptor.223

Functions: Progesterone is known to affect reproduction, sleep quality, respiration, mood, appetite,
learning, memory and sexual activity. It is primarily
thought of as a reproductive hormone. It increases during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and levels
increase significantly with pregnancy. As a reproductive
hormone it is progesterone’s role to maintain the lining
of the uterus. Progesterone increases up until ovulation,
and if a fertilized egg implants on the uterine wall, it is
the corpus lustrum’s job to maintain the increasing levels
of progesterone to keep the endometrial tissue intact.
If there is no fertilized egg, progesterone levels will fall,
causing the lining to shed and menstruation to begin. A
symptom of low progesterone is dysfunctional uterine bleeding. When progesterone levels are adequate,
there will be less uterine contractions, cramping and
pain. Progesterone increases sensitivity of the uterus to
estrogen by modifying estrogen receptors in the uterus.
It also has a number of regulatory effects on estrogen,
including down-regulating estrogen receptors, inhibiting
estrogen transcription, increasing sulfurtransferases, and
inducing apoptosis and cell differentiation. Progesterone
receptors function similarly to estrogen receptors, via
nuclear receptors that initiate DNA transcription.
Progesterone has a key role as an intermediate in the
biosynthesis of androgens, estrogens and the corticoids.
Progesterone is synthesized from pregnenolone, a derivative of cholesterol, and can be converted to cortisol,
aldosterone, testosterone or estrogen, depending on the

One of the acidification products I3C is speculated to be
responsible for an increased production of 4OHE, which
exerts a stimulatory effect on estrogen-sensitive tissue. If
the P450 enzyme is not sufficiently active, a competing
pathway causes 16-hydroxylation, leading to an increase
in 16OHE. Other constituents in the cruciferous family are also speculated to aid in estrogen metabolism.
Glutathione S-transferase has also been found to be
up-regulated by the sulfur constituents in cruciferous
vegetables. Brassica vegetables also improve glucuronidation, aiding with elimination of estrogen metabolites.
Compounds that aid estrogen metabolism were found
to decrease DNA damage, quantifiable by 8-hydroxy2-deoxyguanasine, an oxidative marker discussed in
Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.” Women who have a low
EMI may be treated with I3C and DIM supplements
and sulfur-containing supplements, as well as with
ground flaxseed and soy. Some in-vitro evidence suggests that I3C may increase 4-hydroxylation of estrone,
a potentially pro-carcinogenic effect. However, when
dosing is properly adjusted and monitored, the effect
is largely a reduction in CyP1B1 that sharply inhibits
4-hydroxylation.224, 225
Altering the ratio with IC3 has shown promising therapeutic effect, not only for estrogen receptor
positive cancers, but also for estrogen receptor negative
cancers.196 Research regarding the 2:16 ratio was also of
clinical value for other cancers. In a group of 8 cervical cancer patients, 4 had complete remission, as their
2:16 ratio improved in a dose-dependent fashion. The
greatest response was seen in the group taking 200 mg/d
of I3C.226 Because metabolites are being considered,
the preferred method for measuring 2:16 ratio is in the
urine. The 2:16 ratio does not fluctuate with timing of
the menstrual cycle or with menopausal status. Results
remain consistent regardless of changes in levels.227
Expected values can be seen in Table 10.8.
Notes:

Clinical Assessment: Abnormally high levels of
progesterone will affect activity of other hormones in the
body, altering an individual’s biochemistry. Increased levels can increase sulfatase activity, leading to an increase
in free estrogen. Excessive progesterone may overly
antagonize estrogen, resulting in urinary incontinence.
Excessive levels can also cause decreased coordination,
slowed reflexes, and impaired memory and reasoning
skills. Some research has shown excessive progesterone
to cause migraines. Chronic fatigue patients should
monitor progesterone levels closely, as higher levels
were found in this population group, especially when
depression was present.228 Excessive levels of progesterone also increase the risk of diabetes.229 It appears that
progesterone administration is most effective short term,
or in a pulsed fashion. Continuous dosing can result in
paradoxical effects.230
Research studies have not always distinguished
between progesterone and progestins, something that
could have a significant impact on interpreting the
results.231 Progestins are synthetically produced progestogens and have been around since the 1950s. A
micronized capsule version of natural progesterone
(derived from yams) is also available.232 Natural progesterone was found to cause negative mood effects similar
to those induced by synthetic progestogens.233 Bioidentical progesterone, when compared with synthetic
progestins, has not been shown to have a negative effect

on blood lipids or vasculature, and it has been shown
to offer other benefits.234 Some progesterone metabolites are extremely potent, and their effects should be
considered when adding the hormone. Because too
little or too much can be an issue, progesterone should
be monitored and tailored. Progesterone and estrogen
receptors are both found in the same areas of the brain
and include the hypothalamus and limbic system. Thus,
balancing progesterone and estrogen is essential. Males
synthesize less progesterone than women, although it is
still vital. In a study of 38 morbidly obese men, progesterone was negatively associated with markers of obesity
such as BMI, waist circumference and subcutaneous
adipocyte diameter.235
There are many natural treatments that will increase
production or use of progesterone, such as smilax, damiana and vitex. Vitamin C has been shown to increase
serum progesterone levels. This may be because of vitamin C’s ability to improve the adrenal gland function of
making precursors to reproductive hormones.236
Progesterone has anti-inflammatory properties.
By inhibiting the enzyme in the prostaglandin cascade
responsible for production of COX, matrix metalloproteinases and different cytokines, progesterone modulates
immune function.237 COX-2 plays an important role
in mammary carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in human breast cancer. Studies have shown overexpression
of COX-2 in breast cancer.238 Research has compared
COX-2 mRNA expression with hormone receptor status
in breast cancer. COX-2 mRNA expression was associated with progesterone receptor positivity in human
breast cancer.239 COX-2 has been hypothesized to upregulate aromatase activity. Aromatase is a recognized
promoter of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
Progesterone’s ability to alleviate inflammatory and lipid
peroxidation responses has also been shown to improve
the recovery and disability of patients with acute severe
head injury.240
Progesterone is a neurosteroid that modulates
neuronal excitability. Much research has been done with
progesterone modulating neurological function. Progesterone has been found to reduce anxiety. It acts in the
amygdala to modulate anxiety, fear and pain response.241
Clinical trials have found progesterone to be a stronger anxiolytic than diazepam.242 It has been proposed
that it modulates GABA receptors.243 Research has also
shown progesterone to decrease seizures in women with
epilepsy. It may help to regulate myelin synthesis in glial

tissue. FSH stimulates follicular maturation, leading to
the production of progesterone. A small amount is also
produced in the adrenal glands, testes and brain. After
menopause, the adrenals are a primary production site.

Clinical Assessment: Most, 97 to 98%, of plasma
testosterone is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin
(SHBG) or albumin. Albumin is easily dissociated and
is bound to 33 to 54% of testosterone.254 SHBG binds
a greater proportion of testosterone, 44 to 65%, and
binds much more strongly. It interacts with cell surface
receptors and may initiate a cascade reaction, though it
does not bind to the androgen receptor.255 Only 2 to 3%
of available plasma testosterone is free. Free testosterone
and albumin-bound testosterone are available to bind to
the androgen receptor, and is sometimes referred to as
the bioavailable testosterone or BAT.254, 256 Testosterone
assessments should therefore identify the SHBG level as
well as the total testosterone level.
Testosterone testing may be done in saliva, which
reflects the free testosterone in serum. Total serum
testosterone is also useful to determine whether there
is normal response of the Leydig cells to FSH and LH.
Simultaneous determination of total testosterone and
SHBG allows the calculation of free testosterone concentration, sometimes called the free androgen index (FAI).
Bone mineral density is positively correlated with FAI in
elderly males.257 Measurement of FAI in infertile women
reveals an association of ovarian dysfunction with
hyperandrogenism.258
When testing testosterone in women, one should be
mindful of the fact that women have a midcycle peak in
serum testosterone. Unbound testosterone increases in
the follicular phase.259 Additionally, time of day should
be considered. Mean testosterone concentration has
been noted to drop as much as 50% from morning to
evening. Testing should be done at the same time of day
to provide accurate baseline and follow-up information.260 Serum testosterone levels were found to be stable
throughout the morning and early afternoon for men in
a large population study.261
Testosterone levels in men decrease with age, obesity and diabetes.261, 262 Levels reach a peak at around 20
years of age and decline steadily thereafter. Andropause
is a change in hormone levels experienced by men, similar to menopause in women.263, 264 Symptoms include diminished libido, decreased feeling of general well-being,
osteoporosis, decreased quality of life, anemia, depression, cognitive decline and sexual dysfunction, as well as

cells. Progesterone-activated pathways provide neural
protection mediated through brain-derived neurotrophic
factor.244 Other neurologic mechanisms of progesterone include an increased production of dopamine. In a
patient with low dopamine turnover, indicated by a low
homovanillate, testing of progesterone levels may be indicated. Progesterone also decreases release of substance
P and decreases neurogenic edema.245
Sleep-disordered breathing is more common in men
and postmenopausal women. Progesterone has been associated with a decrease in sleep apnea episodes and can
act as a potent respiratory stimulant to induce sleep.246248
Sleep-disordered breathing in premenopausal women
is also affected by time of menstrual cycle, with fewer
episodes associated with the luteal phase.249

Functions: Testosterone is an anabolic steroid that
is synthesized from cholesterol. Cholesterol is metabolized into pregnenolone, which is converted to either
androstenediol or androstenedione, both of which are
then converted to testosterone. Testosterone is primarily produced by the action of LH on the Leydig cells of
the testis, although small amounts of testosterone are
secreted by the adrenal glands. Testosterone can then be
converted to estradiol or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 5Alpha-reductase is the enzyme that drives the conversion
to DHT, and aromatase is the enzyme that drives the conversion to estradiol (see Figure 10.5). Testosterone has
many positive health associations. It has been shown to

risk of acquiring diabetes threefold.251 Even subtle derangements in testosterone could contribute to metabolic
syndrome and its pathogenesis.251 Testosterone increases
levels of adiponectin, which is inversely correlated with
obesity and insulin resistance.275 Clinical studies have
shown that testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men improved metabolic syndrome indicators and
cardiovascular risk factors.276 A systematic review and
meta-analysis of 30 trials found testosterone use in men
with low testosterone levels did not lead to significant
changes in blood pressure, serum lipids or glucose.277

Other Levels
of Cell Controls

The endocrine system encompasses those tissues
specialized to form products that act on distant tissues through the presence of specific receptors, such as
hormones. Many other levels of cell regulations occur
through products produced within the cell or by nearby
cells. These regulators include cytokines, biochemical
modulators, allosteric feedback regulation, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, translational controls, nitric oxide, eicosanoids and reactive oxygen species. Cytokines
will be reviewed as an example.

others.265 The negative effect of testosterone deficiency
on nitrogen balance and muscle development may be
the major impact of testosterone on nutrient status.
Myopathy has been reported in patients with low testosterone.262, 266 Muscle loss may be reversed by treatment
with testosterone and by assuring amino acid adequacy
(see Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”). Testosterone hormone
replacement therapy is becoming more common.267 A
small double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized
study found long-term low-dose testosterone supplementation (100 mg IM every 2 weeks) on healthy older
men to increase testosterone, nocturnal GH secretions,
morning concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3, and
lower SHBG.268
Although typically people feel concerns about giving higher levels of testosterone because of cancer risk,
a recent study demonstrated that testosterone levels
within normal ranges are not correlated with stimulation, development or growth of prostate cancer cells.
The relationship of testosterone to prostate cancer
showed a bell-shaped distribution. Both extremely low
levels and extremely high levels were associated with the
greatest risk of acquiring prostate cancer.269 It appears
that metabolites of testosterone such as DHT and estrogens may be correlated to prostate cancer risk more than
testosterone itself. Because a prospective study of testosterone replacement therapy and prostate cancer risk
has not been conducted, replacement therapy should be
administered with caution.270
In response to low testosterone levels, the HPA axis
becomes hyperresponsive, and cortisol levels will be abnormally high post-ACTH stimulatory tests.271 Adrenal
output of testosterone contributes to the overall pool,
thus low levels of adrenals will affect adequate levels of
testosterone. Hypothyroidism can impact testosterone
levels as well. An underfunctioning thyroid results in a
low metabolic rate and can lead to a lower testosterone
level. Nutrients such as boron and zinc, and an adequate
supply of arginine and branched-chain amino acids (see
Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”) are associated with adequate
testosterone levels.272, 273
Recent studies have demonstrated that hypogonadism in men may be more prevalent than previously
thought, and is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and may be a risk factor for type-2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. Thus, testosterone may be an independent predictor of insulin resistance and diabetes.274
Studies have shown low testosterone can increase the
Cytokine Signaling Pathways
Cytokines are protein or glycoprotein cell products
that act like hormones in their ability to elicit cellular
responses. Cytokines are produced by a wide variety of cell types and can alter cell function locally or
globally.278–280 Understanding signaling pathways leads
to a broadened awareness of the full range of cellular
control mechanisms. Their importance in explaining cell
controls can be shown in many areas. Research is now
looking at the synergistic effects of hormones and cytokines. One recent study proposed that the interaction of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and proinflammatory cytokines determines the level of sleep/
arousal within the 24-hour cycle in obese adults. The
study found that when cortisol and cytokines were both
elevated, there was a positive association with low sleep
efficiency and fatigue.281 Types of cytokine receptors and
examples of each are shown in Table 10.9. Insulin is
found alongside erythrocyte growth factor and plateletderived growth factor because they all elicit intracellular
action by binding to a protein tyrosine kinase receptor.

Growth hormone inhibition of apoptosis is another
example of cytokine effects. Binding of growth factors to
their protein tyrosine kinase receptors initiates a sequential pathway of phosphorylation reactions as illustrated
in Figure 10.11. Full names for the abbreviations used
in the figure are given in Table 10.10. The transmission
of signals by cytokines is largely by means of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions involving
phosphatidylinositol in cell membranes and serine and
tyrosine residues of cytosolic proteins. The key sequence
in this process is called the AKT signaling pathway
because phosphorylation of AKT initiates multiple additional conversions that directly govern the action of
cell survival or apoptosis. The serine/threonine protein
kinase Akt (or Protein Kinase B) is the cellular homologue of the viral oncogene v-Akt and is activated by
various growth and survival factors. The AKT pathway
has been a focus of investigations of numerous forms
of cancer.282-284 The antifungal antibiotic Wortmannin is
an inhibitor of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase that also
inhibits the growth of mammary tumors.285 In addition
to inhibition of apoptosis, activation of the AKT pathway
signals multiple other metabolic outcomes as summarized in Table 10.11.
The study of cytokines and signaling pathways is
revealing details of molecular events within cells that
determine activities of biosynthesis, response to external
stimuli and cell survival. Tests for cytokine levels are
already being offered by some laboratories for investigative clinical use. Cytokines are highly transient, however,
so their measurement is largely of academic interest
currently. At the current rate of expansion in knowledge

The overall function of this signaling pathway is to mediate
cell survival and growth. Binding of growth hormone to
cell surface receptors induces the production of second
messengers that activate PI3K. PI3K generates PIP3 in
the cell membrane that activates PDK, a kinase that
phosphorylates Thr308 of membrane-bound protein
kinase B (Akt). Akt inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylating
Bad. Phosphorylated Bad causes dissociation of a nuclear
complex, allowing cell survival. Akt phosphorylation of
FKHRL1 and caspase prevents apoptosis. Akt also ultimately
leads to NF-kb activation and cell survival. In the absence
of growth hormone, the Akt -mediated steps subside,
allowing turnover of cells and regression of tumors.

## Specimen Choices

Although there is much confusion over how and
when to test hormones, the necessity of this practice
continues to impress itself on the medical community.
With the advent of recent large-scale hormone trials
showing an increased risk of breast cancer with hormone replacement, it has never been more apparent that
hormone levels need to be tested systematically before
therapy is started and while therapy is being taken to
make sure safe levels are maintained. There are three
primary samples that are used to test hormones: serum,
saliva and urine. All three are viable methods of testing.
Understanding the differences between specimens will
help to direct which is most useful to a particular
clinical question.
Hormone levels as measured in the serum are considered the “gold standard” of hormone testing. However, measurement of serum hormone levels is not without
its limitations. Serum changes more slowly, so the effects
of treatment are not as quickly observable. Without the
intervention of exogenous hormones, serum, salivary
and urine levels are generally highly correlated. Some
studies have shown correlation post-treatment,286, 287
others have not. There are several explanations for the
inability of one specimen type to reflect what is happening globally, and on a tissue level; these include the
routes of delivery and transport of hormones, as well as
the fact that hormones do not equally diffuse to all areas
of the body. Hormone delivery may significantly affect
outcomes. Oral routes of delivery are more susceptible
to a first-pass response. Many practitioners prefer a
transdermal application of hormones because it avoids
hepatic metabolism and poor oral bioavailability, and
minimizes the hypnotic effects of progesterone.288 When
hormones are delivered vaginally, they are less effective
in women who have low estrogenization of tissue.289
Although some studies using transdermal preparations questioned absorption, others found appropriate
increases in serum levels after topical delivery.290 An
example of unequal hormone diffusion was found in a
study in which progesterone was delivered via vaginal
suppositories, and the levels of progesterone were found
to be negligible in the serum, although a tissue biopsy
of the uterus showed an increase in level after treatment.
There are likely two routes of delivery, lymphatic and
RBC, not mirrored by serum, which may explain this
difference. Salivary levels are typically 2 to 5% of serum
steroids.
Sometimes the argument is made that hormone
concentrations measured in saliva more accurately
reflect bioavailable levels because only the free hormone
passes from plasma into saliva. However, some caution
about accepting the concept is warranted. For one thing,
only about 50% of sex hormone in saliva is unbound,
a fact that the method of measurement should take
into account.291 Also, although progesterone changes in
saliva may mirror changes in plasma, the ratio between
the two is altered during the luteal phase, which was
not correlated to changes of unbound hormone in the
serum.292 Free unbound progesterone was reported to
be 53.7% during the proliferative phase, and 41.4% in
the secretory phase.291 Saliva is unreliable if used with
troches unless 24 to 26 hours have elapsed between last
dose and collection of saliva. Other hormones appear

of health and disease, measurement of cytokines in
body fluids may soon find routine clinical relevance as a
tool for guiding therapies, including nutrient interventions. Numerous references have been made in previous
chapters to nutrient-dependent cell regulation events
such as nitric oxide formation, neurotransmitter synthesis and eicosanoid formation from polyunsaturated fatty
acids. Such instances of cell regulation act in concert
with hormone output of endocrine glands to modulate
tissue responses via cytokine pathways. Considering
nutrient-cytokine and nutrient-hormone interactions
should be integrated into the overall process of guiding
patients from disease to health.

Hormone
Replacement Therapy

When hormones such as progesterone are given
orally, serum levels may overestimate true levels. This
is because serum levels may also measure hormone metabolites, especially glucuronides.295 Salivary hormone
testing has been considered to be superior to serum
testing in that salivary levels represent a truer measure
of the tissue delivery potential, uncomplicated by the
partitioning between blood transport components.296
When progesterone is administered to the skin as a topical cream, subsequent serum progesterone levels may
reflect a lower concentration than is present within the
tissue. This is because the lymphatic delivery and RBC
delivery routes of progesterone are not fully detected in
a serum sample. It has been demonstrated that delivery
of hormones from lymph can occur. Hormones will
leave the ovary via the subovarian lymphatic vascular
network as well as through venous blood. If hormones
are delivered through this mechanism, the levels measured in the blood would be incomplete.286 Whole blood
may avoid the largest variable, as RBC hormone would
be considered.
It has been proposed that RBC transports hormones
and delivers them rapidly to capillary beds and tissues.
It is argued that saliva is more reflective of tissue levels

because it is a type of tissue bed. In vitro evidence has
shown that hormones are transported rapidly across the
red cell membrane and that the hormones are extracted
during the capillary transit time, making free plasma
concentration very low. Hormones bind with varying
affinities to the red blood cell. The sequence of binding affinity from low to high is estriol, testosterone,
estrone, estradiol and, finally, progesterone. Seventy to
85% of progesterone exposed to RBCs is taken up by
them.297 The lipophilic steroid sex hormones may bind
to the RBC membrane, and they can traverse the RBC
cell membrane in less than 2 milliseconds.298 These
molecular dynamics suggest that the timing of specimen
collection for exogenously delivered hormones must
be taken into consideration. In a study that compared
saliva, serum and urine samples after the application
of transdermal progesterone cream, progesterone was
not found in the RBC, but it was measured only once,
24 hours after the last application. Because of the high
rate of redistribution, even RBC levels measured within
an hour, may still be too much of a delay to see the
elevation.299 The hypothesis is that most transdermal
progesterone is taken up by RBCs in contrast to in vitro
dialysis studies that have shown progesterone to distribute almost equally between a phosphate buffer dialysate
and red cell membranes.300 Oral progesterone does not
have the same pattern in saliva. In fact, oral progesterone may be underrepresented by salivary levels, whereas
transdermal is extenuated by salivary levels.
Hormones were intended to be a short-term therapy
to provide symptomatic relief during a women’s transition through menopause. They have grown in use and
are now often prescribed long term. Justification for
this long-term use is explained by a potential protective
effect against cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and
Alzheimer’s. Research corroborating the benefit of hormones in these cases is conflicting. Rigorous monitoring
of hormones is required to use them in a manner that is
consistent with the pursuit of optimizing health.

to be reliably tested for in the saliva. The presence of
mixed-function oxygenases in saliva presents another
concern because their activity may alter measured
hormone concentrations; likewise, bacteria in saliva may
affect the levels. Conjugated steroids, that is, steroids
that have gone through sulfation or glycosylation, flow
into the saliva at a significantly slower rate, resulting in a
lower concentration of conjugated steroids.293
Rapid changes are seen in saliva, whereas serum is
more stable. Urinary levels offer another method of testing of hormones. Both active forms and metabolites may
be measured in urine. For example, estrogen conjugates,
estrone glucuronide correlates, and pregnanediol-3glucuronide are major metabolites. Urine levels correlate
with serum samples with a lag time of about 12 to 24
hours.294 The best correlation for estrogens is seen when
concentrations are normalized to creatinine.294 An advantage of urinary levels is that this is the only specimen
by which one can observe a hypersecretion of estrogen.

Notes:

further degraded to quinines that can act on the DNA.
This DNA damage could be increased under conditions
of an impaired sulfation pathway.303 Liver function must
be considered as part of hormone therapy.
The final piece of elimination occurs in the gut.
After conjugation, hormones are water soluble and are
prepared to be excreted. If bowel function is impaired,
hormones can sit in the gut longer, and be reabsorbed.
This results in an increased level of circulating metabolites that may impact health. Also in a state of
dysbiosis, the enzyme β-glucoronidase may be affected.
This relationship is demonstrated by the production of
daidzein from soy and other herbs that are created by
human intestinal bacteria. This metabolite from beneficial gut flora and soy potently inhibits β-glucuronidase.304 β-Glucuronidase will cleave hormones from
their conjugates, resulting in increased reabsorption.
Evidence of the relationship of gut flora to hormones
is seen with research that associates antibiotic use with
breast cancer.305, 306 The disruption on the intestinal
microflora by antibiotic use changes the way estrogen is
eliminated. It also changes the way phytochemicals such
as phytoestrogens and polyphenols are metabolized.
Thus, a patient’s gut flora status may need to be considered when evaluating overall hormone health. Dysbiosis
profiles as discussed in the Chapter 7, “Gastrointestinal
Function,” and Chapter 6, “Organic Acids.”
The interrelationships within the body’s endocrine
system are complex and multifaceted. The most appropriate manner by which to test for specific hormone
levels continues to be an arena of ongoing research. Furthermore, knowing when to test for specific hormone
levels and how to best test for these levels represents
both the art and the science of practicing medicine.

Hormone
Biotransformation
(Detoxification)

Standard menopausal hormone therapy (also
referred to as hormone replacement therapy, HRT) uses
substances that do not match those in the human body.
HRT comes primarily from conjugated equine estrogens.
The Women’s Health Initiative and the Women’s Health
Initiative Memory Study, large epidemiological studies that focused on the effects of HRT, found significant
negative effects for those women using HRT and have
lead to the significant decline in equine hormone use.
Bioidentical hormones, which have been used in Europe
for years, are designed to match the structure and function of hormones produced in the body.234 Bioidentical
estrogens are structurally identical to estrone, estradiol and estriol.301 When any hormones are put into a
system, thought should be given to the body’s ability
to eliminate and metabolize them. If metabolism is not
adequate in both the gut and liver, toxicity and improper
balance will ensue, undermining the goal of health. The
lowest level of a hormone that can be used to lower
symptoms should be used, and care must be given to
make sure the hormone is utilized properly once inside
the system with frequent testing of hormone levels, as
well as hormone metabolites.

Bioidentical Hormones

Hormone metabolites are conjugated by the liver either through glucuronidation, sulfation or methylation.
Liver detoxification is discussed in more detail in the
Chapter 8, “Toxins and Detoxification.” Hormone levels
may be improperly regulated if detoxification pathways
are functioning inadequately. Insufficient amino acid sta- Notes:
tus can alter conjugation. For example, methionine is required for sulfate production to clear circulating thyroid
hormone and to sustain turnover of S-adenosyl-methionine for hydroxyestrogen methylation.302 Other factors
also affect the enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase that
drives glucuronidation. Factors that up-regulate UDPglucuronyl transferase are thyroid hormone, increased
blood sugar, fish oils, limonene-containing foods, dill
weed, caraway and vitamin C. The enzyme is inhibited
by aspirin and probenecid. Sulfation is activated by molybdenum. An underactive sulfation is associated with
carcinogenic estrogen metabolites. Catecholestrogens are
