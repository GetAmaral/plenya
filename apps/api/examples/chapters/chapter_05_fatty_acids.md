## Introduction

Fatty acids and their metabolic effects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including
obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, genetic diseases
such as cystic fibrosis, and autoimmune disorders such
as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.5-19 Attempting to determine the relationship of dietary fatty
acids and cardiovascular disease has been difficult, and
further complicated by the synergistic effect of obesity
and diabetes.20-23 The specific effect of dietary fatty acids
on obesity has also been long-debated.24-32 These three
disorders have been proposed to be related through
chronic inflammation that can be modulated by intake
of EFAs.33-35
Dietary fat intake has also been found to be related to several forms of cancer, though its relationship
is complicated by genetic factors and micronutrient
status.36, 37 Insufficiencies of EFAs were found to increase
morbidity in recovering cancer patients.38 Low serum
triglyceride levels may be a general feature in many
autoimmune disorders,39 and may explain why supplementation of EFA has been shown to be effective in
decreasing symptoms.40, 41
The nervous system, due to its high fatty acid
content and the critical dependence of nerve signal
conduction on membrane status, is highly susceptible
to pathologies of fatty acid deficiency. Lack of EFAs may
contribute to conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

Over the past few decades the relationship between dietary fat and disease has been the subject of
much controversy and confusion. Recognition of the
importance of specific physiological and toxicological
roles for the individual fatty acids that largely constitute
dietary fat has been a significant advance. Health issues
associated with fatty acids are largely traced to modern
dietary habits of low intake for fish, vegetables, whole
grains, nuts, and seeds and high intake for processed
and manufactured dietary fats. Long-term restriction
of total dietary fat exacerbates essential fatty acid (EFA)
insufficiencies and has been related to several disease
conditions, though excess animal fats have been strongly
correlated to increases in chronic diseases. Fatty acid
levels are determined primarily by dietary intake and
genetics, though estrogen levels and parity are factors
that contribute to EFA status among women1, 2, and
variations in testosterone levels have a significant influence on fatty acid status in men.3, 4 In clinical practice
the need for laboratory evaluations of fatty acid status is
helpful for making decisions about dietary modification
and/or supplementation with EFAs and/or other nutrients involved in fatty acid metabolism.
Common abbreviations used in discussing fatty
acids that will be used throughout this chapter are found
in the list following the index in this book.

Fatty Acid Status and Disease

and seizure disorders. The major pathological feature of
AD, increased deposition of amyloid plaques, is preceded by increased lipid peroxidation in animal models.42
Oxidation of neuronal membrane polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFA) can create products that can lead to
neurodegeneration and may serve as biomarkers of AD
in the future.43, 44 Platelet membrane fluidity has been
proposed as an adjunct marker of in vivo AD diagnosis.45
Membrane fatty acid composition affects the function of
neurons by changing membrane fluidity and function,
by altering local signaling by means of eicosanoid/docosanoid synthesis, or by altering gene expression/transcription by means of PPARs.46,19, 47

and cardiolipin. By means of such mechanisms, fatty
acid status determines responses to stimuli; mood; ability to remember, make decisions, and perform calculations; and the coordination of motor function.
Membrane receptors are less exposed to the external
environment as membrane fluidity increases.45 Shortterm (4-week) dietary supplementation of fish oils
altered macrophage membrane fluidity, and decreased
TNF binding affinity, GTPase activity, and cAMP production. After a 4-week period, fluidity was lowest and
highest in animals fed corn and fish oil, respectively. After 8 weeks, there was a general enhancement of cAMP
production, and further differences became apparent.47
These data show the influence of membrane fatty acid
composition on the function of the all-important class
of membrane-resident receptors that modulate neuronal
activity.

Fatty Acid Structure
and Metabolism
Michel Eugène Chevreul (1786–1889), a French
chemist, discovered the first fatty acid while studying
potassium soap made from pig fat. He named several
fatty acids, including oleic, butyric, caproic and capric
acids, and stearic acid. Chevreul also demonstrated
that all fatty acids are composed of a carboxylic acid
(-COOH) with a long carbon tail (4–24 carbon atoms
in length). Additional members of the fatty acid family,
including those that make up human lipids, were gradually identified over the 100 years following Chevreul’s
death. With advancements in chromatographic resolution, additional names and structures were added to this
list of closely related compounds.
There are about 40 physiologically significant fatty
acids, not including derivatives such as hydroxy- and
branched fatty acids. Compared with other classes of
molecules in living cells, fatty acids have simple structures and the variations among them are relatively small.
Those slight structural differences, however, can cause
profoundly different effects on the function of cells. For
example, one 20-carbon fatty acid, arachidonic (AA),
can increase the risk of heart disease, whereas another,
eicosapentaenoic (EPA), which contains a similar straight
chain of 20 carbon atoms, can help prevent it. The
structural difference consists in the simple removal of a
few atoms of hydrogen. The cellular effects arise from

Multiple clinical effects of fatty acids are mediated, at least in part, by means of membrane fluidity
changes.48 In biological membranes, lipids and many
membrane proteins within the bilayer are constantly in
motion. Although bacteria regulate the fluidity of their
membranes by varying the number of double bonds
and the length of their fatty acyl chains, cholesterol is
an additional key regulator of membrane fluidity in animals.49 Pathogeneses of several diseases, such as, cancer,
blindness and numerous behavioral disorders have been
shown to share membrane fluidity components that mediate the activity of protein receptor complexes within
cell membranes.
In the brain, synaptic transmission requires the
fusion of pre-synaptic vesicles with cell membranes
for exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Membrane fusion
is affected by fluidity. In this process vesicular fatty
acids become recycled into the cell membrane for reextraction.50 It is not suprising then that a deficiency of
n-3 fatty acids was found to alter the release of neurotransmitters in the rat brain. Animal studies have also
found that rats fed cis-alpha linolenic acid (ALA), compared to those fed trans- corrected dopamine concentrations in the hippocampus.51 These changes may be due
to the known lowering of membrane fluidity by trans
fatty acid intake.
Mitochondrial membranes are especially susceptible to oxidative damage because of their proximity
to the intense oxygen-radical activity of the electron
transport system. Age associated mitochondrial membrane changes include increases in membrane rigidity,
cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, n-6 fatty acids, and
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and decreases in n-3 fatty acids

## Membrane Fluidity Changes

the vast quantity of fatty acid in the membranes that
surround the cells and subcellular compartments. The
nature of those membranes governs the flow of energy
and information that impacts the functions of cells and
the tissues in which they are comprised. Subtle differences in bond positions can change this flow of energy
and information in a way that determines the progression of major diseases, defines thresholds to pain, and
directs responses of the immune system.

Notes:

The majority of biologically significant fatty acids
have been given common names that are based upon
the individual who discovered the fatty acid (e.g., Mead,
Osbond) or a common food source of the fatty acid
(e.g., oleic in olive oil, vaccenic from the Latin vacca
for cow, as it is found in milk fat).
To more precisely describe fatty acids, naming
conventions have evolved based upon three key features
of fatty acid structure—the number of carbon atoms,
the number of double bonds, and the location of the
double bonds. One such system uses Greek number
descriptors whereby each name begins with the number
of carbon atoms (e.g., octadeca = eighteen) followed by
the number of double bonds (e.g., tri = three). Hence
octadecatrienoic acid describes more precisely a fatty
acid that has eighteen carbon atoms and three double
bonds. To further distinguish between fatty acids that
have that structure, numbers that describe the positions
of the double bonds are prefixed to the Greek descriptors. For example, counting atoms from the carboxyl
end of the fatty acid molecule, ALA has double bonds at

Naming Fatty Acids

positions 9, 12, and 15, and it is described as 9, 12, 15octadecatrienoic acid. Gamma linolenic (GLA) is also an
eighteen-carbon fatty acid with three double bonds, yet
its double bonds are at the 6, 9, and 12 positions, so its
scientific descriptor is 6, 9, 12-octadecatrieonic acid.
This system has been simplified by the substitution of Arabic numerals for the Greek syllables. Hence
octadecatrieonic acid becomes 18:3. The positions of
the double bonds are designated by the delta system,
whereby the Greek letter ∆ is superscripted with the
numbers that specify the position of the double bonds,
again counting the atoms from the carboxyl end of the
molecule. Hence, ALA is written 18:3∆9, 12, 15 and GLA
is 18:3∆6, 9, 12.
An even simpler naming system—the omega
system—identifies the position of the double bonds by
counting the atoms from the methyl end of the molecule. Since, in humans, three carbon atoms always
separate fatty acid double bonds, knowing the position
of the first gives the position of all the others. This naming system uses the Arabic numerals to designate the
number of carbon atoms and double bonds (e.g., 18:3)
followed by ω, w or n (these are synonymous) followed
by the position of the first double bond from the methyl
end of the molecule. Hence, ALA is 18:3n3 and GLA
is 18:3n6. The specificity and simplicity of this system
has made it the most often used fatty acid scientific
nomenclature in recent years. The common names are
still frequently used when the specific descriptors are
not necessary. Families of structurally related, straightchain fatty acids are defined according to the number of
carbons in the chain, such as “short chain” (fewer than

10 atoms), “medium chain” (10 to 14 atoms), “long
chain” (16 to 20 atoms), and “very-long chain” (20 or
more atoms). These families may be abbreviated as
SCFA, MCFA, LCFA and VLCFA, respectively.

In most naturally occurring fatty acids the carbon
atoms on either side of a double bond are on the same
side of the molecule (cis-geometry). Trans fatty acids
represent a special group of molecules wherein the
carbon atoms are on opposite sides of the molecule
(trans-geometry) . Most of these are not found in nature
and result from the man-made process of chemical hydrogenation of plant-based oils. This causes their shape
and function to be similar to the straight-chained saturated fatty acids. The omega nomenclature system uses
a “t” to designate a trans fat. Hence, 18:1t-n7 indicates
that the single double bond at the omega-7 position is in
the trans- configuration. This is the formula for elaidic
acid, the most abundant trans-fatty acid in most dietary
hydrogenated oils.

## Grouping Based on Double Bonds

Using the omega system, the polyunsaturates are
grouped according to the position of the first double
bond. Hence the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 fatty acids)
share the structural characteristics of having the first
double bond begin at the third atom from the methyl
end of the molecule; omega-6 (n-6 fatty acid) at the
sixth atom; and omega-9 (n-9 fatty acid) at the ninth
atom. The monounsaturates have only one double bond.
Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds; their carbon
atoms are in straight chains and, as a result, can be
packed together very tightly, allowing living organisms
to store chemical energy very densely. Odd-numbered
fatty acids are also saturated. Figure 5.1 reviews the
naming conventions of unsaturated fatty acids.

Control of Fatty Acid
Supply and Distribution
ω

∆

Fatty acids are present in the diet in the form of
triglycerides in solid fats or liquid oils, and as phosphatides in the cell membranes of whole foods. They are
rarely present in nature in the form of free fatty acids.
Bile acids carry out the first phase in digestion of
dietary fat by causing the dispersal of particles of fatty
tissue or dietary oils into fine droplets. Lipase enzymes
then break the ester bonds releasing glycerol and free
fatty acids that pass into intestinal epithelial cells along
with cholesterol. The enterocytes re-esterify them, forming triglycerides that are associated with proteins to
form chylomicrons (see Figure 5.2). The chylomicrons
are passed into the lymphatic system to flow directly
through the heart into systemic circulation without
action by hepatic enzymes. Enzymes present in capillary cell walls cause the transfer of fatty acids from the
chylomicrons, which, after undergoing a great reduction
in size, return for uptake by the liver as chylomicron
remnants.
Because of their critical life-support function in
forming cell membranes and in supplying energy sources and hormone controls, there are mechanisms for assuring that the supply of fatty acids will be continuous,
even during short intervals between meals. In the fasting
state, fatty acids are mobilized from adipose stores or are
pro­duced from either carbohydrate or protein. The liver
handles the role of supply depot by forming the class
of lipid-protein particles called VLDL. These particles
deliver fatty acids and cholesterol to the tissues by
mechanisms similar to those for chylo­microns, except

that the entire remnant of LDL particles is taken up by
binding to receptor sites on extrahepatic cell surfaces.
By ensuring a constant supply of fatty acids, the body
controls material that is most critical in carrying out the
various life-sustaining functions of growth and repair. In
pregnant women, for example, maternal red cells may
serve as a reservoir of AA and DHA (docosahexaenoic)
for utilization by the developing fetus.52

Though a small but significant fraction of fatty acids
are present in plasma in the unesterified, or free form,
bound to albumin, the majority of fatty acids are in the
esterified form in lipoproteins. When fatty acid profiles
are measured on plasma specimens, the results primarily
reflect the fatty acid composition of lipoproteins. Since
serum triglyceride measurements also reflect the total
lipoprotein triglyceride content, there is a significant

Figure 5.2 — Hepatocyte Regulation of Blood Lipids
In the postprandial state (A), fatty acids are cleared from blood by hepatocyte receptors that bind chylomicron remnants.
Simple sugars (glucose, fructose) are simultaneously cleared, supplying carbon for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. During
the fasting state (B), blood levels of lipoproteins are sustained by fatty acid synthesis and export from the endoplasmic
reticulum. Meanwhile, the hepatocyte derives energy from peroxisomal and mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids (C). Before
entering mitochondria, very long chain fatty acids first undergo chain-shortening in peroxisomes or via the mitochondrial
inner membrane cycle depicted in Figure 5.4.

relationship between triglyceride and total plasma fatty
acid levels. The primary endogenously synthesized fatty
acid, palmitic acid, is most strongly associated with
serum triglycerides, as shown in Figure 5.3. From the
regression line, the following formula can be constructed
for estimating serum triglyceride values from plasma
palmitate:

regulatory factors resulting in constant variation in
the number of organelles available for processing fatty
acids. Specific steps in fatty acid metabolism occur in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas others require
movement of fatty acids into microsomes or peroxisomes. In many tissues, the cellular contents of both
of the ER and the peroxisomes are highly variable. In
response to changes in demand for fatty acid metabolism, hepatic ER can double in surface area within a few
days.53 Peroxisomal metabolism is of such importance
that it constitutes a separate field of study in which concepts of nuclear regulation must be invoked in order to
explain the effects. Factors involved in the proliferation
of peroxisomes are discussed below.

Hypertriglyceridemia is related to endogenous fatty acid
synthesis and clearance. As the principal product of the
fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, palmitate represents
endogenous synthesis, and the level of palmitate in
plasma reflects serum triglyceride levels. The trend line
shows a strong linear relationship.

## Fatty Acid Metabolism
The center of total body fatty acid regulation is
the liver, where the balance of fatty acid import, export
and biosynthesis is constantly shifting as the cycle of
eating and fasting causes the rising and falling of dietary
lipid levels in portal blood. In order to assure constant
delivery of blood lipids and to take advantage of energy
surplus, activities of enzymes for fatty acid oxidation
or synthesis are alternately stimulated and inhibited to
accommodate the shifting demands. Fatty acid metabolism involves free fatty acid interconversions, membrane
phospholipid dynamics, and multiple organelle activities
that are under complex control by nuclear regulatory
sites. Rates of protein synthesis are adjusted by nuclear
Fatty acids that arrive at tissue sites in blood
lipoproteins or as free fatty acids bound to albumin
must first be transported across cell and mitochondrial
membranes before they can enter the sequence of reactions that produces ATP, with oxidation of the fatty acid
structures to carbon dioxide and water. Cell membranebound transport proteins, along with carnitine, are
required to move long-chain fatty acids into the cell,
whereas medium-chain fatty acids may diffuse to cell interiors (Figure 5.4). Both medium- and long-chain fatty
acids must be esterified to coenzyme A before mitochondrial entry can occur. Before entering the primary spiral
oxidation pathway, long-chain fatty acids are shortened
to lengths below C14 by inner membrane-resident enzymes that bind only the long-chain fatty acyl carnitine
esters. Once shortened, the fatty acids are passed to the
final degradation pathway that ends when the final four
carbon atoms are split into two acetyl-CoA molecules,
ready for citric acid cycle processing.
This chain length dependent metabolic system
leads to multiple molecular origins of clinical symptoms
deriving from failure to oxidize fatty acids. Disruptions
tend to produce symptoms such as excessive fatigue on
exertion, weakness, or myoglobinuria. Carnitine insufficiency affects all families of fatty acids, generating energy
deficits affecting all organs, though symptoms tend to
appear in the energy-demanding skeletal muscles. A
childhood form called myopathic carnitine deficiency
produces generalized limb weakness, sometimes involving limb, trunk, and facial muscles.54 Medium-chain acyl
transferase deficiency diseases are discussed in the section on genetic disorders in this chapter. Polymorphism

Serum Triglycerides (mg/dl)

in the long-chain fatty acid transport proteins causes
interference with this specific class. These patients
are managed with low-fat diets supplemented with
medium-chain triglycerides to bypass the transporter
requirement.55 Finally, the very-long-chain fatty acids
are handled by a third set of transformations involving
peroxisomal enzymes as discussed later in this chapter.

## Elongation and Desaturation
Fatty acids can be modified by desaturation enzymes that introduce double bonds, and are lengthened
by elongation reactions that add 2-carbon units to the

Figure 5.4 — Intracellular Fatty Acid Transport and Oxidation

Plasma carnitine gains entry to cells via a specific carnitine transport protein (CTp). The carnitine cycle (A) that operates
in the trans-membrane space causes formation and breakage of fatty acyl carnitine. Acylcarnitine synthetase (AS) catalyzes
the attachment of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. Then the translocase enzyme (TL) acts as a gate keeper for entry of LCFAs
passing them to enzymes attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane. There, the inner membrane cycle (B) carries out
two-carbon chain length reductions, producing acetyl-CoA with each chain-length reduction. When the chain length drops
below 14, the fatty acyl-CoA product enters the beta oxidation cycle (C) carried out by acyl dehydrogenase (AD), enoyl
hydratase (EH), hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase (HD) and ketoacyl thiolase (KT) enzymes. The riboflavin-dependent step is
carried out by the FAD-requiring enzyme, AD. Medium chain fatty acids do not require the carnitine cycle since their chain
length allows them to enter the b-oxidation cycle directly as acyl-CoA esters.
Fatty acid Transport: Activation of long-chain fatty acids and their transport into the transmembrane space is done
via long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (AS) located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM).290 Once inside the
transmembrane space they cannot readily traverse the inner mitochondrial membrane and must be coupled to carnitine.
The carnitine cycle (A) causes formation and breakage of fatty acyl carnitine. Carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (TL) shuttles
the acylcarnitine through the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), where enzymes located on the matrix side of the
membrane couple the acyl moiety to carnitine and regenerates acyl-CoA. Medium-chain fatty acids do not require such
transport for mitochondrial import. They are attached to CoA and passed directly into the mitochondrial matrix via mediumchain acyl-CoA synthetases (AS).291
Fatty acid Oxidation: (B) Long-chain fatty acid oxidation takes place in the inner membrane-bound complex, and carries out
two-carbon chain length reductions, producing acetyl-CoA with each chain-length reduction. When the chain length drops
below 14, the acyl-CoAs are further oxidized by the specific enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix system. (C) Medium- and
short-chain fatty acids are degradaded in the matrix system.292-294 β-Oxidation degrades fatty acids completely to acetyl-CoA,
which is then oxidized by the citric acid cycle or, during starvation, condensed into ketone bodies.

The 9-carbon-atom maximum span from carboxyl
group to the position of insertion of a double bond is
achieved by ∆9 desaturase (∆9d). Counting from the other end, the position varies, depending on the length of
the fatty acid. Thus, from stearic acid with its 18 carbon
atoms, ∆9 desaturation forms oleic acid with a double
bond 9 carbon atoms from the carboxyl end, which is
also 9 carbon atoms from the methyl end (18 – 9 = 9).
Figure 5.6 illustrates the action of ∆9d enzymes on
several monounsaturated fatty acids. However, ∆9 desaturation of palmitic acid (16:0) yields palmitoleic acid

carboxyl end. Alternating desaturation and elongation
sequences produce families of products derived from
a common precursor. Linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n6) is
desaturated to form GLA (18:3n6), which may then be
lengthened (elongated) by two carbon atoms to form
DGLA (20:3n6). DGLA can then be further desaturated
to form AA (20:4n6) (see Figure 5.5). The n-6 and n-3
classes of fatty acids must be provided from dietary
PUFAs as precursors for desaturation and elongation
sequences. ALA (C18:3n3) and LA (C18:2n6) are considered dietary EFAs.
Members of the PUFA classes cannot be interchanged because the position of the double bond that
defines them, n-3 or n-6, cannot be modified by human
enzymes. The desaturation and elongation reactions can
be repeated in various combinations, giving an array
of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids for use in the
essential functions of tissue maintenance. The sequence
of reactions used to convert LA into AA is shown in
Figure 5.5.
The enzymes used in saturated fatty acid biosynthesis and those used in their subsequent elongations are
similar in their activities. Fatty acid elongation enzymes
are membrane bound, localized on the outer surface
of the endoplasmic reticulum. In elongation steps, two
carbon atoms are introduced at the carboxyl end of a
fatty acid by the condensation of a fatty acyl-CoA with
acetyl or malonyl-CoA. The product is a β-keto chain
that is longer by two carbon atoms. A three-step process
of reduction and dehydration reactions converts the keto
group to a methylene (-CH2-) group to yield the final
elongated product. Yeast mutants lacking the elongase
system gene have reduced VLCFA (very long chain fatty
acid) synthesis along with the accumulation of mediumchain membrane phospholipid classes.56

After attachment to coenzyme A, a double bond is
inserted at the Δ6 position of linoleic acid to form
γ-linoleic acid (GLA). The elongase system adds a
two-carbon unit at the carboxyl end, and another
desaturation step inserts the fourth double bond at
the Δ5 position to form arachidonic acid. All metabolic

The desaturase enzyme can operate on fatty acids of
various chain lengths, placing double bonds up to nine
carbons away from the carboxyl group. The first carbon
atoms in the double bonds are at varying positions from
the methyl ends of the monounsaturated fatty acid
products resulting in the various n designations. Note
that the n and omega (ω) designations (not shown) are
synonymous. While other nutrients can affect changes
in desaturation rates, the desaturase enzyme directly
requires only the niacin-derived NADH and zinc. Of
these, the relatively loosely bound zinc is far more likely
to become the rate-limiting factor.

Figure 5.6 — Desaturation of Saturated Fatty Acids

The activities of the desaturase enzymes are critical
for maintaining the ratio of saturated and unsaturated
components in cell membranes. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of various chain lengths can be acted on
by this enzyme. Coenzyme A (derived from pantothenic
acid) is used as a carrier for all of these reactions. Since
the properties of the human desaturase enzymes will not
allow insertion further than 9 carbon atoms from the
carboxyl group (∆9), LA (∆9,12) and ALA (∆9,12,15) cannot
be synthesized in humans.
Foods vary greatly in their content of PUFAs (see
Table 5.3). The n-6 fatty acid family is abundant in
vegetable seed oils, whereas the n-3 family is high in
seafood and in vegetable leaves and modest in soybean
oil.57 Although modern diets tend to contain few foods
with appreciable ALA content, they are high in LA from
corn oil used for frying. Other common fat sources
contain largely saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids.
Foods that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty
acids include butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, dairy
products, and meat. Saturated fatty acids are the main
dietary culprit in the elevation of blood cholesterol.

They have higher energy or caloric yield than corresponding unsaturated fatty acids. In a diet that supplies
adequate LA and ALA, they may be used as precursors
to form the longer chain-length PUFAs.
The ∆6d enzyme, acts as a gateway for the flow
of fatty acids through the desaturation and elongation
pathway. Although it can act on any long-chain fatty
acid, the substrate binding affinity increases greatly with
the number of double bonds. Thus, ALA (18:3) binds
stronger than LA (18:2), which in turn binds stronger
than oleic acid (18:1). Thus, individuals eating diets
with high levels of ALA and LA will have adequate
amounts of the downstream fatty acids, AA (20:4) and
EPA (20:5). Although intake of oleic acid may be significantly higher than the PUFAs, it is slowly converted into
20:3n9 (mead acid). When the essential fatty acids are
deficient, however, mead acid accumulates because the
desaturase is free to act on oleic acid. Figure 5.7 shows
how the operations of the enzyme systems produce
families of fatty acids from common precursors and the
competition for the desaturase enzymes.

For fatty acids containing 18 or more carbon atoms,
human enzymes cannot insert double bonds in the n6
or n3 positions, but they can elongate or desaturate at
Δ5 and Δ6. The sequences of reactions produce families
of fatty acids of chain lengths of 18 to 20 carbons
containing one to six double bonds. The position of the
first double bond from the methyl end defines the family
of each product as n9, n6, or n3. Linolenic, linoleic,
and oleic acids compete for the active site of desaturase
enzymes in decreasing order of binding affinity.

dominant site of fatty acid oxidation in many tissues.
Very-long-chain fatty acids (those containing more than
about 20 carbon atoms) are degraded only in peroxisomes in mammalian cells. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation
is required to shorten very-long-chain fatty acids so that
they can be degraded in the mitochondrion.

Figure 5.8 — Peroxisomal Fatty Acid Oxidases

Peroxisomes do not contain the elaborate electron
transfer system for capture of energy released with large
shifts in oxidation potential. Peroxisomal oxidases transfer
electrons directly to molecular oxygen, forming hydrogen
peroxide (and subsequent free radicals). The fatty acid is
shortened by two carbons as a new acetyl-CoA molecule
is released. The hydrogen peroxide byproduct must be
converted to water and oxygen by catalase.

In the discussion of fatty acid metabolism, it is
necessary to consider the movement of fatty acids between organelles. The fatty acid synthase system, along
with the desaturase and elongase enzymes is located
in or on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
microsomes. The conversion of EPA to DHA, however,
requires additional enzymes that are present only in
peroxisomes. For this conversion, EPA must undergo
two further elongation steps before the final ∆6d step can
occur, yielding 24:6n3. This very-long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acid is then transported to the peroxisome. There, a β-oxidation sequence occurs, removing
two carbon atoms from the carboxyl end of 24:6n3 to
finally produce 22:6n3, DHA. In the liver, peroxisomal
DHA must be reintroduced to the ER for packaging and
export with LDL.
Peroxisomal oxidation was first observed in experiments with the blood lipid lowering drug, clofibrate.
These experiments showed that rats treated with clofibrate exhibited an increased rate of fatty acid oxidation and a large increase in the number of peroxisomes
in their liver cells.61 Subsequent work demonstrated
that peroxisomes, as well as mitochondria, can oxidize
fatty acids. In fact, peroxisomes now appear to be the

Peroxisomal
Oxidases

Desaturation enzymes can be affected by many
conditions. Delta-6 desaturase enzymes require a zinc
ion for activity. Therefore, in a patient with low EPA,
adding ALA-rich flax oil will do little good if there is
a zinc deficiency. The changes in body growth, organ
weight, and lipid concentrations of plasma and liver
produced by zinc deficiency are reversed by addition of
ALA, as contained in primrose oil, but not by addition
of LA, as contained in safflower oil,58 illustrating the role
of zinc in the ∆6d enzyme that inserts the extra double
bond between carbon atoms 6 and 7 of linoleic acid.
This enzyme is also inhib­ited by magnesium deficiency,
elevated insulin, and high concentrations of saturated,
monounsaturated, and trans-fatty acids. Trans-fatty
acids, in competing for the binding site on the enzyme,
yield prod­ucts that are of less significance to the cell.
The metabolism of PUFAs is also affected by vitamin
B6 deficiency, the most pronounced effect being a decrease in the production of DHA.59, 60 Mice made vitamin
B6 deficient and fed a diet high in ALA show impaired
activity of ∆6 dehydrogenase and of acyl-CoA oxidase,
which is a gateway to peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation.

In contrast to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation,
peroxisomes contain enzymes that use molecular oxygen
as an electron acceptor, forming hydrogen peroxide,
which is then degraded by catalase (see Figure 5.8). Although the enzymes of peroxisomal degradation of fatty
acids are similar to those found in mitochondria, peroxisomes lack the electron transport chain. In peroxisomes,
electrons from the FADH2 and NADH produced during
the oxidation of fatty acids are immediately transferred
to O2, forming H2O2. To prevent the toxic effects of
H2O2 from causing oxidative degradation of peroxisomal
and cytosolic enzymes, catalase quickly decomposes it
to H2O and O2. Without an electron transport chain,
peroxisomes cannot link the oxidation of fatty acids to
ATP formation, and the released energy is converted to
heat. The acetyl-CoA produced is transported away from
peroxisomes for synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and
other metabolites.
The ability of fatty acids to move from endoplasmic reticulum to peroxisomal compartments provides
an explanation of the sluggishness of conversion of
ALA into DHA. The sequence of desaturation and
elongation repeats in a staggered fashion, because the
double bonds must be inserted at every third carbon,

include enlarged liver, high levels of iron and copper
in the blood, and vision disturbances. In patients with
Zellweger syndrome, peroxisomal retro-conversion
of 24:6n3 to 22:6n3 (DHA) is deficient in cultured
fibroblast,62 and DHA and other desaturation fatty acid
products are deficient.63
Because of the multiorganelle passage requirement,
the rate of conversion from ALA to DHA in human hepatocytes is much lower than that of conversion from ALA
to EPA. This disparity provides an explanation for the
failure to observe a significant rise in DHA in pregnant
and lactating women who are supplemented with ALA,
even though their EPA rises in parallel to their plasma
ALA.64 This situation may not prevail throughout mammalian species, since ALA was found equally effective as
DHA supplementation for raising brain DHA in Wistar
rats.65 The subject has enjoyed a high level of research

whereas the elongation always adds two carbon atoms.
This mismatch of positioning explains why two different desaturase enzymes, ∆5d and ∆6d are required to
generate EPA from ALA. To further convert EPA to DHA
with a similar pair of elongation and desaturation steps,
however, would require a ∆4desaturase. Such an enzyme
was presumed to exist for many years, and the elongation sequence in earlier books indicates a ∆4d step. More
recent evidence indicates that human hepatocytes show
negligible, if any, ∆4d activity. Formation of DHA from
EPA requires, rather, a multistep process, as illustrated
in Figure 5.9. The rate of conversion is greatly slowed
by the requirement of transfer between the endoplasmic
reticulum and the peroxisome.
Lack of peroxisomes or peroxisomal enzymes is
a characteristic feature of Zellweger syndrome, a rare
hereditary disorder affecting infants. Clinical features

Since there is no appreciable Δ4d activity in human endoplasmic reticular compartments, the final desaturation to DHA can
not be done by a simple elongation and desaturation because the double bond would have to be inserted at the number
four carbon. The available Δ6d will do the job, but only after two elongation steps move the carboxyl group out by four more
carbons. Then the product is two carbons too long, so it must be exported to the peroxisome where chain shortening can
occur. In order to contribute to blood lipids, the resulting DHA must be passed back into the endoplasmic export system.

with saturated fatty acids in the 1-position are called
lysophosphatides. The unsaturated fatty acids liberated
from the 2-position may move into either the plasma
fatty acid pool or the intracellular pool available for the
metabolic actions described below. When PLA2 activities
are linked with those of acyltransferases, a trafficking of
fatty acids known as the “deacylation-reacylation cycle”
occurs. The shifting of this dynamic balance produces
waves of increasing or decreasing flow from membrane
phosphatides to COX and LOX enzyme systems for signaling functions. Since the release of fatty acids from the
2-position of phosphatides is necessary for the formation
of eicosanoids, agents that regulate their activities are of
great interest to anti-inflammatory drug development.
There are more than 19 different isoforms of PLA2
in the mammalian system, but recent studies have focused on three major groups, namely, group IV cytosolic
PLA2, group II secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), and group VI
Ca(2+)-independent PLA2. By means of these PLA2s,
the release of AA and the synthesis of eicosanoids are
linked with receptor agonists, oxidative agents, and proinflammatory cytokines involved in a complex network
of signaling pathways.71 Natural modulators of PLA2
activity include angiotensin (stimulation), bradykinin
(inhibition), epinephrine, and thrombin.72-75Abnormal
PLA2 activities have been implicated in the pathology
of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including
cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer’s disease, and neuronal
injury due to excitotoxic agents. Group I, II, IV, V, and
VI PLAL2 have been shown to be constitutive enzymes
of spinal cord.76 Using an astrocytoma cell line, inflammatory/injury stimuli have been shown to activate PLA2
in the brain, initiating the AA cascade.77 Unique catecholamine actions in cardiac tissue are also modulated
by means of the PLA2 release of fatty acids.78

attention because of the critical need for DHA in early
childhood central nervous system development.46, 66
The peroxisome also serves as the site for synthesis
of a special class of phospholipids called plasmalogens. Plasmalogens, rich in the membranes of the CNS,
exhibit two unique structural features: (1) attachment
to the 1-position of glycerol occurs by means of ether
bonds instead of ester bonds, and (2) insertion of a
double bond at carbon ∆2. The juxtaposition of a double
bond immediately next to the ether linkage produces a
form of rigid geometry that protrudes from membrane
surfaces and that confers increased adherence properties
when two cell membranes are adjacent.67
Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and desaturation,
therefore, plays a large role in metabolism of fatty acids
important to the nervous system. In addition, hepatic
peroxisomes are involved in synthesis of bile acids,
cholesterol, and plasmalogens, as well as in metabolism
of amino acids and purines. Numerous genetic disorders
with neurological consequences result from defects in
peroxisomal enzymes or in regulation of peroxisomal
proliferation.68 The abnormalities in fatty acids detected
by laboratory profiles of plasma or red blood cells can
detect many such disorders.69 In a much broader sense,
the effect of nutritional status and toxicant exposure on
peroxisomal regulation may be of significance in many
of the major chronic diseases such as the metabolic
syndrome.70

Phosphatides, Phospholipases,
and Membrane Turnover

The dominant form of fatty acids in living organisms is the phospholipid, in which two fatty acids and
a polar “head” group are attached to a molecule of
glycerol. These compounds are collectively known as
phosphatides, and they are the basic structural unit of
cell membranes. Substrate specificity for the esterase
enzymes that form the fatty acyl glycerol ester bonds
results in saturated fatty acids predominantly in the 1position, and unsaturated fatty acids in the 2-position.
The membrane composition of phosphatides is constantly changing as a result of the action of phospholipase enzymes. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a membranebound complex that extracts fatty acids from the middle
or 2-position of phosphatides. The actions of two
different forms of this enzyme cause a dynamic circulation of fatty acids from both the inner and outer layers
of membranes. The resulting phosphomonoglycerides

Notes:

The shift of modern diets away from high PUFA
intakes, specifically n-3 fatty acids, is thought to be a
primary contributor to the metabolic and hormonal factors impacting fatty acid desaturase and PLA enzymes,
leading to peroxisome plasticity.

Eicosanoids — The overall function of the desaturation and elongation sequence is to maintain levels of
DGLA, AA, and EPA for incorporation into biological
membranes. These three PUFAs are the parent compounds of the 1-, 2-, and 3-series prostanoid (prostaglandin and thromboxane) and leukotriene pathways.
The derivatives are collectively called “eicosanoids”
(from the Greek eikosa, meaning twenty) because they
all contain 20 carbon atoms. Eicosanoids may carry
out extremely potent biological activities, including
regulation of blood vessel leakage, lipid accumulation,
immune cell behavior, and contribution to the initiation
and progress of heart and blood vessel disease.79 Eicosanoids show effects in amplifying and balancing signals

## PUFA-Derived Cell Regulation Products

to the brain, in the blood clotting system, and in the
immune system. Various cytokines initiate the sequence
by eliciting local cell response through a process starting
in the cell membrane of affected cells. These various
stimuli cause phospholipase A2 to cleave fatty acids
(mainly AA) from the 2-position of membrane phosphodiglycerides (see Figure 5.10). Lipoxygenase and
cyclooxygenase enzymes within the cell then convert the
released DGLA, AA, and EPA into the various classes of
eicosanoids. Leukotrienes, lipoxins, and prostaglandins
are classes of eicosanoids within which are the subclasses, called series 1, 2, and 3, defined by the number
of double bonds they possess. Note that the number of
double bonds in the parent fatty acid always exceeds by
two the number of double bonds present in the products
indicated by their respective 1, 2, or 3 subscripts. Thus,
PGE1, PGE2 and PGE3, though similar compounds, differ in that they possess 1, 2, or 3 double bonds, because
they are derived from fatty acids containing 3, 4, or
5 double bonds. Two of the fatty acid double bonds are
lost in the formation of the derivatives by the enzymes.
Prostaglandins are pivotal in many primary functions.
For example, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is uniquely important in sleep, as shown in studies where REM sleep is
totally abolished by inhibitors of PDG2 formation.80 This
2-series prostaglandin is formed from AA. Thus sleep
requires adequate nerve membrane AA for extraction by
PLA2 to supply the cyclooxygenase pathway.
The parent PUFAs, DGLA, AA, and EPA are processed by the same enzyme for all three series of products. The simple concentrations of the three fatty acids
present in the cell membrane thus determine which
products will predominate. Membrane composition, in
turn, is determined by dietary intake and the desaturation and elongation reactions that we have described.
The lipoxygenase enzyme initiates the sequence of
reactions leading to leukotriene formation (Figure 5.11).
The 2-series that is derived from AA is by far the most
pro-inflammatory. Antagonism of AA by DGLA and EPA
for active sites of lipoxygenases moderates inflammatory
responses because the 1-series and 3-series leukotrienes
are much less inflammatory than those of the 2-series.
The anti-inflammatory effects of DGLA and EPA on
rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases are mediated by
means of this mechanism. They bind to the lipoxygenase
in place of AA and stimulate the production of the series
1 (DGLA) and series 3 (EPA) eicosanoids. Dietary fatty
acid intake is a primary determinant of flow through this

the two-positions, releasing the fatty acids to be acted
upon by lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX)

Endocannabinoids — Endocannabinoids are
endogenous metabolites capable of activating cannabinoid receptors. The CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor
subtypes are involved in nervous and immune disorders, cardiovascular disease, pain, inflammation, and
cancer. Both types of receptors are G-protein-coupled
membrane-bound functional proteins. CB1 receptors are
found in the central nervous system and in a variety of
other organs, including the heart, vascular endothelium,
uterus, vas deferens, testis, and small intestine.82 Within

the first few minutes of high-frequency stimulation of
glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses, CB1 activation
by endocannabinoids is necessary for long-term synaptic depression and recovery.83 CB2 receptors appear
to be associated exclusively with the immune system.
The endocannabinoids interact with known regulators
of appetite and weight gain. The interactions occur in
the limbic system, hypothalamus, intestinal system, and
adipose tissue. Various pharmacological and dietary
approaches are under study in the pursuit of improved
treatments for cachexia and malnutrition associated
with cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and
anorexia nervosa.84
The most active endocannabinoids have the arachidonoyl chain attached to either ethanolamine or glycerol. Arachidonylethanolamide (Anandamide or AEA)
and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have been reported
to have neuromodulator or neurotransmitter properties.85 Hypothalamic regulation of visceral processes
(e.g., food intake, thermoregulation, and control of
anterior pituitary secretion) is modulated by endocan-

pathway. This mechanism helps to explain many of the
links between the balance of specific fats in the diet and
long-term health maintenance.81 Eating a diet rich in fish
oils shifts the dynamic equilibrium toward less inflammatory responses. Routine laboratory profiles of fatty acids in plasma or erythrocytes allow specific intervention
in cases in which the imbalance is most prevalent, so
that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses
are kept in balance and other local control processes
respond properly to cellular stress.

Eicosanoid products of COX and LOX enzymes help maintain the balance of tissue responses to stress signals. The series-1, -2,
and -3 products are defined by the number of double bonds they contain. Prostaglandin formation causes loss of two double
bonds, so the products of DGLA, AA, and EPA contain 1, 2, or 3 double bonds, respectively. These numbers become the

inversely correlated with fish intake.93 The latest data
on Rimonabant efficacy indicate that the drug-induced
weight loss is quickly regained if the drug is discontinued after a year, indicating that it would need to be
used chronically to maintain weight loss.92 Furthermore,
onset of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central
nervous system in which the nerves undergo progressive
demyelination, has been observed within several months
of starting the cannabinoid receptor antagonist.94 These
data suggest that the cannabinoid system might indeed
be relevant to disease pathogenesis in MS. Finally, any
conclusion as to the impact of drugs that might be used
by large numbers of women before and during pregnancy must take perinatal effects into consideration, since
endocannabinoids regulate embryonal implantation and
neonate feeding, appetite, and neuroprotection.95

The Fat-Sensing System:
Peroxisome Plasticity

In order to accommodate the heavy baseline flux
and large fluctuations in the supply of fatty acids,
powerful regulatory mechanisms must act to adjust
their use and storage. A primary method of responding
to changes in fatty acid intake consists of changing the
number of peroxisomes available for metabolic processing. Peroxisomes are eukaryotic organelles within the
cell that function in the metabolism of fatty acids, to
help rid the cell of toxic peroxides, and provide other
essential metabolic functions. Peroxisomes proliferate
or decrease in response to dietary lipids, hormones, toxicants, and drugs that bind to nuclear regulatory proteins
called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)
proteins. Similar to other nuclear hormone receptors,
PPARs acts as ligand-activated transcription factors. The
PPAR response provides a mechanism whereby lipogenic
enzyme gene expression is strongly suppressed by small
additions of dietary PUFAs.96
Three varieties of PPAR, α, δ (previously β), and
γ, are distributed among various tissues. Unsaturated
fatty acids bind to PPAR-α primarily in the liver, heart,
muscle, and kidney, activating genes involved in fatty
acid uptake, mitochondrial and peroxisomal transport,
beta-oxidation, and cytochrome P450 omega-oxidation.
During long-term fasting, the free fatty acids that are
mobilized from adipose tissue bind to PPAR-α, enhancing hepatic fatty acid oxidation and the production of
ketone bodies, averting hypoglycemia.97 This difference between fatty acids released from adipose tissue

nabinoids by means of CB1 receptors. Administration
of anandamide to rats decreases hypothalamic release of
leutenizing hormone and prolactin, causing prolongation of pregnancy and delayed lactation.86
Phospholipids containing AA at the 2-position
undergo sequential hydrolysis of the 1-fatty acid and
the 3-phosphate group to yield 2-AG. In mice, n-3 fatty
acid deficiency elevates, and n-3 fatty acid enrichment
reduces 2-AG levels in brain.87 These results suggest that
the physiological and pathological effects of 2-AG on the
CNS could be modified by manipulation of dietary n-3
fatty acid status. Other evidence indicates that this class
of endocannabinoid also includes the analogous compounds produced from the 22-carbon PUFA, DHA.88
Both arachidonoyl and docosahexacosanoyl forms have
been detected in the retina.89 These finding are significant because of the very high concentrations of DHA in
the healthy brain and especially retinal tissue. Thus low
n-3 fatty acid levels detected in plasma or erythrocytes
may have significant effects in the CNS.
The pharmaceutical industry is keenly interested
in endocannabinoid-mimicking drugs because of the
potential for weight reduction. Since both cannabis and
2-AG stimulate appetite and increase visceral adiposity, the possibility of causing weight loss with a drug
that inhibits such stimulation was explored. The drug
Rimonabant was discovered to have powerful CB1
inhibitory properties. It not only induced weight loss,
but simultaneously caused a lowering of nicotine effects, helping smokers to stop the habit.90 The drug,
also known as SR 141716, suppresses the reinforcing/
rewarding properties of cocaine, heroin, nicotine, and alcohol in laboratory rodents.91 As might be expected with
such pharmacologic-induced inhibitions of fundamental
cell regulatory systems, such drugs were found to cause
significant side effects. After the first year of use, 1 out
of 8 patients reported significant depression, anxiety,
and nausea.92 Such side effects are not surprising when
a system that helps to regulate pleasure, relaxation, and
pain tolerance is suppressed. Even though tolerance for
potential side effects might be justified in view of the
rapidly rising incidence of obesity, CB1-inhibiting drugs
may be no more effective than the counteracting of
appetite and fat cell proliferation by endocannabinoids
derived from EPA and DHA. Data regarding the much
lower incidence of obesity in Iceland compared with
the United States provide evidence in support of such
an argument. The obesity rates in the two countries are

unsaturated fatty acids activate all three classes, most
studies have dealt with their effects mediated through
PPAR-α.
Responses to PPAR activation are further modified
by a mechanism involving coactivation of similar receptors by different ligands. Since a pair of receptor-ligand
receptors is required, the functional unit of regulation is
called a heterodimer. The vitamin A derivative, 9-cisretinoic acid is the ligand for the second heterodimer
receptor (RXR) in PPAR activation. The shift from gene
repression to activation occurs as the RXR goes from the
state of both ligands unbound or bound, respectively.
These two states are illustrated in Figure 5.12. Activation of peroxisome proliferation produces increased
cellular peroxisome content, increased rates of fatty acid
and glucose metabolism, decreased rates of fatty acid
and cholesterol synthesis, increased insulin sensitivity,

and fatty acids flowing from the gut or from hepatic
synthesis is the key to understanding PPAR effects. The
explanation is that free fatty acids are released from adipocytes, whereas lipoproteins are generated in enterocytes and hepatocytes. Lipoproteins contain fatty acids
primarily as triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol
esters. The amounts of free fatty acids that they transport, although small, can contribute to the PPAR effects,
but the magnitude of response is much lower than that
elicited from adipose mobilization. High-fat diets result
in PPAR-α-induced fatty acid catabolism to decrease hypertriglyceridemia and lower the tendency to adiposity.
The δ and γ forms of PPAR have different ligand
responses, and induce different sets of genes involved
in central energy metabolism. Fibrate drugs like gemfibrozil are PPAR-α agonists.98 Insulin sensitizers such
as thiazolidinediones are PPAR-γ agonists.99 Although

Figure 5.12 — PPARα Heterodimer Nuclear Regulation
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor similar to other nuclear
hormone receptors. When both PUFA and 9-cis-retinoic acid ligands enter the nucleus and bind to their respective receptor
sites, the PPARα/RXR heterodimer changes conformation. The shift causes binding of co-activator or co-repressor complexes
to peroxisome proliferation response element genes, changing nearby histone structures. The full response involves activation
of multiple gene expression, leading to the assembly of peroxisomes and, thereby, to multiple metabolic consequences.

a specific fraction of fatty acids contained in a tissue or
body fluid, such as measurements made on plasma total
phospholipid or plasma choline phosphoglycerides,
triglycerides, and cholesterol esters.106
Fatty acids are present in serum or plasma primarily in the form of lipoprotein particles, of which the
LDL species is the most abundant in normal fasting
plasma. The small fraction of free fatty acids in blood is
bound to transport proteins, principally serum albumin.
Profiles report individual concentrations of each fatty
acid instead of measuring only the total of all fatty acids
present, as is common in a serum triglyceride assay.
Patients with high serum triglycerides have higher
levels of some fatty acids in plasma. Conditions, such as
insulin insensitivity, that lead to elevated serum triglycerides do so by stimulating endogenous synthesis and
transport. When glucose or amino acids are used to
build fatty acids in liver or adipose tissue, the principal
product is the 16-carbon-long palmitic acid. Thus, an
elevated palmitic acid in a plasma profile of fatty acids is
evidence of elevated serum triglycerides, and the degree
of palmitate elevation is directly proportional to the
degree of triglyceride elevation.
The majority of fatty acids do not have such linear
relationships with serum triglycerides. Variations of
total triglycerides within the normal range have little
effect on concentrations of the EFA, ALA, GLA, and
EPA, in plasma. Concentrations of these fatty acids
in fasting plasma reflect their composition in adipose
tissue. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition is primarily affected by dietary intake and rates of endogenous
synthesis. Thus levels of fatty acids will depend on the
total effects of endogenous synthesis and recent dietary
intake. Plasma fatty acids are therefore frequently used
in studies of fatty acid status and dietary intake.107-110
Some researchers also report simultaneous plasma and
erythrocyte data from which additional insight is gained

decrease of inflammatory responses, and altered cell
growth and differentiation.97, 100-103
Activation of the PPAR-α/RXR heterodimer increases the rate of fatty acid oxidation in the liver and skeletal
muscle, increases oxidized LDL uptake in cardiac tissue,
and increases reverse cholesterol transport,104 lowering
total circulating LDL.105 Failure of PPAR activation leads
to the rising levels of serum triglyceride and cholesterol
characteristic of metabolic syndrome.70 The more severe
genetic peroxisomal biogenesis defects result in accumulation of VLCFA that affect nervous system structure and
function. To gain a greater understand these relationships, knowledge of phospholipid membrane formation
and maintenance are recommended.

Since the majority of fatty acids in plasma are present in lipoproteins in the esterified form, as glycerol or
cholesterol esters, hypertriglyceridemic patients are also
hyperlipoproteinemic. These patients will also show
elevated plasma fatty acid patterns. Erythrocyte membrane fatty acid profiles do not similarly reflect hypertriglyceridemia. One way to overcome this problem with
plasma data is to use the percentage of total fatty acids
as the basis for calculation. However, this calculation
frequently produces false abnormalities in the majority of non-hypertriglyceridemic patients because of the
influence of the variable levels of the dominant fatty
acids on the total. For example, a falsely low ALA level
(minor component) is produced when oleic and stearic
acids (dominant components) are high. The reverse situation results in a falsely elevated ALA. The same is true
for all of the minor components. Many researchers also
prefer to express fatty acid amounts as a percentage of

Blood Plasma and
Erythrocyte Specimens

Notes:

In addition to plasma and erythrocytes, blood spot
specimens have been successfully used in assessing
fatty acids. The specimen may be useful in nutritional
evaluations and epidemiological studies.116 Applications
include the determination of ratios such as AA/EPA and
Mead/AA (Triene-Tetraene, or T/T).

Interpretation of
Fatty Acid Profiles

It has become common for laboratory profiles of
fatty acids to include more than 40 analytes that may
be measured accurately from a specimen of plasma or
erythrocytes from whole blood. In practice, clinicians
generally do not evaluate each fatty acid individually
but look for patterns. Topics for discussion, thus, are reduced from the 42 analytes and ratios listed in Table 5.1
to several patterns with a few subcategories.

The Clinically Relevant Patterns
Fatty acid analysis provides useful information
about the need for dietary modifications and/or fatty
acid supplementation, as well as the need for certain
vitamins and minerals. The proliferation of studies
reporting favorable neurological effects of the n-3 fatty
acids, especially EPA from fish oil, may induce routine
recommendation of supplemental fish oils to all patients.
However, individual variability of intake, digestion,
absorption and degradation can produce very significant
differences in fatty acid status. Patients with plasma n-3
fatty acid concentrations in the upper range of normal
or higher are unlikely to show significant benefit from
added fish oils. Those with low levels, on the other
hand, may need aggressive supplementation to assure
rapid repletion for positive physiological effects. Thus
supplementation can be targeted to appropriately benefit
each individual patient. Clinical interventions for fatty
acid deficiencies and imbalances often involve modifying
diets to include greater quantities of nuts, seeds, or marine oils, along with necessary micronutrients. Various
useful ratios and indices may be displayed on laboratory
reports to assist interpretation.
Interpretation of laboratory results is simplified by
considering clinical conditions rather than individual
analytes, since most of the information lies in assessing
patterns within families rather than any one member.
Thus, one may concentrate on the abnormalities or

regarding fatty acid metabolism. For example, the higher
levels of LA metabolites in erythrocyte phospholipids
versus plasma lipoproteins was given as evidence of the
importance of assaying the very-long-chain members.111
In addition, a finding of simultaneous decreased plasma
and erythrocyte levels of DHA helped support the conclusion that premature infants may have higher n-3 fatty
acid requirements than term infants.112
Erythrocyte membranes consist of 45% fatty acids
in the form of various phosphatides and glycolipids. The
most common procedure for fatty acid profiling measures concentrations of individual fatty acids in packed
erythrocytes. Fatty acid levels in erythrocytes differ from
plasma profiles in that, although not as representative of
recent dietary intake and adipose composition, they do
provide information about metabolic functions within
the cell. Dietary intake factors are seen on a longer
time scale, since they influence newly formed red cell
populations. Because of the high binding affinities of
desaturation enzymes for LA and ALA and GLA, the
concentrations of these compounds are lower in cell
membranes relative to their levels in plasma lipoproteins
that originate in hepatic lipid biosynthetic and export
pathways.
Drugs that alter fatty acid metabolism will enhance
the differences between plasma and erythrocyte fatty
acids levels. The triglyceride-lowering drug gemfibrozil
causes a profound suppression of erythrocyte unsaturated fatty acids, even in the presence of high concentrations of the same compounds in plasma. The effect
is apparently due to stimulation of the peroxisomal
beta-oxidation system.113 Because of the metabolic effect
of the drug, a patient consuming a diet rich in olive oil
(largely oleic acid) may show low levels of oleic acid in
erythrocyte membranes while maintaining high oleic
acid in plasma. Thus, plasma profiles show the dietary
changes, whereas erythrocyte fatty acids show the metabolic impact of the drug.
Erythrocyte levels of the long-chain metabolic products of elongation and desaturation are representative of
the fatty acid content of other tissues. The DHA composition of brain tissue, for example, is directly correlated
with that in red blood cells in rat and primate studies.114
Thus, although dietary intake is not as closely reflected
and metabolic influences of drugs that alter fatty acid
metabolism must be accounted for, the richer information content induces many clinicians to prefer data from
erythrocytes over those from plasma.115

acids, forming myristoleic and palmitoleic acids. Thus,
elevated levels of these two fatty acids also indicate longterm EFA deficiency.122
Individuals with good fatty acid status have low
levels of the n-9 PUFA, mead acid, in plasma. Mead acid
can be produced in human tissues by repeated desaturation of non-essential fatty acids. Under conditions of
EFA sufficiency, the desaturase enzymes stay primarily
occupied by the much more strongly binding n-3 and
n-6 fatty acid members. As EFA intake falls, mead-acid
production rises, making this n-9 fatty acid a marker for
EFA deficiency.123, 124 Although mead acid cannot participate in eicosanoid formation, it does serve to mimic the
membrane fluidity contributions of PUFAs derived from
essential precursors. Prior to plasma fatty acid profile
abnormalities there is a depletion of PUFA in adipose tissues. When their concentrations reach levels low enough
to free up binding sites on the desaturase enzyme,
oleic acid will be the first non-EFA to take their place,
because of its higher binding affinity relative to the more
abundant palmitic acid. Formation of mead acid is the
result of this phase. Since decreasing AA is a necessary
precursor to mead formation, the ratio of triene (mead
acid) to tetraene (AA), also known as the triene-tetraene
or T/T ratio, provides a sensitive marker of EFA deficiency. Mead acid may be high with normal AA if there
has been a recent intake from AA sources. In long-term
PUFA deficiency, palmitic desaturation to palmitoleic
increases, yielding abnormally high palmitoleic acid. The

restriction. Though research has continued to show that
it is the type of fat in the diet rather than the amount
that is important for weight loss, long-term intake of
low-fat diets is still prevalent.117-121 Such diets can result
in deficiencies of EFAs. Chronic EFA deficiency is indicated by low levels of most n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, as
well as palmitoleic acid, mead acid and triene-tetraene
ratio elevations. Abnormalities in these markers are first
reflected in plasma fatty acid profiles.
EFA deficiency induces compensatory cellular
mechanisms to preserve critical functions. Intercellular
numbers of microsomes and peroxisomes fall to reduce
the flux of fatty acid oxidation pathways. Hepatic fatty
acid synthesis increases and endogenously produced
fatty acids begin to occupy desaturase enzymes of the
ER. Greater levels of mead and palmitoleic, and other
unsaturated members are used as substitutes for dietary
PUFA at the 2-position of membrane phosphatides.
None of the products of de novo endogenous fatty acid
biosynthesis, however, can maintain normal eicosanoid
responses. Clinical signs and symptoms and their fatty
acid association are listed in Table 5.5.
The monounsaturated fatty acids, myristoleic and
palmitoleic, are normally found in very small amounts
in human tissues, because the desaturase enzymes have
weak affinity for their saturated fatty acid precursors,
myristic and palmitic acids. In long-term essential fatty
acid deficiency, the low concentrations of ALA and LA

course of appearance in each case will depend on which
dietary sources are most severely restricted.
The clinical significance of these interactions may
be seen in the reported increase in infant plasma DHA
when the LA/ALA ratio of diet liquid formulas was
lowered from 10.1 to 5.1.125 The higher ratio might be
found in people consuming diets high in corn oil. In
this study, when the ratio was lowered so that LA (18:2)
was no longer so abundant, the ALA (18:3) more easily
passed into the pathway for conversion to DHA. This
phenomenon has important implications for pregnant
women. See the section on “Specific EPA and DHA Deficiency” below for discussion of the effects on childhood
development.
Sustained high intake of EFAs can produce elevated mead acid because of peroxisomal stimulation
and increased rates of fatty acid desaturation. Since the
dominant EFA is normally AA, calculating the ratio of
mead to AA provides a correction for the false mead elevation. The T/T ratio has been widely used as a marker
of EFA deficiency.126 Thus, an observation of elevated
mead should be linked with a check for concurrently
elevated T/T ratio for confirmation of deficiency status.

Of course, when the entire profile of data is available,
it is easy to see the pattern of low levels for ALA, EPA,

Omega-3 Deficiency or Excess
Disorders that are specific to the n-3 class of fatty
acids are detected by inspecting the levels of ALA,
EPA, docosapentaenoic (DPA) and DHA. Deficiency
of n-3 fatty acids is the most common area of clinical
concern regarding fatty acids. Within this class, however, a patient may show signs of overall n-3 fatty acid
deficiency, specific ALA deficiency, or specific EPA and
DHA deficiency. In large epidemiologic studies n-3 fatty
acids were associated with significant reductions in total
mortality, CHD mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and
sudden death, even in those patients with no history of
cardiac disease.130-135

the intermediate DPA in results from profiles of fatty
acids in plasma, erythrocytes, or whole blood. A plasma
fatty acid profile from a typical case is shown in Case
Illustration 5.1. This instance also shows the typical
pro-inflammatory pattern of elevated AA. The clinical
manifestation of this n-3 fatty acid deficiency is one of a
chronic inflammatory state rather than one of essential
fatty acid deficiency that is associated with the same n-3
fatty acid pattern and low AA. Various combinations of
supplemental oils may be used to increase tissue status of
these fatty acids. The compositions of most oils used for
this purpose are shown in Table 5.2. Repletion of a severely depleted patient may require supplemental oil use
over a period of several months. The freshness of food
sources is a critical concern because of the great ease of
oxidative degradation for these polyunsaturated fatty
acids. When dietary supplements are used, they must be
kept from air and light, both of which enhance oxidation
rates. Plasma levels should show increasing n-3 fatty acid
concentrations within 60 days and erythrocyte or wholeblood follow-up testing is best done only after 90 days.

manifestation.12, 128 Fish oil supplementation was also
found to improve liver and pancreas function, shortened
ICU stay and eliminated weight loss in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.38 Whether the origin is
simple dietary restriction or diseases that reduce intestinal fat absorption, patients may be managed by initial
supplementation of dietary oils with high EFA content
and by instruction concerning the appropriate intake
of foods with high EFA content. Both n-3 and n-6 fatty
acids are needed to supply balanced replacement of all
PUFAs. In cases of malabsorption due to loss of pancreatic enzyme or hepatic/biliary bile acid secretion, oral
therapy with appropriate digestive replacement products
may be required.129

Omega-3 Class Deficiencies — Omega-3 intake in
the U. S. is low. Dietary intake of fresh green vegetables
or seafood sources of n-3 fatty acids has been low in
many countries for multiple generations, resulting in
maternally amplified generational effects. The current
U.S. total n-3 fatty acid intake is 1.6 g/d, the majority of
which is ALA, with only 0.1 to 0.2 g/d coming from EPA
and DHA.136, 137
The cell membrane content of n-3 fatty acids
strongly influences fluidity, as well as the availability to
form eicosanoids which influence tissue responses to
stimuli. As n-3 fatty acids enter the bloodstream, their
presence on lipoproteins sends signals to PPAR that initiate increased production of the entire cellular machinery
for fatty acid oxidation. Thus, low intake of n-3 fatty
acids has large effects on fatty acid metabolism.
Recognizing the patient who is deficient in the
entire class of n-3 fatty acids is a simple matter of finding simultaneous low levels for ALA, EPA, DHA, and

Refer to Case Illustration 5.1

Specific ALA Deficiency — ALA is found in plant
sources, but, because of the small amounts of vegetables consumed by most people, it is one of the least
abundant essential fatty acids in the average diet. It is
found in relatively high amounts in flax, hemp, rape
seed (canola), soybean, and walnut oils, and in dark
green leaves. It must be supplied by foods, since human tissues lack the enzymes needed for its formation.
Dietary insufficiencies and imbalances of ALA and its
counterpart, GLA, play a central role in many disease
processes. For example, supplementation of n-3 fatty
acids was found to increase seizure thresholds and lower
inflammatory mediators in patients with epilepsy.138, 139
The wide range of symptoms and disease associations
shown in Table 5.5 is due to the function of this fatty
acid in critical cell processes of membrane integrity and
eicosanoid local hormone production. The hormone
function utilizes EPA, produced from ALA by elongation
and desaturation. The various cofactors required for this
conversion are dependent on zinc status. Inadequate
conversion of ALA into EPA has been used as a marker
of zinc insufficiency in animal studies, and is indicated
by low EPA and DHA in the presence of normal ALA.140

effect of EPA may be involved. In addition, the ability
of EPA to suppress the HPA axis, reversing multidrug
resistance, may allow more effective action of standard
therapy with dexamethasone.164 Furthermore, EPA
inhibits the synthesis of PGE2, decreasing this inducer of
endogenous and synthetic steroids.163 When 1 g/d ethylEPA was given to inpatients who remained depressed
despite adequate standard therapy, 88% had significantly
better outcome than the placebo group on three rating
scales.165
EPA is the parent of the 3-series eicosanoids that
moderate the pro-inflammatory effects of the 2-series
derived from AA. An entire generation of anti-inflammatory drugs, the COX-inhibitors, is based on compounds
that block the cyclooxygenase system. Side effects are
generated by the overriding of normal cellular controls
for regulating the pathways either up or down in specific
tissues to generate appropriate local responses. Optimizing body composition of PUFAs is a way of dealing with
excessive inflammatory signals at the level of precursor
supply. Fatty acid derivatives with immunosuppressive
activities continue to be discovered in natural oils. Oleocanthal from newly pressed extra-virgin olive oil has
ibuprofen-like activity for inhibition of cyclooxygenase
enzymes.166 The endocannibinoids add another powerful
layer of control exerted by balanced tissue composition
of EPA and DHA (see “Fatty Acid Metabolism” above).
Favorable effects of DHA supplementation on cancer
is proposed to be related to changes in levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).167 Intake of EPA is
generally poor, and although it can be produced from
the essential fatty acid ALA, its supply can be limited by
concurrent low ALA intake.136, 137, 168, 169 The conversion
of ALA to EPA requires the action of the ∆6d enzyme,
which is critically dependent on adequate zinc and
inflenced by low status of magnesium, or vitamins B3,
B6, and C.59, 60, 140, 170 Such enzyme impairment would be
suspected if plasma or erythrocyte EPA is low and ALA
is normal or high. High levels of saturated, monounsaturated or trans-fatty acids and defects in desaturase
enzymes also slow the conversion of ALA to EPA (as well
as GLA to DGLA).171 Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)
depresses ∆6 and ∆9d activity without changes in gene
expression.172, 173 Patients under treatment with CLA
may show low conversion of ALA to EPA.
Since both EPA and DHA are critical for vascular
system function, a single value that represents the sum
of both fatty acids has been proposed as a useful marker

An important fatty acid impact on immune responses is the modulation of adhesion molecules that govern
T-cell-B-cell interactions. Levels of soluble vascular adhesion molecule (sVCAM) in dyslipidemic patients were
reduced after 12 weeks of supplementation with 15 mL
of ALA-rich flaxseed oil per day.141 Such results provide a
basis for the prevention of coronary artery disease by use
of PUFA.141 ALA rich flax may provide an alternative to
fish oils to achieve similar long-term cardioprotection.34
The impact of ALA on heart disease is emphasized by
finding that changing the dietary fat fed to hamsters
from butter to flaxseed oil resulted in up to 50% lower
activities of enzymes that regulate the rate of cholesterol
synthesis.142 This finding, along with epidemiologic evidence, highlights the benefits of a diet rich in n-3 fatty
acids, as well as identifying the detrimental effects of a
diet high in animal foods that are low in n-3 fatty acids
and rich in saturated fats, such as dairy products, beef
and pork.143
Correction of low body pools of ALA requires
dietary changes or the use of dietary supplements
containing ALA. When food sources of fatty acids are
examined (Table 5.2), it becomes apparent that the n-6
rich fatty acid oils that are so predominant in modern
diets, such as corn, safflower, and peanut, contribute to
the prevalence of ALA deficiency. Fortunately, there are
other food sources for the longer-chain n-3 fatty acids,
so humans are not completely dependent on ALA intake
for eicosanoid production.

Specific EPA and DHA Deficiency — Insufficiencies of EPA and DHA are likely the most prevalent fatty
acid abnormality affecting the health of individuals in
Western societies. Low levels in plasma or erythrocytes
are indicative of insufficiency. EPA deficiencies have
been associated with neurological conditions, arthritis,
heart disease, cancer, accelerated aging and autoimmune
disorders, presumably as a result of direct or indirect effects of inflammatory responses that may be modulated
by raising EPA levels.134, 144-149 Significant improvements
were noted in ADHD, autism, developmental coordination disorder (DCD), learning disabilities and poor
cognitive abilities when they were supplemented with
fatty acids, primarily EPA-DHA.150-160
Research has also provided evidence of the importance of EPA intake in depression or bipolar disorder.161163
Since severe depression is associated with general
immunoactivation, the general immunosuppressive

occur in glycosphingolipids, particularly those in the
brain. Since this fatty acid is so important in early
development, it is worth noting that the levels in breast
milk are correlated with the mother’s intake of fish oils,
which are rich sources of DHA and DPA.186 Plasma
DHA levels should be checked as early as possible in
pregnancy. In a functional shortage of DHA, the body
synthesizes the most comparable long-chain PUFA in
the n-6 family, osbond acid (22:5n-6). The ratio between
DHA and osbond acid may therefore be a reliable indicator of functional DHA status.187 Babies born to mothers
supplemented with fish oil during pregnancy had higher
DHA, which correlated with lower levels of osbond acid
at birth.188Animal studies have also shown a deficicney
of ALA can reduce DHA and increase osbond acid.189
The finding of low DHA in plasma or erythrocytes
also justifies the use of supplemental DHA for treating
depression.190 Patients with autosomal dominant retinitis
pigmentosa (RP) were found to have much lower RBC
levels of DHA.191 The visual process involves rapid
cycling of DHA within the membrane to accommodate
the binding of DHA to retinoid-binding protein. Studies

for coronary heart disease, the Omega-3 Index.133, 174 In
meta-analysis, when results were expressed as percentage of the total fatty acids, subjects with a sum of
EPA and DHA above 8% had a 90% risk reduction in
sudden cardiac death compared to lower values of the
sum.131, 174, 175 Healthy controls were found to have 20%
lower values for the sum of EPA and DHA in blood cell
membranes than patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In this study, the odds ratio for an ACS
event was 0.31 (p for trend <0.0001) in the highest
EPA+DHA group compared with the group with the
lowest sum.176 In patients with type 2 diabetes, fish oil
supplementation was found to decrease plasma triglycerides, improve n-3 fatty acid status and in some studies
reduces insulin response to oral glucose.177, 178
DHA may protect against emotional disorders as
well as against heart disease. Increased hostility is associated with folate deficiencies and heart disease. Insight
about a possible connection between these associations and fatty acids was provided by a study of blood
concentrations of folate and DHA in hostile and aggressive subjects. The finding of a strong, direct relationship between folate and DHA was explained as being
linked through phosphatidyl choline (PC) formation.
Membrane levels of PC are closely related to the ability of hepatocytes to export DHA, and the methylation
of phosphatidyl ethanolamine to form PC is strongly
dependent on folate adequacy.179, 180 Fish oil sources of
EPA, are shown in Table 5.6.
The growth and development of the central nervous
system are particularly dependent on the presence of an
adequate amount of the very-long-chain, highly unsaturated fatty acids DPA and DHA.112, 181 ADHD and failures
in development of the visual system in essential fatty
acid deficiencies are two examples of this dependency.182
Adult ADHD has been found to be associated with lower
DHA levels,183 but not all studies show positive effects
of supplementation on symptoms once the disorder is
present.184, 185 DHA is an important member of the verylong-chain fatty acids (C22–C26) that characteristically
Notes:

utes to the problem, because trans-fatty acid intake is associated with lower essential fatty acid intake, especially
linoleic acid, and these factors are thought to interfere
with DHA synthesis.190
Improving neonatal DHA status presents a critical challenge, since this fatty acid is required for brain
development,198 and overall maternal essential fatty
acid status tends to decline steadily during pregnancy.
Pregnant women have lower levels of EPA and DHA and
higher levels of palmitate in both plasma and erythrocytes.199 The transfer from red cell membrane to fetus
may be a special mechanism for ensuring fetal supply of
EFA. Under the prevailing dietary conditions, mothers
may be unable to meet the high fetal requirement for
EFA.200 Meanwhile, the mother is more likely to experience postpartum depression related to degradation of
EFA status.201

ALA or EPA Excess — The risk of excessive n-3
fatty acid supplementation has risen along with the
awareness of its health benefits. It is important for clinicians to realize the possibility of excessive use of flax or
fish (or other n-3) oils can produce a condition described as n-3 dominance. It is detected as high absolute
concentrations of the n-3 fatty acid class members with
lowered AA. The laboratory report will show elevated
EPA/ DGLA and depressed AA/EPA ratios. This imbalance can produce a lowering of peak levels of class 2
eicosanoid signals such as leukotriene A2 in response to
distress. Flax oil can produce high plasma ALA without
high EPA if the ∆6d enzyme is inhibited. If fish oil has
been used in excess, ALA may be in the normal range,
whereas EPA and DHA are greatly elevated.
Several concerns have been raised in regards to
n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Though it has not been
systematically studied, there have been anecdotal reports
of patients with excessive supplementation having
difficulty overcoming infection. In placebo-controlled
studies of prescription omega-3 ethyl ester supplements
(4 grams/day) the incidence of flu symptoms, infection
and rashes were 2 to 4 times the rate in control subjects,
who had been given corn oil, as placebo.202, 203 These
results are consistent with a blunting of the immune response due to reduced production of series 2 eicosanoids.
It is suspected that the incidence of effects would be even
greater in the subset of individuals who had higher initial
levels of n-3 fatty acids. Researchers have questioned
the increased risk of bleeding with supplementation,

have found supplementation with DHA and vitamin A
slowed the decline of RP.192, 193 Thus, long-chain PUFAs
modulate metabolic processes and attenuate effects
of environmental exposures, leading to the pathogenesis of vasoproliferative and neurodegenerative retinal
diseases.194
Supplementation of DHA also produced significant increases in all phospholipid fractions of plasma,
RBC, and mucosal specimens in cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients.128 The product of plasma linoleic times DHA
concentrations has been proposed as an alternative to
the sweat chloride test for distinguishing CF patients
from other disorders.195 This product is consistently low
in CF patients in both non-blinded and blinded trials as
shown in Figure 5.14.
The sluggishness of DHA production from ALA, as a
result of the transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to
peroxisomes, explains why the desaturation of both n-3
and n-6 fatty acids in humans is quite slow beyond the
∆5d step that produces EPA.196 Thus, dietary ALA added
during and after pregnancy is ineffective in improving
neonatal DHA.64, 197 Intake of hydrogenated oils contrib-

relevant data from plasma fatty acid laboratory reports
where such a tendency was found in three cases with
different clinical presentations.
Refer to Case Illustrations 5.2–5.4

## Omega-6 (n-6) Class Deficiency or Excess

The great weight of clinical significance of the n-6
fatty acid family arises from a high intake of LA and AA
because of the heavy use of LA-rich oils in food preparation and the practice of fattening cows on LA-rich grains
before slaughter. The beef from such cows tends to be
high in AA and low in ALA and EPA, because the cows
were not allowed to mature by grazing on grasses.218
For patients with an n-6 fatty acid deficiency, the use of
n-3 fatty acid rich oils or foods can exacerbate clinical
outcomes by competing for the desaturase enzymes. The
condition of such patients may be improved by adding
n-6 fatty acid rich oils, such as evening primrose oil,
instead. Alternatively, a low LA can be improved with
the commonly available LA-rich oils or by correcting fat
malabsorption.

though clinical evidence has not supported this.204, 205
There is also a debate over the potential for toxic mercury
accumulation from fish extracts, as well as the risk from
carcinogenic contaminants stored in adipose tissue of
fish,206,207-209 though current evaluations indicate that
their health benefits outweigh the potential harm.
Another effect of the n-3 fatty acid dominant condition is increased risk of oxidative damage and elevated
serum lipid peroxides. Serum lipid peroxides have been
shown to be elevated in patients with heart disease,210
and the association of higher lipid peroxides with rising
triglyceride level has been proposed as a mechanism for
the origin of atherosclerosis.211 In a general outpatient
population, including those heavily supplementing with
fish oils, the levels of serum lipid peroxides tend to rise
in proportion to serum PUFA concentrations.212 Though
it is generally important to increase the intake of antioxidants to confer protection from increased lipid peroxides,213 oxidative stress should be also be monitored by
assessing fatty acid and antioxidant nuttrients.214 Combinations of dietary antioxidants and PUFA treatment has
been proposed in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.14
Depletion of vitamin E may contribute to the EFA deficiencies reported in CF.215
Possible increases in serum lipid peroxides provide reason to exercise caution regarding the possibility
of exceeding antioxidant protection when PUFAs are
supplemented, even though increased hydrogen peroxide production within hepatocytes has been proposed
as a mechanistic explanation of the LDL-lowering effects
of fish oil supplements.216 It should not be assumed
that there are beneficial effects of elevated serum lipid
peroxides, because a specific organelle exhibits beneficial
effects from locally produced oxygen radicals. A report
that in vivo oxidant stress is reduced without changing
markers of inflammation when hypertensive, type-2
diabetic subjects are treated with fish oils may be taken
to indicate that other types of patients will respond
similarly.217 The patients in this study were not evaluated
for PUFAs, and their history would predict an initially
depleted n-3 fatty acid status. It should be noted that, at
some point, increasing intake of n-3 fatty acids is unadvisable. Laboratory results may be used to discern such a
point by demonstrating the n-3 dominant scenario.
When the n-3 fatty acid dominant pattern is found,
the patient should be advised to decrease or discontinue
the use of n-3 fatty acid enriched oils. Plasma levels
of ALA and EPA may be monitored to determine the

Omega-6 Class Deficiency — LA is by far the most
abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in most human
tissues. It is one of the EFAs because it contains a double
bond at the n-6 position, which lies beyond the reach of
the human desaturase enzyme. Low levels indicate dietary insufficiency, which can lead to a variety of symptoms (Table 5.3). Some of these symptoms result from a
lack of linoleic acid in membranes, where it has a role in
structural integrity. Most, however, result from failure to
produce the 1-series and 3-series local hormones known
as prostanoids. The EPA/DGLA ratio is used to assess the
Notes:

In cases of cancer, it is important to evaluate status
before supplementing with GLA because high levels
of n-6 fatty acids may enhance tumor formation and
growth.221 LA has also been shown to inhibit the growth
of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium thought to cause
gastric ulcer.222 Another time of concern for assuring
adequate fatty acid status is pregnancy. Research has
found normal neonatal status of LA to be marginal, if
not insufficient.123 Fetal LA is correlated with maternal
RBC levels.223

Omega-6 Class Excesses — Since its dietary
sources (especially corn oil) are abundant, LA may be
found at above-normal levels in some adults. Excessive
LA can contribute to an overproduction of the pro-inflammatory 2-series local hormones derived from AA.
The AA/EPA ratio is used to evaluate the level of n-6
fatty acid (AA) in relation to the amount of n-3 fatty acid
(EPA). A high ratio has been negatively associated with
several medical conditions.224 Because of the prevalence
of corn and corn oil products in feed for cattle and hogs,
these meats are also high in AA. Diets high in these red
meats are rich in AA, especially in older animals with
higher fat content.225, 226 Very lean beef contains higher
EPA content, so it does not have such a large effect on
increasing the dietary AA/EPA ratio.227 AA is a 20-carbon or eicosanoate fatty acid that serves as substrate for
the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, leading to the production of the 2-series prostanoids and
leukotrienes. Several of these products have potent
pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic activity. Extensive research has identified the neurological effects of
arachidonic acid,228-231 which may be due to arachidonic
acid’s production of PGD2 from cyclooxygenase. In the
brain, the outcome can be alterations in function on
multiple levels. For example, the sleep-disrupting effects
of mental stress are normally related to higher levels of
epinephrine, cortisol, energy expenditure and plasmafree fatty acid concentrations. Research studies have
noted the connection between adrenal activation and
fatty acids. When men were supplemented with 7.2 g/d
fish oil for 3 weeks, their adrenal activation elicited by a
mental stress was dimished, presumably through effects
exerted at the level of the central nervous system.232
When children with ADHD were supplemented with
graded doses of EPA-DHA concentrates so that their
plasma AA:EPA ratios were sustained below 1.0, both
psychiatrist-reported assessment of behavior and global

overall balance of n-3 fatty acids (series 3 eicosanoids)
to n-6 fatty acids (series 1 eicosanoids). Eicosanoids
are a group of oxygenated fatty acids that are produced
by different cell types and regulate many physiological
and pathological functions. DGLA undergoes oxidative
metabolism by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to
produce anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Since LA serves
as the starting point for this pathway low LA intake
almost universally is accompanied by low DGLA. The
1-series prostanoids and leukotrienes are derived from
DGLA, so an insufficiency of this fatty acid impairs a
wide range of cellular functions and tissue responses.
The 1-series compounds act like the 3-series derived
from ALA to moderate the proinflammatory 2-series.
In tumor response, however, they uniquely serve as
promoters of growth, whereas the 3-series are inhibitors.
When testing reveals low levels of DGLA, supplementation with borage or evening primrose oils should be
considered, but, if there is a history of tumor formation,
consideration should be given to ALA sources (black
currant oil) as well.
GLA is the precursor of DGLA.GLA is found in
hemp, borage, black currant and evening primrose oils.
It can be produced in human tissues by the action of
desaturase enzymes on LA. GLA has been found to be
beneficial in immune disorders.35 In controlled trials,
treatment with GLA produced significant improvement
in swelling, tenderness and morning stiffness of rheumatoid arthritis.219,220
Although the n-6 fatty acids, and especially LA, are
overabundant in modern diets, it is important to recognize that the clinical imperative is to identify PUFA imbalance. Except for analysis of a quantitative diet history,
the best way to know whether a patient suffers either
n-6 fatty acid deficit or excess is to perform a laboratory
evaluation of fatty acid status. The data can then guide
interventions that sometimes call for adding, rather than
restricting, dietary LA sources.
Notes:

avoid foods containing hydrogenated oils. Foods that
generally contribute the greatest amounts of trans-fatty
acids include stick margarine, hydrogenated peanut butter, and bakery products such as breads, rolls, cookies,
crackers, pies, and cakes. Product ingredient labels that
list hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oil should be
avoided.
The principal trans-fatty acid in most foods containing hydrogenated oils is elaidic acid (18:1t-n7).There are
two other 18-carbon positional isomers of elaidic acid,
which are called petroselenic and trans-vaccenic acids.
Since the clinical impact of trans-fatty acids is governed
by their total-body status, it is expedient for laboratories
to report the total C18 trans-fatty acid concentration
rather than to attempt to isolate each isomer. After these
three isomers, the next most abundant trans-fatty acid
is palmitelaidic acid (16:1t-n7). The exact food composition of the trans isomers depends on the source of
seed oil involved. However, overall status of trans-fatty
acids is reliably assessed by measuring the predominant
18- and 16-carbon members.

## Micronutrient Deficiencies

## Hydrogenated Oil Toxicity

severity of illness scores improved significantly.233
Decreases in clinical symptoms of depression were also
associated with lower values of the EPA/AA ratio in both
erythrocytes and plasma.234 Thus some of the benefits of
increasing n-3 fatty acid levels may also come from the
concurrent decrease in the AA/EPA ratio. A low AA/EPA
ratio is often seen in n-3 fatty acid dominance and may
give guidance in decreasing fish oil supplementation.
High AA has also been found to promote gallstone
formation by stimulating mucin production in the gall
bladder mucosa.235 Elevated AA is a frequent finding in
profiles of fatty acids in plasma or erythrocytes as exemplified in Case Illustration 5.1. Such a finding should
trigger counseling of the patient regarding dietary AA
reduction and appropriate supplementation to restore
n-3/n-6 fatty acid balance.
When n-6 dietary fatty acids are constantly supplied
in overabundance, the intermediate products of further
desaturation and elongation are not utilized as fast as
they are produced. Under these conditions, the process
of modification can continue through docosadienoic
acid (22:2n6) to the 22-carbon-atom, 4 double-bonded
docosatetraenoic acid (22:4n6). These fatty acids can
then accumulate in adipose tissue.

Trans-fatty acids are prevalent forms of transfatty acids in the diet because of the widespread use of
hydrogenated oils in the food manufacturing process.
These fatty acids contain one double bond, and thus
are included in the unsaturated category. Because of the
geometry of the trans bond, however, they behave like
saturated fats on the one hand, leading to higher cholesterol levels.236 On the other hand, they mimic unsaturated fats in binding to desaturase enzymes and interfering with the normal production of critical products. The
net effect is to raise plasma LDL and lower HDL.The
growing consensus among experts is that foods containing hydrogenated oils are to be avoided. The toxic effects
of trans-fatty acids have been shown to significantly
contribute to the development of atherosclerotic disease,
as well as having negative effects on cancer risk.237-243
The bacteria in the gut of ruminant animals can
produce trans-fatty acids, which is the reason that
beef and milk contain small amounts (1 to 3%) of
elaidic acid. Dietary trans-fatty acid contributed by milk
products is of little concern. A person whose plasma or
erythrocyte levels of trans-fatty acids are elevated should

Patterns of fatty acid abnormalities can indicate
specific vitamin or mineral deficiencies because of
the cofactor requirements of enzymes for fatty acid
metabolism. In many of the fatty acid metabolic
pathways, the fluxes are so large that abnormalities
in fatty acid levels can be highly sensitive markers
of early-stage nutrient insufficiency. Small changes
in functional levels of nutrients can quickly produce
large abnormalities in fatty acids, because the rate of
accumulation is relatively great.

Zinc Deficiency — Since desaturase enzymes
have specific requirements for zinc and the binding constant is not extremely high, their activity falls
dramatically in early stages of zinc deficiency. The result
is an abnormal disparity between the concentrations of
their substrates and products. The ∆6d step required for
conversion of LA to DGLA is usually the highest flux
pathway, so an elevation of the LA/DGLA ratio is a sensitive marker for zinc deficiency. The intermediate fatty
acid in this pathway, GLA corrects most of the biological
effects of zinc deficiency, indicating that the requirement
of the ∆5d enzyme for zinc is a first-order essential function of zinc.58, 244 The sign of elevated LA/DGLA ratio is
illustrated in Case Illustration 5.5, where a concurrent

erythrocyte elemental analysis confirms the low totalbody status of zinc. In cases where LA-rich foods are restricted and extra flax oil is used, the ALA/EPA ratio may
also be elevated because that conversion has become a
dominant pathway requiring zinc.

The bacteria in the gut of ruminants produce large
amounts of propionate, which is absorbed and enters
the metabolism. Consequently, the intake of animal and
dairy products favors higher levels of odd-numbered
fatty acids. Alternatively, it is possible that the bacteria
in the human gut could produce sufficient amounts of
propionate to lead to an elevation in the odd-carbon
fatty acids,252 a situation that would occur only under
conditions of significant gut dysbiosis.

Refer to Case Illustration 5.5

Copper Deficiency — A single report has appeared
noting significant shifts in erythrocyte fatty acid patterns
in copper-deficient rats.245 Levels of stearic and docasadienoic acids were higher, whereas oleic and linoleic
acids were depressed.

Any of the numerous enzymes and organelle systems involved in fatty acid metabolism are susceptible
to gene alterations. Specific patterns of fatty acids may
be used to detect their presence, and, in some cases,
to direct effective interventions to offset the proteomic
alteration.

Hypertriglyceridemia — A plasma fatty acid profile
is an amplification of the standard serum triglyceride
analysis. In both cases, the fatty acids are present in lipoprotein particles. Instead of measuring only the total of
all fatty acids present, the profile test reports the individual concentrations of each fatty acid. An individual with
high serum triglycerides will have higher levels of many
individual fatty acids in plasma. Of course, disorders
associated with elevated serum triglycerides will likewise
be associated with elevated plasma fatty acid concentrations. Patterns of the high concentrations in plasma will
depend on average dietary intake for the past several
weeks, rates of metabolic conversion from precursor to
product fatty acids, and the type of fatty acids in longterm adipocyte storage. Plasma is the preferred specimen
for routine evaluation of the balance of fatty acids being
delivered to the tissues for energy and maintenance.
Interpretation of plasma profile data is less complicated
by metabolic issues and is useful for determining dietary
changes needed to restore balance.
When plasma fatty acids are reported in absolute
concentration units (micromole/liter) the presence of hypertriglyceridemia is generally obvious because multiple
members of all fatty acid classes are elevated. Another
commonly used unit, percent of total fatty acids, does
not show these elevations, because the individual fatty
acids rise in proportion to the total. This situation illustrates the debate over the preferred unit for reporting.
The loss of sensitivity in detecting multiple important
fatty acid patterns in the non-hyperlipidemic population

Vitamin B12 or Biotin Deficiency — The ratio of
vaccenic acid to palmitoleic acid, found to be significantly lower in biotin- deficient rats compared with
controls, has been reported to be a possible important
indicator of biotin deficiency.246 Vaccenic acid also seems
to have large effects on membrane fluidity, possibly due
to the fact that the n-7 double bond does not align with
the much more abundant n-9 positions of the majority of fatty acids present in the membrane. Inhibition
of tumor growth in cell culture has been reported for
vaccenic acid.247
Fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms are
produced primarily by initiating the synthetic pathway
with the 3-carbon compound, propionic acid. Vitamin
B12 is required for the conversion of propionate into
succinate.248 A deficiency of vitamin B12 results in the
accumulation of propionate and a subsequent buildup of
the odd-numbered fatty acids. The association between
vitamin B12 and abnormal fatty acid synthesis provides
a rationale for the neuropathy of cobalamin deficiency.
Odd-chain fatty acids would build up in membrane lipids of nervous tissue, resulting in altered myelin integrity
and demyelination, leading to impaired nervous system
functioning.249
Normal fatty acid biosynthesis also depends on
biotin cofactor availability. The initiation of fatty acid
synthesis through methylmalonyl-CoA is a biotin-dependent step. In biotin deficiency, the rate at which acetylCoA is converted into malonyl-CoA is reduced, allowing
propionate to enter in greater amounts. Elevated levels
of odd-chain fatty acids have been shown to occur in
human plasma phospholipids and in plasma, heart, and
liver in experimental animals with biotin deficiency.250, 251

## Metabolic and Genetic Disorders

is a significant disadvantage to using the percentage
units. Further information on the diagnosis and management of hypertriglyceridemias can be found in standard
medical textbooks.
Relatively small amounts of fish oil can have beneficial effects on plasma triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemic patients.253 Oleic acid is the principal lipid that
makes LDLs resistant to oxidation, and thus a diet rich
in this fatty acid reduces foam cell accumulation rates,
and thereby lowers the chances of atherosclerosis.254
Although the principal concern with dietary fatty acids
is adequate levels of the PUFAs, dietary saturated fat
may be monitored for another index of risk of disease,
especially cardiovascular disease. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging has reported that the combination
of high fruit and vegetable and low saturated fat intakes
is protective against mortality in aging men.255

Multiple Acyl-Coenzyme A Dehydrogenation
Disorders — The medium-chain saturated fatty acids,
capric, lauric, and myristic, accumulate in the fatty acid
catabolic disorders known as medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation (MCAD) disorders.261 A
common scenario is a previously healthy child who
presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, vomiting, and
lethargy triggered by a common illness. In addition to
the abnormalities found in plasma fatty acid profiles,
the C6 to C10 carnitine acyl fatty acid esters accumulate
in plasma. An additional confirmatory test is demonstration of adipic (C6) and suberic (C8) elevations in
urinary organic acid profiles.262
Metabolic beta-oxidation disorders where fatty acids
of all chain lengths are affected are called multiple acyl
dehydrogenase deficiency (MAD). Because of a common
clinical sign, these disorders have also been called glutaric aciduria type II. Late-onset cases may present with
profound muscle weakness and signs of ethylmalonic
and adipic aciduria and low muscle carnitine. Because
massive excretion of multiple organic acids is frequently
found, organic acid profiles of urine may be the most
sensitive way of detecting these disorders.263 Patients
may function normally prior to stressful infections or
other life events. Dietary fat restriction and supplementation with riboflavin and carnitine are effective therapies.264 Some of these enzyme defects are responsive to
riboflavin at levels far above normal intakes.265 Thorough
investigation of biochemical effects in one case showed
that riboflavin therapy produced coordinated and reversible improvements in multiple riboflavin-dependent
enzymes, concurrent with reversal of symptoms.266 With
the widespread availability of biochemical assessment,
the prevalence of late onset MAD is increasing because
of more accurate diagnoses.267, 268

The Metabolic Syndrome — Increase in serum
triglycerides and cholesterol is one of the earliest manifestations of elevated insulin that is characteristic of the
metabolic syndrome.256 Carbon atoms from glucose are
being forced to enter the lipid biosynthetic pathway,
increasing the relative abundance of endogenously
produced fatty acids.257 The fatty acid synthase system
releases palmitic acid that is easily elongated to stearic
and arachidic acids.258 Since fatty acids of shorter chain
length are not produced efficiently, and the very-longchain members are likewise not proportionately increased due to the lower affinity of the elongase enzymes, a characteristic pattern of saturated fatty acids on
plasma profiles tends to develop. On a plasma fatty acid
profile it can be seen as a pattern of high long chain fatty
acids (palmitic, stearic and arachidic) while short chain
(capric, lauric, mystic) and very long chain saturated
fatty acids (behenic, lignoceric, and hexacosanoic) are
low. When viewing the bar graphs in the saturated fats
section from afar, one can see this pattern, similar to a
‘greater than sign’ (see case study 5.6). The same chainlength pattern may be found in the monounsaturated
and odd-chain classes, since they respond to similar endogenous synthesis factors. Because of diabetic-induced
effects on fatty acid transport and metabolism, different
patterns may be found in erythrocyte profiles.259 The
proportion of saturated fatty acids to the total of all fatty
acids in plasma has been found to be positively associated with diabetes incidence.260 The liver can convert
fatty acids into cholesterol. Although any fatty acid can

enter this pathway, palmitic acid is the most stimulatory one known, and high levels lead to increased serum
cholesterol, and thus to increased risk of atherosclerosis,
cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Most other fatty acids
are either cholesterol neutral or have reverse effects, as
in the case of EPA. Palm kernel and coconut oils are rich
sources of palmitic acid. Palmitic acid synthesis is stimulated by hyperinsulinemia and by diets high in simple
carbohydrates.

Fatty Acid Ratios and Indices

Erucic acid is apparently one of the components
responsible for the favorable response of individuals
with adrenal leukodystrophy to preparations containing canola and mustard seed oils.273 Other studies using
Lorenzo’s oil containing glycerol trierucate revealed no
appreciable changes in brain-lipid content.271 In Zellweger syndrome, in which peroxisomes are absent, erucic
and adrenic (docosatetraenoic) acids accumulate. It is
speculated that either the anabolic enzymes are inhibited
from producing sphingolipids or the catabolic enzymes
are stimulated to faster clearance of the offending
products.274
Nervonic acid contains the longest chain of carbon
atoms of all monoenoic fatty acids present at appreciable
levels in plasma and erythrocytes. The unique structure
of nervonic acid confers special properties to nerve
membranes, where it is found in highest concentrations.
The myelin sheath is especially rich in nervonic acid.
Nervonic acid accumulation in red blood cells yields
information on cerebrum maturation in premature
infants.275
Oleic acid constitutes 15% of the fatty acids in
erythrocyte membranes. In tumor cells, stearic-acid falls
as oleic-acid rises, causing a profound shift in the ratio
of stearic to oleic acids.276 The stearic-oleic ratio is used
as a monitor of the effectiveness of cancer therapy in
certain types of cancer.277 The shift to higher unsaturation of membrane fatty acids produces increased fluidity
of the tumor cell membrane, resulting in more rapid
movement of nutrients and waste products and allowing
for faster metabolic rate.
Modulation of endogenous desaturation rates is
involved in controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis.278 Increased ∆9d activity in tumor cells shifts the
relative abundance of saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids, causing lowered saturated and elevated monounsaturated members that is most highly significant when
expressed as the stearic/oleic ratio.278-280 More specifically, the ratio of stearic to oleic acid in red-cell membranes
has been found to be a strong indicator of the presence
of malignant tissue, as it reflects the lowered ratio found
in malignant tissue-cell membranes.281, 282 Stearic/oleic
values below 1.1 are associated with the presence of
malignancy. The ratio was found to respond to hormonal
therapy for prostatic cancer, and, in studies following
surgical cures, individuals who maintained this ratio
above 1.1 had no tumor recurrences. The stearic-oleic
ratio, sometimes referred to as a saturation index, is
also lowered in carcinoma of the gallbladder.283 Colonic
adenocarcinoma cells display increased stearic acid
synthesis with elevated stearic-oleic ratios.284 The ratio is
not a general cancer marker, since some cancers display
opposite effects. Movement of a low ratio to higher levels provides an indicator for efficacy of a cancer therapy.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) — Lack of peroxisomal activity resulting in the accumulation of verylong-chain fatty acids is associated with degenerative
diseases of the central nervous system such as adrenal
leukodystrophy. Specifically, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder of peroxisomal
fatty acid oxidation in which the erythrocyte hexacosanoic acid level becomes greatly elevated. Treatment with
a mixture of olive and canola oil containing predominantly glycerol esters of oleate and erucate were reported
to have beneficial effects.269 Subsequent studies have
failed to substantiate the benefit on disease outcomes270,
except in asymptomatic boys.272
There are a large number of known genetic disorders involving the accumulation of sphingolipids, which
is usually due to the lack of enzymes needed to maintain
the turnover of membrane components. Behenic, lignoceric, and hexacosanoic acids, as well as the unsaturated
members of the C22 to C24 classes, especially nervonic,
are found elevated in such cases. A laboratory report
showing specific elevation of VLCFA is shown in Case
Illustration 5.7.

The Polyunsaturated to Saturated
Fatty Acid Ratio (P/S)
Originating primarily as a measure of the quality
of dietary fats, the PUFA to saturated fatty acid ratio is
sometimes used also as a general measure of physiological fatty acid balance. This ratio increases markedly during exercise, as the saturated fatty acids are preferentially
utilized as energy sources, causing plasma levels to fall
relative to the unsaturated fatty acids.285 The availability of individual fatty acid data allows the inclusion
of trans-fatty acids in the saturated group, since their

physiological behavior is the same. This has not normally been done in the food industry to date, resulting
in the posting of misleadingly favorable ratios on food
labels. The overall effect of higher levels of the polyenoic
fatty acids is the suppression of hepatic lipogenesis.286

lipid-lowering drugs, depending on the class of hyperlipidemia found by studies of lipoprotein subclasses and
cholesterol levels.
When total fatty acids are low, chronic stimulation
of peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids may be present.
A number of structurally diverse chemicals have been
found to cause proliferation of peroxisomes in liver and
other tissues.287 Paradoxically, high-fat diets also cause
such proliferation. The increased oxidative activity leads
to higher levels of hydrogen peroxide and development
of liver tumors in laboratory animals.288 In humans, the
related disorder, hypobetalipoproteinemia, is associated
with increased risk of a variety of cancers and pulmonary and gastrointestinal diseases.289

Total Fatty Acid Concentration (Calculated)

The correlation of serum trigyceride levels with
plasma saturated fatty acid concentration has been
discussed. A tighter correlation may be found by
calculating the sum of measured concentrations in a
comprehensive fatty acid profile. Widely used treatments
for elevated triglycerides involve dietary restriction of
fats, the use of pharmacological doses of niacin, and

of fish oil and 600 mg of flax oil per day. All four members of
n-3 fatty acids are found in the fifth quintile.
The presence of fifth quintile LA with lower second quintile
AA shows a significant suppression of n-6 desaturation. The
AA/EPA ratio is in the first quintile, but not yet below the
2.5% cutoff for abnormality. However, continuing this level
of n-3 oil supplementation can further suppress AA formation to generate a very low AA/EPA ratio.
The concurrent finding of fifth quintile mead acid and very
elevated T/T ratio indicates an additional stimulation of peroxisome oxidation by EPA. There are no clear adverse clinical
consequences at this stage, but the data provides a warning
of the potential for crossing into clinically suppressed AA
status and various consequences of sustained high peroxisome status, so supplementation of n-3 enriched oils should
be moderated. v

long history of cardiovascular disease. He had undergone
a quadruple cardiac bypass surgery and mitral valve

4th quintile, with 2nd quintile DGLA, the calculated
LA/DGLA ratio is somewhat elevated, a sign of functional
zinc insufficiency impairment of desaturase enzyme
activity. In this case the pattern is strengthened by
examining for desaturase activity failure in the n-3 family.
There we find elevated ALA with lower 2nd quintile EPA,
confirming the effect. Confirmatory evidence is found in
the concurrently run RBC element profile where the zinc

This plasma fatty acid profile reveals the effects of
chronic insulin stimulation on endogenous fatty acid
synthesis. The report was generated for a 48-year-old
female with high waist to hip ratio, elevated triglycerides
and cholesterol, and high fasting insulin with normal
glucose. The fatty acid synthase enzyme complex
retains the growing chain until the length reaches 16
carbon atoms (palmitic acid). Elongase enzymes add
two-carbon units efficiently to produce the 18- (stearic)
and 20-carbon (arachidic) products. By connecting the
quintile chart points, a pattern is seen that has the shape
of a greater than sign (>). The relative abundances of
saturated fatty acids are reflected in their desaturase
products, so the same pattern is found in the family of
monounsaturated fatty acids. Further confirmation of
metabolic syndrome effects on fatty acid metabolism
may be found in elevated levels of the LA/DGLA ratio.
Elevated insulin suppresses desaturase enzyme activity,
slowing the rate of LA conversion to DGLA. v
