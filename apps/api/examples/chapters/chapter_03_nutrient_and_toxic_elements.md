## General Concepts

deficiencies vary with each element, but may be categorized as those which decrease supply and those that
increase demand. Figure 3.1 illustrates how the overall
contributions of various factors combine to dictate the
progression toward iron deficiency or repletion. Supply
is lowered by depleted soil,28 toxic element interference,29 poor food choices25 and compromised digestion,
including iatrogenic-induced gastric acid reduction.30,
Most of these factors affecting demand also generally
impact other essential elements.
The term “mineral” that has been used in many
discussions of the nutritionally essential elements
actually refers to natural compounds formed through
geological processes. Since the nutritionally essential
chemical elements covered in this chapter occur in the
human body in forms quite distinct from those found in
the crust of the earth, the more general term “element”
will be used. The same may be said of the toxic
elements. Thus, the terminology “nutrient and toxic
elements” in clinical assessments of blood, urine, hair

Across all demographic strata in industrialized
nations, element deficiencies are recognized as being
involved in the pathogenesis of many health conditions,
including heart disease, hypertension3 and cancer.412
Certain populations demonstrate a relatively high
incidence of elemental deficiencies, including pregnant
women,13-15 children and adolescents,16,17-19 the elderly,20
and those who are immunocompromised.21-23 However,
in the United States the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (currently designated DRI*) is not met by
diet alone in most population groups for magnesium,
calcium and potassium.24, 25 Element deficiencies during the perinatal period can contribute to behavioral,
immunological and biochemical abnormalities that can
last in adulthood.26 Essential element deficiencies during embryonic development can cause mental retardation27 and may contribute to the severity of genetic
abnormalities.26 The causes of such widespread element

* While the term dietary reference intake (DRI) has been adopted for discussions of intake levels, the older term, recommended dietary
allowance (RDA), will be used instead because of its continued widespread use by clinicians and laypeople. The term tolerable upper limit
(UL) is used when discussing current recommended upper intake levels.

Iron Deficiency
Figure 3.1 — Factors Contributing to Iron Deficiency

Various combinations of factors can add up to elemental deficiency, as illustrated here for iron. To move a patient from
states of deficiency to repletion, multiple actions may be required, the most common of which is oral supplementation of
absorbable forms of iron or other elements as indicated by laboratory evaluations. The ultimate goal is to guide the patient to
improved habits of diet and lifestyle that improve supply while managing factors that increase demand.

or other body fluids or tissues corresponds to most
clinical laboratory reporting conventions.
As for all of the discussions of nutrient use in
patient treatment in this book, the object is to present practicing clinicians with practical information
for assisting the nutrient-deficient patient’s return to
optimal function. This objective is to be distinguished
from those of government and scientific panels that
may attempt to derive safe and effective levels of intake
to prevent frank deficiency or possible toxicity. Disagreement exists among experts worldwide as to daily
element requirements versus tolerable upper limits for
the general population.32 For instance, the current RDA
for total magnesium intake in males is 420 mg/d. This
level is higher than the published tolerable upper limit
of 350 mg/d of supplemental magnesium.33 Accurate
laboratory testing to assess body status pre- and post-

supplementation can ensure repletion by demonstration
of normal test results, along with clinical observations to
monitor patient improvement.
Clinical laboratory testing likewise clarifies questions of excessive use of nutrient elements and significant exposure for toxic elements, whereas functional
markers can demonstrate metabolic poisoning. In
routine clinical practice it is generally agreed that testing
should identify chronic low level effects as well as diagnose the frankly toxic individual. Various government
authorities have set levels that are agreed to raise alarm
about imminent severe toxic effects of organ failure or
life-threatening irreversible damage. However, chronic
exposure to low levels of toxic elements can lead to disparate clinical disorders with manifestations vastly different from the symptoms of acute toxicity.34 Thus, the
clinical laboratory may establish certain toxic element

limits for potential concern plus higher limits for alarm.
Laboratory testing can reveal element deficiencies and toxicities by direct measurement of element
concentrations in body fluids or tissues, or by measuring biochemical markers that give evidence of the
element’s metabolic activity, be it toxic or essential. For

example, urinary iodine can provide evidence of intake,
whereas serum free T3, free T4 and thyroid-stimulating
hormone are iodine functional biomarkers. The various
options for essential element assessment and dosages for
repletion are summarized in Table 3.1 and are further
elaborated under each element section below. Likewise,

discussions of assessment methods and protective
measures for each toxic element are summarized in
Table 3.2.
Before entering into discussions of individual elements, tables of information are presented to convey
the spectrum of elemental deficiency clinical effects and
relationships to mortality. Table 3.3 summarizes signs
and symptoms of deficiency and toxicity for the nutritionally essential elements. Small tables containing parts
of this information are placed at the beginning of each
element discussion. Table 3.4 lists specific studies that
have shown relationships of elemental deficiencies to
top causes of death in the United States.
Practitioners frequently raise questions regarding
the best specimen or functional biomarker for screening
versus confirmatory evidence of deficiency or toxicity
and the clinical significance of abnormalities detected.
The first section of this chapter focuses on the general
concepts of element metabolism. Next, general considerations of specimen and test choice are discussed,
followed by detailed discussions of each nutrient and
toxic element, with emphasis on effective approaches to
assessment of individual patient status.

The elements are grouped by their designations
as essential, uncertain, toxic or potentially toxic and,
within those categories, by their relative concentrations
in the human body (macroelement or trace element). An
introduction to the toxic element section includes a discussion on mechanisms of toxicity. For most elements,
the discussion is divided into sections on biochemical
and nutritional background, clinical indications, and
the consequences of deficiency or toxicity. For some
elements, the routes of absorption and excretion and homeostatic mechanisms regulating total-body status and
transport are discussed. Assessment of element status

Figure 3.2 — Effects of Elemental

Deficiency or Excess

Negative consequences usually are associated with
deficiency or excess of any element, as illustrated by
the U-shape of the effects curve. For example, copper
deficiency may be associated with increased oxidative
stress due to low activity of the cuproenzyme superoxide
dismutase. On the other hand, excess free copper ions
produce oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction, which
generates hydroxyl radicals. Thus, elements like copper
have a fairly narrow concentration range for optimum
function. Laboratory evaluations may be needed to
demonstrate that neither extreme is a threat. For further
discussion of dose response effects, refer to the Chapter 8
section, “Dose-Response Curve and the Hormesis Model.”

Whole-body content of the major, or macro, elements such as calcium and magnesium are in gram
amounts, whereas trace elements such as copper and
manganese are in milligram amounts. To the analytical
chemist, however, the term “trace element” indicates
that, because the element cannot be measured with high
accuracy, it must be designated as “less than detection limit” in the specimen submitted for analysis. As
instrumental sensitivities improve, trace element may
then imply one that was previously undetectable. Those
that are difficult to detect with more sensitive methods
may be called “ultratrace elements.” The elements that
fall into such analytical categories vary from one tissue
to the next, but the terminology is useful for general
discrimination of relative amounts.
Thirteen trace elements are currently known to be
nutritionally essential for human health. Usually present
at concentrations of micrograms per gram of tissue or
less (< 1 ppm), these elements are iron, copper, zinc, iodine, selenium, boron, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum,
manganese, vanadium, silicon and nickel.5 Macrominerals phosphorus, magnesium and calcium are present in
total-body content of tens or hundreds of grams. The
macrominerals sodium, potassium and chloride are classified as electrolytes because of their roles in maintaining
ionic equlibria in physiological systems.
Plants and animals have evolved highly efficient
mechanisms for extracting nutritionally important elements that are often present in soil and food in minute
amounts. A defining characteristic of a trace element is
that a very small amount is necessary for proper function of the whole organism. Only a few milligrams of
an element such as zinc in a large organ such as liver
or muscle can make the difference between normal and
abnormal function. When a zinc ion is not available to
function as an enzyme cofactor, or a toxic element such
as cadmium displaces the available zinc, the result is
amplified because of the interruption in flow of metabolic products. When those products are cell regulators
that modulate yet other systems, the end effect can be a

with discussions of interventions by dietary modification, the use of nutritional supplements, or toxic element removal strategies.

tissue-wide slowdown generated by loss of only a tiny
amount of active zinc.
The major roles of essential elements in biological
systems are (1) electron acceptors in oxidative/reductive
homeodynamics; (2) enzyme cofactors; (3) crystalline
structures, especially in bone; and (4) ionic migrations
necessary for nerve signal transmission or cell regulatory responses. Trace elements such as iron, copper
or molybdenum serve biological oxidation-reduction
functions due to their ability to easily accept and release
electrons (i.e., change valence states). In oxidation steps,
electrons are lost, and in reduction steps, electrons are
gained. Several trace elements, including zinc and selenium, serve to stabilize enzyme structures or position
substrates in enzyme-active sites. Non-metal elements
(selenium, iodine) and metalloids (silicon, boron) may
form covalent bonds with carbon and oxygen, and they
may be found as part of a structural protein or enzyme

Nutrient and
Toxicant Interactions

Not only are element deficiencies frequently
encountered, they also tend to occur in multiples (see
Case Illustration 3.1). Multiple element deficiencies may
occur when the diet is poor or digestion and absorption
are impaired. In an element-deficient state, there may be
an up-regulation of transport proteins in the gastrointestinal tract, which may allow for greater absorption of
toxic elements.98 Thus, essential element deficiency can
increase vulnerability to toxic element exposure.
The deficiency or excess of one element can affect
the utilization of other elements. Multiple elements may
interact with a single type of transport protein, although
one may bind more strongly than another. For instance,
the excessive intake of zinc antagonizes intestinal
copper absorption to the point that a copper deficiency
can result despite adequate copper intake.99 Copper
deficiency exacerbates iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency, in turn, exacerbates the toxic effects of lead and
cadmium and increases absorption of manganese.98, 100
Beneficial interactions also exist. For example, selenium
mitigates the toxic effects of mercury29 and arsenic,101
whereas zinc minimizes the effects of cadmium toxicity
(Table 3.2).102 Vitamin status also affects elemental status
as in the promotion of intestinal absorption of iron by
vitamin C and the stimulation of intestinal calcium
transport by vitamin D.
Clinical symptomatology arising from chronic
low-grade essential element deficiency and toxic element burden can be difficult to identify, as numerous
organ systems can be involved. Genetic predisposition,
nutritional insufficiencies and exposures to toxicants
of other types are factors that can also impact element
imbalances and contribute to clinical symptomatology.

(i.e., selenium as selenocysteine in enzymes, and silicon
in connective tissue). Magnesium and calcium are found
in three states: bound to proteins, bound in the crystalline matrix of bone, and as free ions in all body fluids.
In their free ionic forms, calcium and magnesium are
regulators or modifiers of enzyme activity.
Essential elements tend to display bell-shaped doseresponse curves. The curve represents overall functional
response to varying intakes of a given element. Low
intake results in a deficiency state, whereas high intake
results in toxicity symptoms. In the case of copper, both
deficiency and toxicity can cause increased oxidative
stress via different mechanisms (Figure 3.2). The optimal
amount of trace element intake is in the middle of the
curve, where function is maximized and toxicity is minimized. Any element can become harmful if intake exceeds the body’s ability to utilize, store or eliminate the
element. Nutrient elements are no exception to this rule.
For some elements, the difference between deficiency or
toxicity spans a 100-fold range of consumption.95 For
others, the range is only 10-fold. The essential element
selenium can produce signs of toxicity from daily intakes
of only 5 mg. This exceeds the US RDA by only a factor
of 25.96 Of course, some elements are characteristically
toxic and cause harm even in very small exposures.
Lead, cadmium and mercury rank highest on this list.
Modern life in an industrialized society has resulted in
increased exposures due to the enormous amounts of
toxic metals released into the environment.
Daily fluctuations of essential element intake have
small impacts on blood serum concentrations that
become trends over several days. Trends in serum and
transport or storage protein element content become
larger tissue-level trends over longer time intervals.
Human elemental status is complicated by complex
homeostatic mechanisms (see the section “Iron” below)
that sequester elements in specific tissues or change
their binding to transport proteins with transient factors
such as inflammation. Feedback effects that alter rates of
intestinal absorption serve as key homeostatic mechanisms. For example, copper absorption can vary from
12 to 70% of a standard ingested dose.97 Toxic element
assessment, likewise, presents challenges. Because toxic
elements are bound to tissue proteins, their levels in
body fluids may not reflect total-body burden. Thus,
multiple tests, using different specimen types, are recommended for the most accurate and reliable represention
of a person’s elemental body status.

Notes:

An assessment of total toxicant stress on an individual’s
metabolism is sometimes referred to as the “toxic load.”
The toxic load takes into consideration an individual’s
genetic makeup, including polymorphisms that may
compromise detoxification capacity, nutrient availability
and exogenous toxin exposure, including metals, chemicals and other xenobiotics.

calcium. Digestive factors that may dramatically decrease
element absorption include inadequate (or diluted)
stomach acid, low alkaline pancreatic output, or low
pancreatic digestive enzymes.30, 103, 104

Intervention Options

Dietary supplements of elements (as elemental salts)
are available in many forms. Because simple forms such
as magnesium oxide or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt)
are very poorly absorbed, complexed or chelated forms
are usually recommended.105 The most common of these
are the lactate, gluconate, citrate, picolinate or amino
acid (especially aspartate) salts, sometimes called chelates. Chelated element production methods can be important considerations when choosing vendors of dietary
supplements. Simply mixing an elemental oxide with an
amino acid does little good to promote absorption of the
element. The formation of organic ligands with metal
ions requires careful adjustment of pH with introduction
of the new complexing agent at the proper time, similar
to that described above for the normal digestive process.
Oral supplementation ranges for properly complexed
forms of elements are shown in Table 3.1.

When elements contained in food pass through the
normal digestive process, they undergo several changes
in chemical bonding as various metal complexes are
formed. The low pH of normal postprandial stomach
fluid serves to weaken the native protein-bound elements in food and cause increased free ionic concentrations with chloride counter ions in the gastric fluid.
Thus enzyme-bound manganese in whole grains tends
to become soluble manganese chloride during gastric
digestion. The pH of chyme leaving the stomach is
raised by the action of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid
(in response to secretin hormone action). The chloride
salts can then form new complexes with negatively
charged amino acids (aspartic and glutamic acids) and
organic acids. Thus, the mixture that passes down the
small intestine contains a variety of mineral salts such
as calcium aspartate, magnesium glycinate, vanadium
citrate, and myriad other complexed forms, depending
on the characteristics of each element. Before they are
transported across the intestinal mucosa, most elements
undergo at least an additional transition in complexed
form. The calcium in milk is thought to undergo multiple transitions, one of the most available forms for
assimilation being calcium orotate. Abundant orotate in
cow’s milk contributes to the high availability of milk

Element Status Assessment
Choosing the Best Specimen
for Element Testing
There is no single best specimen for simultaneous,
optimal status assessment of essential elements and
toxic heavy metals. For each element, there are merits
and limitations of the specimens commonly tested, such
as serum or plasma, urine, hair and whole blood or its
cellular constituents. Sections devoted to each element
describe their unique characteristics and the evidence
for clinically useful testing. According to the weight of
published evidence, serum is the specimen most frequently used, although it is used primarily to determine
excessively high levels. The value of urine for questions
of essential element adequacy is very limited. The best
specimen for detecting essential element deficiency depends on the element. Comparing results from multiple
types of specimens can provide a more complete picture
of elemental status.106 Enhanced sensitivity may be

Hair

Hair specimens can be useful in routine screening for toxic metal exposure. A specimen composed of
1.5 inches of hair closest to the scalp gives information
about the past 3 months of exposure. Keratin, which is
rich in sulfur-containing cysteine residues, is the major
component of hair. In the active phase of hair growth,
the follicular cells have a high rate of metabolic activity. When elements circulating in blood reach the hair
follicle, they bind with high affinity to keratin, becoming trapped in the extruded shaft of hair. Due to its high
sulfhydryl group content and, consequently, its great
affinity for multivalent metals, hair concentrates toxic
metals at least 10-fold above concentrations found in
blood.107 For assessing a history of toxic metal exposure,
hair serves the purpose of being a chronological “recorder” that has been used in forensic studies to show the
time of exposure. For these reasons, when exogenous
metal contamination is excluded, hair is described in
toxicology textbooks as a very useful specimen for toxic
metal testing.108 With attention to exogenous contamination, the analysis of hair for status assessment of some
nutrient elements can also be useful.
Because of the ease of sampling and the apparent rich information content in a profile of 25 or more
elements, hair element testing has become a favorite
tool among some practitioners. Unfortunately, some

obtained by measuring 24 hour excretion following oral
or IV challenge with nutrient elements or with chelating
agents that mobilize toxic elements.

Treatment for low element status mainly consists of aggressive dosing of easily assimilated forms of the
deficient elements, as well as encouraging greater intake of food sources and correction of digestion or absorbtion
problems. Elements chelated to Krebs cycle intermediates (e.g., magnesium citrate) may be the best absorbed
forms. Signs of inadequate stomach acid production include rapid satiation or complaints of gas and bloating
that prevent further eating. Reflux may also be a sign of inadequate stomach acid production. The pH capsule
test is sometimes used to assess gastric acid secretion. Acid-generating agents include betaine hydrochloride
and bitter herbs.
Since low stomach acid is frequently associated with poor pancreaticobiliary output, pancreatic enzymes that
assist protein digestion may also be needed. Bile replacement or dietary oils that stimulate bile flow can further
assist with protein digestion by breaking down dietary fat that adheres to food particles. Supportive interventions
such as essential elements, amino acids, fiber and antioxidants are discussed below.
A lifestyle change can be of significant benefit in cases of chronic elemental malabsorption. The simple
practice of thoughtfully chewing food and pausing for several minutes in a relaxed state of mind after eating major
meals can improve stomach retention through stimulation of parasympathetic nervous system activity. Further,
these actions increase needed acidification of chyme to release bound elements and start the protein digestion
process that produces the digestive chelates needed for presentation to intestinal mucosal cells. Convincing
patients who are habituated to the busy Western lifestyle to take such pauses of time may be challenging.

## Blood

When selecting a single multi-element profile for
nutrient status testing, whole blood or red blood cell
(RBC) specimens are valuable. Whole blood is commonly used for baseline, non-challenged toxic element
assessment. A flowchart based on initial decisions regarding the need for toxic metal assessment is presented
in Figure 3.3. Since each essential element functions
synergistically with other elements and nutrients, multielement profiles coupled with functional biomarkers can
provide the best insight into abnormalities in mobilization, utilization and excretion.
It may be difficult to demonstrate chronic exposure to toxic metals in samples of hair, blood and urine
despite clinically significant body burdens because they
tend to accumulate in specific tissues (especially bone,
liver and kidneys). If the main routes of elimination are
compromised, testing of body fluids may show falsely
normal values. In these situations, testing that shows
a metabolic impact of the toxic element is helpful. See
Chapter 8, Toxicants and Detoxification, for discussion
of how urinary porphyrin profiling may be used for
this purpose.

Screen for Nutrient
and Toxic Elements

laboratories have greatly overstated the diagnostic potential of hair element analysis. The calculation of long
lists of meaningless ratios and the inclusion of detailed,
misleading metabolic interpretations have led to investigations that paint a poor picture of the testing. In 2001,
an analysis of a split hair sample sent to six commercial
laboratories was reported.109 Some of the results showed
poor correlation between laboratories, and the interpretive comments varied widely, leading the authors to
recommend private restraint and regulatory restrictions
on all laboratories offering elemental testing of hair.
Although some restrictions may become necessary to
avoid misguided interventions, the conclusions of such
reports should be evaluated in context of the approximately 3,000 reported studies of hair elemental analysis
that have demonstrated its strong potential as a useful
clinical tool. Many of these reports have been the subject
of independent reviews.110-113

Status Testing

Choosing specimens for evaluation of elemental status
depends on the clinical focus of concern. If no significant
toxic element exposure is suspected, then one or more
of the specimens for essential elements may be used.
Element-specific focus can alter which of these specimens
is best and functional markers may be employed. Using
porphyrin profiling to initiate investigation of toxic
elements provides evidence of significant toxic effects.
Chelation challenge urinary excretion testing or toxic
element panels on hair or whole blood may be ordered to
further assess toxic element exposures.

➧ Hair

Urine

Urine presents a different aspect of element balance.
Urine can vary with recent dietary intake. Thus, for
individuals whose day-to-day dietary intake is relatively
constant, normal levels of urinary zinc and chromium
can reflect nutritional adequacy for these elements, since
urine is the main route of excretion for many elements
when intake is plentiful. On the other hand, for individuals with large daily variations in diet, urinary levels are
more difficult to interpret. For example, consumption of
oysters or shellfish might show high urinary measurement of zinc, but may not reflect a patient’s overall low
status of zinc. Twenty-four-hour urine specimens are
commonly used in research, although accurate results
rely on the patient’s ability to reliably collect their urine
for 24 hours and measure the volume accurately. Over
90% of most chelating agents are cleared by the kidneys
in a few hours. Further urine collection can be counterproductive due to dilution of the toxic element concentrations passed in the first few hours. Thus, a six- to
eight-hour urine specimen collection is not only more

Each DMSA molecule contains two electron-rich sulfur
atoms. In the form shown, the sulfur atoms of the two
DMSA molecules form four ligands with the central
divalent mercury atom. The combination of its chelating
ability and high renal clearance make DMSA an appropriate
treatment for removal of a number of toxic metals.

levels over ranges set on non-chelated individuals.115
If clinical symptomatology is not compelling, further
testing for functional evidence of a toxic burden, such as
a urinary porphyrin profile, may be considered prior to
initiating aggressive treatment. Combination of chelating
agents such as DMSA and EDTA treatments may effectively reduce toxic metal body burdens. For example,
treatment with EDTA followed by a dose of DMSA may
increase lead excretion.116 Even as clinicians chelate
toxic elements, rigorous testing further confirms the difficulty in predicting the behavior of metals in the body
(see Case Illustration 3.2). The field of chelation and
metal detoxification has been covered in reviews,2 and
further information can be found at the American Board
of Clinical Metal Toxicology and the American College
for Advancement in Medicine.
DMSA: Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
is an FDA-approved chelating agent that mobilizes heavy
metals, such as lead and mercury, from human tissues.117-122 DMSA transiently diffuses into and effectively
competes with the tissue-binding sites to release toxic
metals that are normally sequestered in bone, nerve,
liver, etc. Effectiveness in mobilization of cadmium, lead

Chelation challenge tests offer a more sensitive
way to assess total-body burden of toxic metals or for
assessing a patient whose toxic metal exposure occurred
at an unknown point in time. Oral or intravenous (IV)
administration of a chemical that has strong affinity for
toxic elements causes a small quantity to redistribute
into the blood as a stable complex and be eliminated in
the urine, where it can be measured. Low-molecularweight chelating agents specifically bind and mobilize
certain toxic metals from tissues into circulation. Typically, a challenge consisting of an oral or IV dose of the
chelating agent is administered. Urine is collected for the
next 6 to 8 or 24 hours and analyzed for toxic metals.
The more convenient 6- to 8-hour collection is effective because a large percentage of the chelating agents
are cleared into the urine in the first few hours after
administration. Since essential minerals are lost from the
body during the therapy, it is desirable to determine the
extent of losses of both toxic and essential elements by
performing analysis at baseline (pre-challenge) and with
chelation (post-challenge).
An elevation in one or more toxic metals in the
post-challenge urine, when compared with baseline,
may confirm the diagnosis of elevated toxic metal body
burden with potential toxic consequences. The baseline
may be the laboratory reference limit for unchallenged
urine or the patients own unchallenged element concentration. Rules such as a four-fold increase over unchallenged levels have been proposed for judging clinically
significant effects from a single oral chelator challenge.114
Due to the ubiquitous presence of toxic metals in the
environment, chelation is expected to yield toxic metal

There are many chelation challenge procedures employed by clinicians to assess toxic metal body burden.
Since chelation agents will bind and remove essential elements in addition to the toxic elements, some clinicians
discontinue essential element intake prior to urinary collection, although if the individual is deficient in elements, discontinuation may be contraindicated. However, if chelation therapy is initiated beyond the challenge
test, regular supplementation and laboratory assessment of essential elements is important. In addition to essential element supplementation, other supportive nutrients such as antioxidants, vitamins and fiber are commonly
used. Chelation therapy training is available through a variety of organizations, including the American Academy
of Environmental Medicine and the American College for Advancement of Medicine. Pediatric chelation protocols are available through physician-directed organizations such as Defeat Autism Now.

DMSA Challenge Procedure:

• Empty bladder, discard urine.

• Take 1 500 mg DMSA capsule with a glass of water between meals (at least 1 hour before or after eating).

• Take a second 500 mg capsule 4 hours after the first.

• Collect total urine for 24 hours after taking the first capsule. Empty the bladder for the last
time at the same time of day the first DMSA capsule was taken on the previous day.

Variations on DMSA protocol:128, 129

• Mix and transfer a portion of urine to a specimen tube for analysis.

1. Take 500 mg DMSA twice daily for 1–2 days prior to collection day, and then follow the above protocol.

2. Base DMSA dosing on body weight, using 10–30 mg per kg of body weight per day as a single dose.
Collection of urine should commence after DMSA dose is taken, and continue for the next 24 hours.
Example for 110 lb. pt.: weight in kg (lb./2.2) x 10 mg/kg = 500mg DMSA

## Urinary Porphyrin Profiling

Hemoglobin is an iron protoporphyrin embedded in protein chains (globulins).131 The high rate of
activity for the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway leading
to heme makes it an excellent candidate for functional
testing of impediments to the enzymes that constitute
the pathway. Approximately 85% of heme biosynthesis
occurs in erythroid cells, with hepatic cells accounting
for the majority of the remainder. The cytochrome P450
systems in the liver require heme. Small activities of the
pathway are found in most tissues to supply heme for
the electron transport system. Even slight slowing of
the rate for any one of the porphyrin pathway enzymes
can cause abnormal concentrations of its substrate
to be detectable in urine. Since specific toxins have
been found to cause inhibitions of specific porphyrin
pathway enzymes, profiles of the various intermediates
can reveal whether an individual has had exposure to
lead,132 mercury133 or various organic toxins.134 Porphyrin elevations constitute a functional impairment of a
critical system that can have clinical effects such as anemia. Direct measurements of organic or metal toxins, on
the other hand, may reveal exposure that has no clinical
consequence. Various clinical effects of toxic metals
may be traced to their impairments in this pathway. A
detailed description of porphyrin testing is presented in
Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification.”

is routinely administered either orally or IV. When
completing a challenge protocol, urine is collected after
an approved time period, depending on DMSA delivery. Although DMSA is cleared by the kidneys in about
4 hours, some clinicians favor a 24-hour over a 6- to
8-hour urine collection. DMSA and EDTA chelation
challenge protocols are described in the “Of Further
Interest…” sidebar.
EDTA: Intravenous ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA) has been used as a therapy for atherosclerosis
and other age-associated diseases.125 The substance is
used in an IV drip solution in the form of the disodium magnesium or disodium calcium salt, which bind
with variable avidity to most divalent metal ions (See
Figure 3.5). Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated
for EDTA chelating therapy in a case of occupational
parkinsonism due to manganese exposure.126 EDTA is a
common food additive.
Some concern has arisen concerning the potential
for single-dose EDTA causing redistribution of endogenous toxic metals to tissues such as brain. However,
one study designed to demonstrate such a phenomenon
in rats failed to find any evidence for transient increase

Notes:

Figure 3.5 — The EDTA-Lead Chelate
EDTA allows hexadentate ligand structures, meaning
there are six atoms simultaneously coordinated with the
central metal ion. The EDTA molecule is called a chelate
from the word “chelos,” or claw, because it is able to
exert a claw-like grip on the central metal atom. The high
affinity for many divalent metal ions means that they will
readily transfer from most biological binding sites and
remain bound to EDTA until excreted in urine. The much
weaker calcium complex used in IV administration allows
displacement of calcium by the more tightly bound
heavy metals.

## The Major Elements

Calcium signaling is vital for hearing, given its role in
tuning cochlear hair cells.138 Calcium plays a major role
as a cofactor in the coagulation cascade.140 In addition
to its use as an adjunct treatment of osteoporosis,140
calcium supplementation has been used to modulate the
consequences of colorectal cancer,141, 142 kidney stones143
and hypertension144 (including preeclampsia145).

Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and phosphorus are present in the human body in hundred-gram
quantities. Since many hundreds of grams of calcium,
magnesium and phosphorus are present in the bones of
an adult, assessment of an individual’s status is a matter
of determining whether they are in time-averaged positive balance so that net loss from bone is avoided. For
sodium and potassium, in contrast, there is no comparable large, dynamic pool, so short term low intake
would produce large deficits of these elements except
for elaborate mechanisms (mainly renal) for regulating
their retention. In addition, we find many interactions
between specific elements and other nutrients and
toxicants. Thus, several levels of complexity complicate
clinical judgements about designing special support with
major elements to maintain optimal wellness.

Clinical Associations and
Assessment of Calcium Status

Calcium (Ca)

Clinical indications of deficiency: Osteoporosis, hypertension

Adequacy assessment: Hair or urine calcium, bone resorption
markers, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH
Optimal forms: Gluconate or citrate salts

Food sources: Dark green vegetables, whole grains, nuts, (milk)

Total-body calcium (Ca) is about 980 grams, which
is greater than any other element. The vast majority
of calcium resides in bone.32, 135 Calcium is essential
for bones and teeth, heart, nerves, muscles and blood
clotting.136, 137 Excitable and non-excitable cells require
calcium (via calcium-activated potassium channels) to
transmit impulses along nerves as well as participate
in smooth, cardiac and skeletal muscle cell contraction
or relaxation. Calcium’s actions are as wide ranging as
neuronal excitation, neurotransmitter release, innate immunity, hormonal secretion, and tone of smooth muscle
cells in the vasculature, airways, uterus, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and urinary bladder (Figure 3.6).138, 139
Notes:
Calcium circulating in blood is composed of approximately equal amounts of free calcium (ionized)
and albumin-bound calcium. Since low albumin levels
frequently, but not always, correspond to low calcium
levels, albumin testing should always be included with
serum calcium measurements. When blood calcium
drops, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted to initiate osteoclastic activity. PTH also stimulates activation
of vitamin D to calcitriol, increasing intestinal calcium
absorption to assist PTH.146 Working in tandem, PTH
and calcitriol also decrease urinary excretion of calcium.147 Calcium-lactate-gluconate and calcium carbonate supplementation (500 mg/d) of a calcium-deficient
human population resulted in a significant rise in mean
serum calcium and fall in serum alkaline phosphatase
compared with controls.148 Calcium and phosphorus
levels in serum are decreased in patients with liver cirrhosis without correlation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels.149 The involvement of calcitriol cannot be ruled
out in the cirrhotic patients, however, since metabolic
acidosis, which may accompany cirrhosis, was later
shown to decrease renal formation of calcitriol.150
Refer to Case Illustration 3.3

Serum calcium is generally measured as part of a
comprehensive metabolic panel, although it is not a
sensitive test for detecting early-stage calcium deficiency.
Serum calcium may be unaffected by physiological shifts
that affect calcium balance. For example, eclampsia is
associated with lowering of urinary calcium excretion,
whereas serum calcium is unaffected.151 Hypercalcemia
can signal hyperparathyroidism because PTH increases
calcium levels. Malignancies may also increase serum
calcium by either metastasis to bone (resulting in bone
resorption) or by ectopic production of PTH-like peptide by tumors.152 Symptoms of high calcium have been

Calcium (as Ca2+) is absorbed in the intestine and transported by calbindin to the enterocyte basolateral membrane where
it is pumped into portal blood by a calcium ATPase transporter (A). Vitamin D increases calcium absorption by inducing
calbindin synthesis. After absorption, calcium serves many functions in the body, including muscle cell contraction (B) and
neurotransmitter release (C). Ionic calcium also acts as a 2nd and 3rd messenger in intracellular signaling (not shown).

tation with magnesium and potassium citrate decreased
calcium stone reformation by 90%.162, 163 The complexity
of factors regulating calcium excretion complicate interpretation of urinary calcium. For example, in a cohort of
68 women with a history of calcium-based renal stones,
24-hour urine calcium levels were not found to accurately reflect dietary calcium intake.164
Unlike the narrow range for serum calcium, hair
calcium can vary from levels below 100 ppm to elevations as high as 5,000 ppm. Because of the unique
physiological controls maintaining circulating calcium,
levels in hair do not change in direct relation to intake,
so low levels do not generally correlate with calcium
deficiency. High hair calcium may be a marker for low
calcium intake and negative calcium balance. Parathyroid hormone strongly regulates the hair growth
cycle, providing a mechanism for regulation of calcium
incorporation into growing hair.179 Hair calcium levels
rise during adolescence, and, prior to age 60, adult
women have significantly higher mean levels of calcium
in hair than men of similar age.165-167 The greater calcium
mobilization due to estrogen fluxuations in females is
associated with 1.5 times higher calcium and magnesium in hair than males.165 Calcium levels were found to
be greater in females than males and tended to increase
with age in a Pakistani study of triplicate hair samples
from 58 male and 30 female Pakistanis from 3 to 100
years old.180 Patients with rickets and osteomalacia have
elevated hair Ca, whereas those with hypoparathyroidism have significantly decreased Ca concentrations in
hair.168 Low calcium intake and the associated elevation
of PTH may induce high levels of calcium in hair. High
dietary phosphorus and low calcium intake (a pattern
known to induce negative calcium balance) resulted in
as much as three times more calcium in hair compared
with controls.169 Both healthy females and Parkinson’s
disease females had 1.5 times higher calcium and magnesium in hair than males.165
Studies have shown low hair calcium is related to
increased incidence of coronary artery disease.170, 171 In
one study of 4,393 males in the UK, high water hardness
as well as higher hair calcium concentration and higher
sunshine hours were significantly associated with lower
coronary heart disease mortality. Arterial calcification
increases the likelihood of a coronary event.172,173
Bone loss may not always be accompanied by
high hair calcium. Because of the complexity of cellular
responses that can lead to bone loss, there may be

described as weakness, lack of energy, poor appetite,
nausea and vomiting, constipation, frequent urination,
or abdominal or bone pain.137
Low serum calcium levels have been seen in cases of
hypoparathyroidism, intestinal malabsorption, rhabdomyolysis, alkalosis and acute pancreatitis.147 Further
causes are low intake of calcium, vitamin D, or magnesium, or high intake of phosphorus.136
Calcium is primarily an extracellular element because cells carefully regulate calcium’s entry into the cell
for specific impulse transmission. It has been speculated that high levels of RBC calcium in hemodialysis
patients may be due to decreased Ca-ATPase activity or
toxic agents affecting cell membrane permeability.153 In
a study of hypertensives and diabetics, RBC potassium,
calcium, and magnesium were closely linked during
the fasting state.7 High levels of RBC calcium were seen
in 18 mild hypertensives compared with 14 healthy
controls.154 Significantly lower levels of red blood cell
calcium were found in 46 women with premenstrual
syndrome versus 50 controls.155 Since no consistent
clinical association has been established for low RBC
calcium, low limits may not be assigned by the clinical
laboratory. Because of potential membrane fluidity contributions to perturbed calcium transport, patients with
high RBC calcium may need investigation with RBC fatty
acid profiling (see Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids”).
Urine calcium indicates the amount of calcium
eliminated via the kidneys. Measurements of urinary
calcium are useful for monitoring therapy with patients known to be in negative calcium balance,156 or to
measure excretion in dosing studies.157 The importance
of associated ions for calcium absorption is indicated
by the greater urinary calcium excretion associated with
calcium sulfate-rich mineral water compared with milk
intake.158
In hypercalcemia, excess calcium is eliminated primarily through the urine.137 High rates of active vitamin
D formation may induce hypercalciuria.159, 160 Kidney
stones may be composed of calcium oxalate or calcium
phosphate, and high excretion of calcium appears to
increase the risk of developing kidney stones.140 Urinary
levels of calcium oxalate and calcium-creatinine ratios
were found to be significantly higher in stone-forming
children compared with normal children and may be
very useful in monitoring patients with urolithiasis.161
High urinary calcium resulting from low magnesium intake is associated with stone formation, and supplemen82

Calcium Repletion

Perhaps more than most elements, calcium balance
evaluation requires multiple markers, both functional
and direct. Biochemical tests of calcium tell only circulating levels of calcium and not the status of calcium
in the body’s principal reservoir, the skeleton. Since
calcium makes up a large percentage of bone, direct
measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) provides a
measure of calcium status, althouth they are too insensitive to detect short-term changes (several weeks).
Notes:

Optimal forms of calcium include gluconate and
citrate salts. Calcium repletion was achieved in a group
of 53 women using milk, calcium carbonate or calcium
carbonate with 1,200 IU of cholecalciferol when compared with controls.157 A note of caution is warranted
regarding the recommendation of milk consumption
for achieving optimal calcium status.181-183 Although
milk has appreciable calcium content, the net effect of
milk product intake on bone health is quite negative in
large-population comparison epidemiological studies.184
This subject is highly controversial, with ongoing strong
advocacy for positive calcium effects from regular milk
intake by children185 and adults.186 In addition to the
complexity of food intake and disease effects on calcium
regulation, economical and political factors may need to
be considered before reaching conclusions about milk
intake.184

Indirect Tests of Calcium Status

Evaluating BMD in cases such as osteoporosis requires
the use of tests such as a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or bone density scan.137 Biochemical testing
with markers such as alkaline phosphatase, hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine (see Chapter 4, “Amino Acids”),
N-telopeptide, deoxypyridinoline, and, if indicated, PTH
provide more tools for detecting short-term effects and
for monitoring treatment of osteoporotic patients. Other
tests recommended in the evaluation of osteoporosis are
25-hydroxyvitamin D, phosphate, creatinine, liver function tests, complete blood count, estrogen, testosterone
(in men), and thyroid-stimulating hormone.178

mechanisms unrelated to PTH (and hair calcium changes). For example, the urinary N-telopeptide type I collagen marker rose by 319% along with a 9.3% decrease
of bone density 9 months after gastric bypass surgery for
morbid obesity. These changes were not associated with
increased serum immunoreactive PTH or lowered serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D.174 Instead, changes in circulating
TNF-α or adiponectin are proposed to explain the bone
loss under these special conditions.175 Such mechanisms
may leave hair calcium unchanged in spite of high rates
of bone loss. Also, factors other than PTH changes may
result in the decline of hair calcium and magnesium
with increasing age, as found in patients with Parkinson’s disease.165
One confounding factor for interpreting measurements of hair calcium is that high mineral content in water (hard water) is known to be taken up by hair and can
vary widely across geographic location.176 Exogenous
deposition of metals such as calcium, lead, molybdenum
and strontium in hair have been shown to correlate with
levels in home water supplies.177

## Magnesium (Mg)

The kidney is the principle organ involved in
magnesium homeostasis. Drugs such as loop diuretics
(thiazide) that manipulate electrolyte resorption also
provoke renal magnesium loss.197, 198 Alkalosis increases
magnesium resorption, whereas acidosis increases excretion.199 Changes in dietary intake elicit altered renal
activity, increasing or decreasing resorption as needed.

Adequacy assessment: RBC, whole blood, plasma, serum, urine
Optimal forms: Lactate or aspartate salts
Clinical indications of deficiency: Muscle cramping, twitching,
depression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes
Food sources: Whole grains, nuts, legumes, molasses, brewer’s yeast

One of the most abundant elements on earth,
magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most plentiful cation in
mammals, and it is the dominant intracellular cation.
Magnesium plays a key role in more than 350 enzymes,
primarily as Mg-ATP complex in energy-dependent
activities (see Figure 3.7).187 According to the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
the mean magnesium intake for males and females
is 323 and 228 mg/d, respectively, far less than the
dietary reference intakes of 420 and 320 mg/d, respectively.188 Daily intakes of magnesium range between
84 and 598 mg.189 Total-body magnesium is about 25
grams, of which more than 50% resides in bone, 35%
in skeletal muscle and 1 to 2% in blood. 20% of blood
magnesium is protein bound. The bone pool is not
completely bioavailable when general depletion occurs.190 Similar to calcium, bone magnesium decreases
with age. Soft tissue magnesium concentration varies
between tissue types, and cellular transport is regulated
by numerous factors, including insulin, growth factors
and catecholamines.191, 192 Sex hormones have also been
demonstrated to impact total serum and ionized magnesium in women, depending on the time in menstrual
cycle.193, 194 The physiologic mechanism behind hormonal regulation is not currently understood, although
it may be associated with effects on magnesium-sensitive
enzymes, as in vitro studies have demonstrated significant tissue magnesium variation in the presence of sex
hormones.195
Magnesium is primarily absorbed in the jejunum
and ileum, likely via active transport, although the
exact mechanism is unknown.187, 196 Dietary magnesium
absorption is usually in the range of 35 to 40%. Parathyroid hormone, calcitonin and antidiuretic hormone
(ADH) increase magnesium absorption. Passive gastrointestinal paracellular absorption also occurs with
high intraluminal magnesium concentrations, allowing for greater systemic uptake, which is why there is
some concern regarding toxicity when using high-dose
magnesium for constipation.

Figure 3.7 — The Magnesium-ATP Complex
The Mg-ATP complex is a tetradentate ligand, where
four of the six coordination positions of magnesium are
bound to three ATP oxygen atoms and one ring nitrogen
atom. The binding to the first phosphate group is
mediated through a water molecule interposed between
it and the Mg2+ ion.

Magnesium is involved (as Mg-ATP) in virtually
every metabolic process occurring in the body,
including active transport such as the sodium-potassium
ATPase pump, and cell signaling, including cAMP
in protein phosphorylation. Magnesium is involved
in multiple steps of RNA and DNA synthesis. It also
plays structural roles in DNA, cell membranes and
chromosomes. Magnesium plays numerous key roles
in enzymes involved in protein, carbohydrate and fatty
acid metabolism. Examples include the amino acid
transaminases, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and delta-6
desaturase enzymes. Magnesium is a key cofactor in
both methylation and sulfur amino acid metabolism,
and is thus involved in the production of glutathione
and S-adenosylmethionine. Magnesium is also required
for formation of active cofactors from vitamins B1, B2, B3,
B6 and pantothenic acid.200

Clinical Associations of Magnesium

magnesium with calcium, magnesium has also been
demonstrated to increase iron212 and manganese213
gastrointestinal absorption and balance in magnesiumdeficient rats. Magnesium toxicity is rare, and usually of
iatrogenic origin.214

Assessment of Magnesium Status

Assessing magnesium status is challenging. Serum magnesium is the most commonly used specimen
for magnesium measurement.190 However, low serum
magnesium is not a sensitive test for magnesium deficiency for a number of reasons: Only 1% of total-body
magnesium is extracellular, and it is tightly regulated by
many factors, including parathyroid hormone, which
normalizes serum magnesium levels during low intake.
Whereas a low serum magnesium level is suggestive of
a deficiency, higher levels of serum magnesium correlate
poorly with total-body magnesium stores.
A better index of whole-body magnesium status is
the concentration of magnesium inside cells. Magnesium stores in muscle account for approximately 27% of
whole-body magnesium, representing a significant pool
of biologically active magnesium.215 There are a number
of reports associating magnesium levels in mononuclear
white blood cells (MBCs) with magnesium status.216-219
A significant correlation exists between the magnesium
concentration in MBCs and muscle. Like MBCs, red
blood cells contain appreciable amounts of magnesium.
The cellular composition of blood is 99% RBCs and less
than 1% MBCs. Thus the magnesium pool in RBCs is
significantly greater than that in MBCs. Although they
may not accurately reflect changes in total body status,
RBC specimens are frequently used to assess magnesium. Changes in RBC magnesium have been linked
to hypertension, premenstrual syndrome and chronic
fatigue syndrome.196,220 RBC magnesium has been demonstrated to be a more sensitive indicator of deficiency

Magnesium is often cited as the element most
deficient in modern diets.201 Estimates indicate that 40%
of the population in the United States have magnesium
status low enough to increase risk of degenerative diseases, including osteoporosis.202 Magnesium deficiency
is implicated in the pathogenesis of the leading causes
of death in the United States (see Table 3.4). Magnesium
intake was shown to be directly related to improved
insulin sensitivity in children203 and inversely related
to incidence of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in
the 1,223 men and 1,485 women of the Framingham
offspring cohort.204
Extracellular magnesium, comprising about 1 to
2% of total-body magnesium, is very tightly regulated.
However, subtle shifts in blood magnesium or a reduced calcium-magnesium ratio are found in diabetes
and other blood sugar dysregulatory conditions such as
polycystic ovarian syndrome.205, 206 The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which more than
9,000 Americans participated, demonstrated increased
incidence of diabetes for individuals with serum magnesium below 0.88 mmol/L.205, 207*
Since magnesium is involved in the active transport
of other ions, electrolyte imbalances are often associated with magnesium deficiency. Hypomagnesemia can
masquerade as refractory hypokalemia. In such cases,
active transport is compromised due to insufficient
magnesium, leading to reduction of intracellular potassium levels and renal potassium resorption.208 In these
instances, magnesium insufficiency frequently presents
as cardiovascular and neuromuscular symptomatology, including arrhythmia, hypertension and tetany.209
The antihypertensive effects of magnesium may also be
related to its involvement in moving calcium out of the
cell, allowing smooth muscle dilation. Further, magnesium is able to bind calmodulin and modulate calcium
signal transduction. Because of multiple tissue effects,
early signs of magnesium depletion are vague and often
missed, as they may be confused with other disorders.
In one study, 47% of 1,033 patients submitted for serum
electrolyte analyses were found to be hypomagnesemic,
using a cutoff of 0.74 mmol/L.210*
Frank deficiency may be caused by diarrhea, loop
diuretics and alcoholism. Therapeutic drugs (diuretics,
chemotherapeutics, immunosuppressive agents, anti­biotics)
can cause hypomagnesemia due to increased urinary
loss.211 In addition to the well-known relationship of

Notes:

* For Mg, 1 mmol/L = 24 µg/g = 24 ppm

than serum in insulin-dependent diabetic children.221 It
has been shown that RBC magnesium correlates better
with bone magnesium, the major storage site of body
magnesium, than muscle magnesium.222

requirements and specimen collection challenges, this
test is impractical for most clinics. A modification of
this test consists of an equivalent oral dose of magnesium in place of the IV route. Although adjusting for
variations in gastrointestinal absorption of magnesium
between patients does present a challenge, this form of
the test is considerably easier to conduct and deserves
further study.
A number of functional magnesium biomarkers
have been described for assessing magnesium status,
including C-reactive protein (CRP), thromboxane B2,
endothelin-1 and Na/K ATPase. Although all of these
are impacted by magnesium status, other factors can
also impact levels, such as CRP elevation in inflammation.228 There remains a need for a sensitive and specific
functional biomarker of magnesium status.

Magnesium Repletion Dosing

Repletion dosing for oral magnesium is up to 750
mg per day for adults; higher dosing may lead to diarrhea. The chloride, lactate, aspartate, glycinate and gluconate chelates of magnesium have high bioavailability,
whereas the oxide, carbonate and hydroxide forms are
poorly absorbed, and therefore may be used as osmotic
laxatives.196, 199, 229 IV magnesium is commonly given in
much higher doses, up to 10 grams or more over 24
hours in hypomagnesemia with intact renal function,
closely monitoring serum levels.230

With attention to caveats regarding the interpretation of results, hair can be a useful specimen for magnesium evaluation. Hair magnesium is representative of
long-term dietary habits, but the measured levels may
be inversely correlated with intake because they respond
to parathyroid hormone that is pulling magnesium (and
calcium) from bone to make up for insufficient dietary
intake. The above paradoxical presentation was demonstrated in an animal study and one human study.169,
Hair magnesium and calcium in female Parkinson’s
patients and controls was also shown to be 1.5 times
higher than their male counterparts, despite the fact
that these two elements have been found to be deficient
in Parkinson’s patients using other specimens.165, 224, 225
Furthermore, deficiency of magnesium is generally associated with calcium deficiency because they commonly
are present together in foods. This leads to the clinical
association of osteoporosis with insufficiency of both
elements.202, 226 Thus, elevated hair magnesium and calcium may be indicative of mobilization of the elements
from bone to replenish depleted stores in metabolically
active tissues. Conversely, low hair magnesium may not
be indicative of magnesium deficiency.
An important mechanism for magnesium conservation is kidney tubular reabsorption.227 During periods
of magnesium depletion, kidney magnesium excretion is markedly reduced. Therefore, in the presence
of normal renal function, reduced urine magnesium
is indicative of low magnesium intake. It should be
kept in mind, however, that this test can reflect recent
decrease in dietary magnesium despite normal cellular
levels. This limitation can be overcome by conducting a
magnesium load-retention test. As originally described,8
this functional test consists of infusing 2.4 mg Mg/kg
lean body weight and collecting pre- and post-injection
24-hour urines that are assayed for magnesium and
creatinine. Retention of magnesium greater than 25% of
the load indicates magnesium deficiency. The increase
of post-challenge over pre-challenge urine magnesium
should be greater than 180 mg/d. However, due to time

Refer to Case Illustration 3.4
Potassium (K)
Adequacy assessment: RBC potassium, serum, hair
Optimal forms: Citrate or chloride salts
Clinical indications of deficiency: Hypertension, stroke, kidney
stones, osteoporosis
Food sources: Avocado, banana, mango, corn on the cob, dried
beans, potatoes, tomatoes

Potassium (K) is the most abundant intracellular cation in eukaryotic cells. Only 2% of total-body
potassium is extracellular.231 The average human body
potassium concentration of 800 mmol/L (or 140 grams)
accounts for the recommended dietary intake of nearly
5,000 mg/d. Dietary deficiency of potassium frequently
goes undiagnosed because the element is ubiquitous in
fruits and vegetables, and symptoms are generally vague
and non-specific. Consuming a diet high in processed
foods and in sodium, can easily result in a mild, chronic
hypokalemia.231

Potassium is vital for triggering the action potential for muscle and nerve cell activity. Potassium
channels include voltage-gated, calcium-activated, and
ligand-gated/G-protein coupled potassium channels.
Potassium channels are membrane proteins important
in neurotransmitter release, cell excitability, hormone
secretion, heart rate, and tone of vasculature and smooth
muscle.138 Potassium channel distribution in neuronal
dendrites and how these channels dictate multiple factors in neuronal activity have been reviewed.232 Alterations of potassium channels are associated with cardiac
failure,233 cerebral ischemia234 and nerve injury.235

mortality caused by hyperkalemia is due to the consequences on cardiac function. High extracellular potassium is rectified with calcium chloride, alkalizing agents
or diuretics.255 There is no evidence that hyperkalemia
can arise from intake of potassium-rich foods.

Assessment of Potassium Status

Potassium insufficiency has been implicated in
stroke,58, 59, 236 cardiac dysfunction, hypertension,237, 238
renal stone formation,143, 239 hypercalciuria,240 and postmenopausal osteoporosis.231, 241-243 Potassium is important in maintaining acid-base equilibrium and in insulin
sensitivity,231, 244-246 and it has been suggested to play a
role in neurological complaints (including schizophrenia
and brain injury)247 and gastroesophogeal reflux disorder
(GERD).248-250 Increased potassium intake reduces incidence of stroke and decreases hypertension,58, 59, 61, 236,
possibly by a potassium-induced decrease in platelet
aggregation.237 In 59 volunteers, supplementation of
potassium chloride, at 24 mmol/d for 6 weeks, lowered
mean arterial pressure by 7.01 mm Hg, systolic blood
pressure by 7.60 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure
by 6.46 mm Hg.238 It has been argued that magnesium
and potassium therapy should be “first-line therapy” in
drug-induced arrhythmias or digitalis overdose as well
as in treatment of congestive heart failure.252
Hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5
mEq/L) is the most severe consequence of potassium
depletion, resulting in neuromuscular, gastrointestinal
and cardiac conduction dysfunction. It can be caused by
diarrhea, vomiting, low intake, increased renal excretion
or even hypomagnesemia, due to magnesium’s involvement in potassium pump activity. Drugs can induce
hypokalemia, especially diuretics,253 and can increase the
risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke and myocardial infarction.254
Hyperkalemia (serum potassium of more than 5.5
mEq/L) is potentially life threatening and is caused by
decreased potassium excretion or increased extracellular
potassium due to inappropriate IV therapy, medications
or potassium-sparing diuretic use. The morbidity and

Clinical Associations of Potassium

Red blood cells may be the best specimen for
assessing intracellular potassium status.256 In men, a
significant inverse relationship was found between
RBC potassium and hypertension and blood pressure,
whereas there was a positive association between RBC
sodium and hypertension in women. However, these associations were more profound in older versus younger
participants (n = 1,805).257 A study of 100 adolescents
showed low RBC potassium to be associated with hypertensive parents, and therefore a possible sign of future
hypertension development.258 The potassium-dependent
cardiac repolarization phase measured by electrocardiogram was found to correlate with RBC potassium
levels in an elderly population. On the other hand, the
correlation with serum potassium levels was poor.256, 259
Whole-blood potassium can be useful for whole-body
potassium assessment since it includes RBC potassium;
however, care must be taken to assure that conditions
inducing serum potassium fluctuations are considered.
In mild to moderate chronic renal failure, serum
potassium will elevate.260 Because potassium is primarily
cytosolic, dietary effects on serum potassium are slight
at best.237 Nor is serum potassium a good marker for
assessing hypertensive risk associated with potassium
status.261
Notes:

ECF and intracellular fluid (ICF) allow water to pass into
the cells in excess, leading to symptoms of water toxicity,
including apathy, muscle twitching and loss of appetite.
When both sodium and water are lost, total blood
volume decreases, causing hypotension, tachycardia
and other heart disturbances.135 Prolonged imbalances
in ECF and ICF can become serious emergencies.
Excessive sodium intake is widely considered to be a
risk factor in certain cases of hypertension, and frequent
monitoring with 24-hour urinary sodium measurements
is recommended to help educate patients who need to
lower sodium intake.276 Magnesium deficiency has been
demonstrated to impact electrolytes, including sodium,
potassium and calcium.208

Phosphorous (P)

Phosphorous (P) ranks second in abundance in
human tissue after calcium, with total-body stores of 700
grams. Eighty-five percent of phosphorous resides in
bone as hydroxyapatite, a combination of phosphate and
calcium ions, whereas the remaining 15% exists in every
cell in the body. Phosphorus as inorganic phosphate is
essential for DNA, RNA and ATP formation. Phosphate
is also a key constituent in cell membranes as phospholipid and is involved in most second messenger signaling
pathways, including cAMP. Serum phosphorus is regulated by PTH, but not as closely as calcium. Phosphorus
is highly bioavailable with 60 to 70% being absorbed in
the GI tract. The element (as phosphate) is plentiful in
most foods as it is similarly utilized for nuclear material and second messenger activity in both plants and
animals. Phosphorus is also present in processed foods,
particularly soft drinks.33
An inverse relationship exists between calcium and
phosphorus. A low serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca/P)
ratio, brought on by diet, is implicated in bone loss and
has been referred to as “nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism,” where high-normal blood PTH levels are
associated with increased bone resorption and decreased
serum calcitriol. This condition is a concern for adolescent girls, as the combination of poor calcium intake
and excess soft drink consumption can compromise
peak bone mass accumulation. Examples of high phosphorus foods include macaroni and cheese (322 mg per
cup), pizza (216 mg per slice) and cola (46 mg per 12
ounces). The two latter foods also contain high calcium,
whereas the soda does not. Elderly patients with a low
serum Ca/P ratio are at increased risk for osteoporosis33, 277

Potassium Repletion Dosing

If renal failure is not present, urinary potassium
excretion accurately reflects potassium intake on the day
the specimen was collected.262 Urinary potassium reflects
potassium intake and fruit and vegetable intake.263 Some
epidemiologic studies have shown that urinary potassium is significantly less in African-Americans, whether
on random or controlled diets.237, 264-270 Urinary potassium correlates with bone density at femoral, neck and
lumbar spine as well as total-body bone density, independent of lean body mass in children.263 Urinary potassium was found to be low in patients with untreated
interstitial cystitis, presumably due to epithelial leakage
of potassium, whereas heparin treatment resulted in
increased urinary potassium.271 Kidney stone formers
are characterized by high urinary calcium, and potassium appears to decrease stone formation by decreasing
urinary calcium levels. Conversely, low potassium intake
results in higher calcium urinary levels.143, 239
Hair potassium levels decrease after prolonged
alcoholism, apparently showing chronic deprivation of
hair follicles during their active growth phase.272 Studies
with cystic fibrosis indicate that when there is normal
potassium retention by the soft tissues, hair potassium
remains normal.273

The minimum potassium requirement is 1,800
to 2,000 mg/d,33 whereas the adequate intake dose is
4,700 mg/d.274 Food sources supplying these levels are
well tolerated, but treatment by oral supplementation is
limited by gastrointestinal tolerance. In severe deficiency,
IV potassium administration allows more rapid repletion, but careful monitoring of serum levels is needed
during administration because sudden elevation of
serum potassium outside the usual narrow physiological
range can lead to severe cardiac distress. Citrate, chloride and bicarbonate salts of potassium have been used
for therapy and for investigations of potassium effects.
Oral doses of 96 mmol (7,200 mg/d) for potassium
chloride or potassium citrate were found to decrease
blood pressure in hypertensives.275

Sodium (Na)
Sodium (Na) along with chloride comprise the
major electrolytes of the body’s extracellular fluid
(ECF). Sodium deficiency is rarely considered outside
of unusual circumstances of losses due to vomiting and
diarrhea or sweating. In such cases, the imbalance in

Phosphate deficiency may occur in the elderly, or
those taking phosphate-binding antacids. Given the
ubiquitous role of phosphate, symptoms are disparate,
resulting primarily from decreased ATP production
and involve neuromuscular, skeletal and hematological
systems.
Blood and urine specimens are used to evaluate
phosphorus status as part of profiles to diagonse
parathyroid, bone and calcium disorders, vitamin D
imbalances, and kidney abnormalities.147

## Trace Elements

cell surfaces to balance absorption, storage, circulation
and excretion of iron. Absorption of non-heme iron is
mediated by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)
(Figure 3.8), among others. This transporter is upregulated in iron deficiency. Toxic elements such as
cadmium and lead share the same transporter, and
it may be the reason that iron deficiency predisposes
humans to cadmium and lead toxicity. By the same
token, an iron-replete diet may protect from other
element toxicities.98, 282, 283 There is no mechanism to
excrete excess iron by the body, though small amounts
of iron are lost through urine, bile and sloughing of
intestinal mucosal cells in the feces. This loss amounts
to less than 1 mg/d,281, 284 so the daily need of iron is
about 1 to 1.5 mg for healthy adults. The RDA is much
higher, reflecting low GI absorption of iron in healthy
individuals. Premenopausal women are subject to a
much greater loss of iron during menstruation.
Toxic elements can “piggy back” on the homeostatic
mechanisms for iron regulation and can pose a second
adverse consequence for the patient with either extremely high iron stores or for the patient with iron deficiency.
DMT1 mediates absorption of iron, manganese, cadmium, and lead,98 and some toxic elements use transferrin
as their carrier protein (e.g., aluminum).295

## Iron (Fe)

Adequacy assessment: Ferritin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, total iron
binding capacity, transferrin saturation
Iron excess: Transferrin saturation

Clinical indications of deficiency: Fatigue, delay in growth or
cognitive development, weakness, arthralgias, organ damage

Food sources: Organ meats, brewer’s yeast, wheat germ, egg yolk,
oyster, dried beans, and some fruits

Optimal forms: Ferrous gluconate, fumarate, and citrate salts;
combine with ascorbate

It has been estimated that 6 of 100 Americans are in
negative iron balance, whereas 1 of 100 have iron (Fe)
overload.278 Iron overload can be caused by a common
genetic disorder in the United States. There are only
about 2.5 to 4 grams of iron in the healthy human body,
yet this element has critical functions, and the human
body has an intricate system of maintaining homeostasis.
Human understanding of iron and anemia has a long
history, and therefore a wealth of information is available
on its absorption, transport, storage and biochemical
roles, as well as appropriate laboratory evaluation.
Hemoglobin contains 70% of total-body iron. Another 3.9% is found in myoglobin and in mitochondrial
proteins involved in energy metabolism and respiration
such as cytochromes, catalase, peroxidase and metalloflavoprotein enzymes.279, 280 Plasma iron is largely bound
to transport proteins (mainly ferritin, transferrin and
albumin), leaving only 0.1% of total-body iron as free
iron in plasma.281
Dietary sources of iron include heme iron (meat)
or non-heme iron (iron-rich plants), which is less
bioavailable. Homeostasis of iron is carried out by up- or
down-regulation of transferrin and ferritin receptors on

Iron Deficiency Anemia
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) has effects on tissue
and cardiac health, physiological growth, productivity,
maternal and fetal mortality, cognitive development, and
attention span.281, 284 Although hemoglobin (Hb) is routinely measured to monitor the critical stages of anemia,
Hb is not the most sensitive marker of iron deficiency
which advances in stages, starting with decreased iron
stores (ferritin) and ultimately ending in effects on erythrocytes. Figure 3.9 shows the stages of iron deficiency,
Notes:

including depletion of iron stores, iron-deficient erythropoeises and, finally, IDA. Severe anemia is associated
with hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL. At this stage
metabolic acidosis occurs because of failure for compensation of decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.285
Iron deficiency is a common nutrient deficiency in
the United States and worldwide, affecting mainly older
infants, young children and women of childbearing
age. Causes of iron deficiency can be grouped into four
categories: (1) low dietary intake of iron, (2) gastrointestinal blood loss, (3) poor absorption of iron and (4)
increased iron requirements (see Figure 3.1). Inadequate
dietary levels of vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamins A, C,

or E, or trace elements contribute to development of
IDA. Malaria and hemoglobinopathies also decrease iron
levels.286 Testing iron status is most important in those at
high risk of developing iron deficiency anemia: pregnant
women, infants, adult females and adolescent females, in
that order.280

Chronic Iron Excess

In addition to clinical concern over iron deficiency,
the question of excessive iron has received attention
because of the realization that free iron greatly increases
non-specific oxidation reactions that are involved in free
radical degenerative effects.287 The Fenton reaction is

In the apical surface of enterocytes, DMT1 is the primary transporter for non-heme iron and it also can transport manganese,
cadmium and lead. The figure illustrates the difference between the iron-sufficient state (1) and iron deficiency (2). Irondeficiency stimulates expression of DMT1 resulting in greater rates of absorption of iron. The concurrent increased absorption
of lead and cadmium can produce higher risk of toxic tissue exposure. At the basolateral surface, other transport proteins,
especially ferroportin mediate movement of iron, manganese and toxic elements into portal circulation.

A specific protein-bound iron accrual occurs in
hereditary hemochromatosis that has been found to
occur at a frequency of 0.44% in non-Hispanic whites
in North America, but at lesser frequencies in other
groups.290 Iron overload disorders have been covered in

Figure 3.9 — Iron Biomarkers in Iron Deficiency and Iron Overload
Moving from left to right, the table presents the progression of iron status from toxic overload to iron deficiency anemia. The
three elliptical regions represent stored, circulating (free) and erythron (erythrocytes plus erythropoietic tissue) iron pools.
Circulating and erythron iron are the last to be depleted. The data in the table are laboratory cutoffs and shaded regions
show the most sensitive markers for iron excess (transferrin saturation %) and the stages of iron depletion. Ferritin is elevated
in iron overload, but it also rises due to inflammation. In the “Normal” column, iron status is replete but not excessive,
and all laboratory values are within normal limits. Iron depletion, iron deficient erythropoiesis, and iron deficiency anemia
are reflected by sequential changes in biomarkers as deficiency worsens. Erythrocytes are the last to show evidence of iron
deficiency. Thus ferritin is a better indicator of iron deficiency than hemoglobin.278,280

various review articles.291, 292 Symptoms include extreme
fatigue, arthralgias, and loss of libido.293 Because consequences of iron overload include hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis and diabetes, neonatal screening for hemochromatosis has been recommended. Life expectancy is normal
if hemochromatosis is detected early. Typically, serum
transferrin and iron saturation is used to detect early
iron excess. If abnormal, these tests are followed by, or
used in conjunction with, serum ferritin to detect hemochromatosis. Serum ferritin over 300 ng/mL for men and
over 150 ng/mL for women is abnormal.294,292 If repeat
tests (while fasting) are abnormal, genotype testing can
be used as a confirmatory test of hemochromatosis.292

Assessing Iron Status

Due to the body’s complex homeostatic controls on
elemental concentrations in body tissues and fluids, testing of multiple specimens may be needed to accurately
assess status. Iron provides a good example, as summarized in Table 3.6, showing markers for detecting ID,
IDA, iron excess and hemochromatosis.147, 278, 297, 298
Routine hematological markers of iron status include Hb, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV),
mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and erythrocyte count.299
The biochemical tests are generally more accurate,
though more expensive and difficult.297 They include
serum iron, serum transferrin, transferrin saturation,
serum ferritin,300 total iron-binding capacity (TIBC),
transferrin receptor,301 erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP)
and the zinc protoporphyrin heme ratio test.302 Bone
marrow aspiration or measuring hemoglobin response to
iron administration are definitive diagnostic markers of
iron deficiency.303 However, bone marrow aspiration may
be excessively intrusive, and the oral iron challenge test
increases free radical oxidative damage to lipoproteins
and cell membranes.304
Hemoglobin is a measure of iron incorporated into
the red blood cells. This test is low cost, easy, and fast
and appears to be better than hematocrit.297 For IDA,
hemoglobin must be measured before and several weeks

Acute iron toxicity in the adult is possible but
requires enormous quantities of iron. The lethal dose of
elemental iron is 200 to 250 mg/kg. The tolerable upper
limit (UL) is 45 mg/d of iron, based on the occurrence of
gastrointestinal side effects.296 The main victims of iron
toxicity are children who overdose on 10 or more iron
tablets. The symptoms of overdose manifest largely in
the gut as necrotizing gastroenteritis, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, shock, lethargy and dyspnea.
The remedy for iron toxicity is bowel irrigation, administration of desferrioxamine (DFO), and phlebotomy.284
A more recent iron chelator class is available, one of
which is called deferasirox, and may become the main
treatment modality for those with hemochromatosis.
Dietary treatment for iron excess includes removing iron
supplementation, vitamin C, and alcohol while reducing
intake of organ meats and red meats. Increased phytate
consumption such as legumes, whole grains, brown rice
and wheat bran may also be used to lower non-heme
iron absorption.

Acute Iron Toxicity

Ferritin

biochemical indicators of iron deficiency are infection,
malignancy, malnutrition, alcoholism or liver disease.297
Transferrin saturation (TSat) and serum ferritin have
been called the cornerstones of iron status assessment.
Transferrin is the transport protein of iron. TSat is the
percentage of transferrin bound to iron and is a good
indicator of iron availability to the bone marrow. Fasting
TSat is the earliest indicator of hemochromatosis. High
serum ferritin is less sensitive, but should be considered
if inflammation can be ruled out as the cause of elevated
serum ferritin. DNA testing alone can miss 20 to 40% of
whites and most blacks with hemochromatosis, so TSat is
preferred.314 Another common measurement of iron status is the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). TIBC is the
maximum amount of iron that serum proteins will bind.
Serum iron concentration is decreased in many,
but not all, patients with IDA, chronic inflammatory
disorders and myocardial infarction. Elevated serum
iron occurs in hemochromatosis, acute hepatitis, blood
transfusions such as in sickle cell anemia, and excessive
supplemental iron ingestion. Measurements of serum
iron, TIBC and TSat are most useful for screening iron
overload disorders, rather than for the diagnosis of depleted total-body iron pools.315
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) and serum zinc
protoporphyrin (ZnPP or ZP) are metabolic markers of
the effect of iron deficiency on the pathway for heme
biosynthesis. The insertion of ferric iron, a final event in
heme formation, is under the control of ferrochelatase.
In the absence of iron, this enzyme inserts zinc instead
of iron, producing ZP. Thus, an abnormal ZP or ZPheme ratio is a sensitive, functional marker capable of
detecting preanemic iron deficiency.316 The tight linkage
of changes of ZP with ferritin shows that an early effect
of iron deficiency is iron-deficient erythropoiesis.317 In
a study of 2,613 children and 5,175 women, EP was
found to be a superior screening tool for iron deficiency
in children aged 1 to 5 years, whereas Hb and EP were
equally specific and sensitive for screening non-pregnant women.297 Other studies have demonstrated that
ZP and EP are more sensitive than Hb for detecting iron
deficiency, especially at early stages.318 In one study, EP
was more sensitive but less specific than Hb for detecting IDA.318, 319 The sensitivity of ZP and hematocrit
was 81% and 16%, respectively, for identifying young
children responsive to iron therapy.320 For patients already depleted in iron, the earliest sign of repletion was
heme synthesis via protoporphyrin levels.305 For more

after iron supplementation. In one study, premenopausal
women were depleted in iron and then fed iron-supplemented diets. The relative sensitivities for detecting
depletion of iron were, in decreasing order, as follows:
ferritin, percent transferrin saturation (TSat), plasma
iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin.305 Reticulocyte hemoglobin may produce
less variability than serum ferritin and TSat.306,307
Some limitations of hemoglobin are that it detects
only late-stage iron deficiency and has been reported to
detect only 25 to 37% of iron-deficient patients.131,297
Schneider and colleagues showed that in a sample of
425 toddlers from low-income families in California,
hemoglobin had a low sensitivity for predicting iron
deficiency (ID) of 23 to 40%, meaning that about 60 to
77% would not have been identified based on hemoglobin testing alone.298 Warning against the use of hemoglobin in screening for ID is significant, especially because
ID, not only IDA, can cause developmental delays308
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
symptoms.309
Decreased serum ferritin serves as an early sign of
declining stores of body iron. Serum ferritin reflects iron
stores because it is the major iron storage protein, and it
appears to be the most sensitive test to determine irondeficiency anemia147 (Figure 3.9). Exceptions to this rule
are cases of cancer, infection, inflammation and liver disease,310, 311 where serum ferritin can appear normal, but
iron administration may reduce mortality. Also, because
serum ferritin increases with the severity of protein-energy malnutrition,312 it is risky to rely on serum ferritin
levels and/or transferrin saturation in patients with
inflammation (such as hemodialysis patients), who may
have falsely elevated iron status, but actually need iron
administration.306 Further, serum ferritin can be normal
in patients with cardiac iron overload leading to cardiomyopathies.313 Such responses highlight the challenge
for determining the true iron sufficiency state.306
Serum ferritin increases with inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and IL-10, presumably
mediated by IL-1 and TNF-α.306 In 58,000 hemodialysis patients, serum ferritin of 200 to 1,200 ng/mL
and transferrin saturation levels of 30 to 50% had no
association with cardiovascular or all-cause mortality
when adjusted for markers of inflammation and malnutrition. These patients had improved survival with
IV iron (≤ 400 mg/month) when compared with the
control group.306, 312 Other conditions reported to affect

## Zinc (Zn)

detailed information about the porphyrin pathway, see
Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification.”
Abnormal serum ferritin and ZnPP identified hemodialysis patients who would show an increased hematocrit when intravenous iron dextran was administered.321
Ferritin reflects the iron stores, whereas ZnPP indicates
whether the ID in a given patient is clinically relevant
or not. The measured ZnPP, hemoglobin concentration
and red cell indices can reveal the extent of a clinically
relevant ID.322

Adequacy assessment: Metallothionein, plasma, hair, or RBC Zn,
delta 6 desaturase activity
Optimal forms: Gluconate, amino acid chelates
Clinical indications of deficiency: Depressed growth, poor immune
function, alopecia, eye and skin lesions, diarrhea
Food sources: Red meat, oysters, whole grains

Depending on the stage of ID, 1 to 5 mg of dietary iron intake may be actually absorbed, the mean
for men being somewhat less than for women (1.0 vs.
1.4 mg/d).280 Men absorb less iron per day because their
iron stores are greater than those of women. An anemic
person, with low iron stores and low hemoglobin, can
absorb 50% more non-heme iron than a person with
adequate iron stores.296 Administration of vitamin C improves iron bioavailability and has been shown to significantly improve markers of iron status.305,323 Prophylactic
vitamin C supplementation alone may prevent ID.324
Other commonly used forms of iron supplementation are ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate. Treatment regimens may use elemental iron as high as 200
mg per day for adults and 100 mg per day for children.
However, in extreme cases of IDA, up to 480 mg per
day has been used to achieve rapid results.280 Frequent
monitoring of iron status should be done if this treatment is continued for several months.284 Response to
iron supplementation should be almost immediately
evident in the hemoglobin levels (Figure 3.9) and the
patient will feel an increase in energy, but iron stores will
not be replete for months. Intramuscular iron injections
have been shown to be more effective in improving
ferritin levels than oral supplementation over 1 month
of treatment, but proper protocol must be followed to
minimize pain and avoid tattooing.325

Iron Repletion Dosages

Zinc is necessary for growth and development of
all living organisms due to its role in numerous catalytic
and regulatory enzymes and in protein folding and receptor binding. It is a cofactor for more than 300 known
enzymes. Of trace elements, zinc is second only to iron
in body content at 2 to 3 g, found largely in the intracellular compartment of tissues such as the liver, pancreas,
kidney, bone and muscles, with smaller concentrations
in the eye, prostate, fingernails, hair and skin.330
Zinc fingers that regulate gene expression represent
a key structural role of zinc in proteins. They contain zinc atoms usually bound to cysteine or histidine
residues of the protein (see Figure 3.10). It appears that
approximately 1% of the human genome codes for zinc
fingers326 that have important roles in the functions of
DNA, RNA, and transcription of receptor factors for
retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. They
are also involved in regulation of receptor binding, cell
cycling and cell-cell signaling.327

Notes:
Clinical Associations of Zinc
Symptoms of mild and severe zinc deficiency
include depressed growth, teratogenesis, poor carbohydrate metabolism, altered cognition, poor immune
function, alopecia, impotence, eye and skin lesions, and
diarrhea.328-330 Low dietary zinc has been associated with
hypogonadism,33 low testosterone,331 low free T4332 and
low IGF-1,333 revealing the importance of zinc in steroidhormone gene transcription.330 Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a genetic disease that results in zinc malabsorption. It is characterized by eczematoid skin lesions,
alopecia, diarrhea, bacterial and yeast infections, and can
be fatal,33 but is reversible with zinc supplementation.327
Although the immune dysfunction seen in zinc deficiency is not well understood, animal studies show that
zinc deficiency results in thymic atrophy and lowered Thelper cell function.334 In children, zinc supplementation
improves T-lymphocyte responsiveness.335 Interleukins
1 and 6 are mediators in zinc metabolism, initiating zinc
uptake into liver, bone marrow and thymus, possibly as

a host defense mechanism.327, 336 However, zinc supplementation to increase immune function has conflicting
evidence; in HIV patients, low serum zinc is associated
with increased mortality,337, 338 and zinc supplementation (45 mg/d) decreased the number of opportunistic
infections.339
Although research supports a toxic dose of zinc of
100 to 300 mg/d and an upper limit of 40 mg/d, 100
mg/d is commonly used for short-term repletion. The
main toxic effect is that zinc interferes with copper
absorption. Zinc supplementation of 2 g/d causes GI
symptoms and vomiting. Toxicity is rare, primarily seen
in hemodialysis patients where the dialysis fluids were

contaminated with zinc. Symptoms include anemia,
fever and central nervous system effects. Zinc exposure
from welding has been documented.33

Homeostatic Mechanisms

Zinc is believed to enter enterocytes by active transport when body status is low and by the paracellular
(passive) route in the zinc-replete state. Thus, as with
other elements, zinc deficiency is offset by increasing absorption, whereas zinc excess causes increased excretion.
The metal-binding protein, metallothionein (MT) binds
zinc in the enterocyte and transports it to the basolateral
border, where it is actively exported from the cell and

A double strand of DNA with multiple zinc fingers (Znfn) bound to the DNA surface is shown. The Znfn close-up shows the
finger-like loops of amino acids stabilized by a single zinc atom. The zinc binds to cysteine and histidine side chains. Zinc
fingers are epigenetic transcription and post-transcription factors involved in regulating gene expression. In other cellular
locations, zinc fingers are involved in cell regulation and signal transduction. They are among the most abundant proteins
coded for in the eukaryotic genome, and mutations of zinc fingers are associated with numerous conditions, including
schizophrenia, myeloid leukemia, Wilms’ tumor and other cancers.

Assessing Zinc Status

bound to albumin for delivery to tissues (Figure 3.11).
Albumin is the principal carrier of zinc, although some
zinc may be carried by transferrin and prealbumin. Diseases of malabsorption such as Crohn’s disease impair
zinc status.33 Zinc fecal excretion ranges from 1 mg/d in
deficient individuals to 5 mg/d in zinc-replete individuals.329 Fecal zinc losses occur in the form of pancreatic
secretions and intestinal cell turnover.340 Urinary zinc
comprises less than 10% of fecal zinc excretion.341

Figure 3.11 — Zinc Absorption and Distribution
Dietary zinc arrives at the absorptive region of the small
intestine complexed with various counter-ions, especially
the amino acids released from digestion of dietary
proteins (see Chapter 7, “GI Function”). Divalent metal
transporters in the enterocyte brush border release zinc
ions into the cytosolic zinc pool where they equilibrate
with zinc transiently bound to metallothionein or
incorporated into zinc metalloproteins. Metallothionein
transports intracellular zinc from the lumen to the
basolateral border for exit. In the blood, zinc is bound
to albumin, its principal protein carrier. The rates and
directions of transfer respond to changes in dietary zinc
supply and blood concentrations of zinc.
To date, there is no generally accepted standard
index for zinc status, although levels of zinc in whole
blood, plasma, blood cells and urine tend to fall in severe zinc depletion. Accurate assessment of zinc status is
difficult and studies are often contradictory. MT appears
to be a valuable marker of zinc status.327, 330, 342 Plasma
and serum are thought to be insensitive indicators of
zinc status.327, 330, 342 However, some studies have shown
plasma to respond to both depletion and repletion of
zinc,343, 344 and for this reason, some experts recommend using both plasma zinc and erythrocyte MT as an
indicator of zinc status.106, 327 Erythrocyte zinc has been
shown to be both responsive342 and non-responsive343 to
zinc depletion.327, 330,345 Erythrocyte zinc may be useful
primarily due to high concentration of zinc enzymes
such as carbonic anhydrase. Other enzymes such as
erythrocyte membrane alkaline phosphatase can serve
as supportive measures when assessing zinc status.344
Urinary zinc has also been shown to be a useful biomarker,330, 344 and even to correlate with plasma zinc levels,343 yet it has also been shown to be a poor indicator
for early stages of zinc depletion.342 Hair zinc correlates
with zinc supplementation-induced growth,330 yet others
have shown no relationship between hair zinc and zinc
status.343 Ultimately, gathering multiple measurements of
zinc status is ideal in an effort to put together the puzzle
of a patient’s total-body zinc status.
Blood accounts for a mere 0.5% of the total-body
content of zinc. Blood zinc is partitioned between
plasma (12–22%), leukocytes and platelets (3%) and
erythrocytes (75–88%). Plasma zinc may fluctuate with
dietary intake or inflammation and can be decreased
by 50% after an injury.33 Many zinc nutrition studies
have relied on measurements of plasma zinc levels.112
Plasma zinc represents the dynamic balance of systems
regulating absorption of dietary zinc, tissue uptake and
efflux.342, 346 Normal fasting plasma zinc concentration is
650 to 980 µg/L or 0.65 to 0.98 ppm.106, 330 Zinc levels
are lowered after meals.347 Although plasma zinc concentration is clinically useful, the results can be complicated
by conditions of acute stress and illness, such as following myocardial infarction, where zinc can rise because of
increased binding protein levels.348
Furthermore, since plasma zinc is largely bound to
albumin, any treatment that alters albumin levels will
alter plasma zinc concentration. For example, corticosteroids, oral contraceptives and pregnancy lower plasma

Eighty five percent of erythrocyte zinc is bound to
carbonic anhydrase (CA) and 5% to superoxide dismutase (ZnSOD), where zinc plays a structural role. CA
is involved in acid-base balancing, and ZnSOD catalyzes
the dismutation of super oxides to hydrogen peroxide
and water.327 In a study of non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease patients (n = 38), high levels of carbonic
anydrase correlated with zinc levels in erythrocytes.356
Other zinc-containing enzymes in blood such as alkaline
phosphatase, nucleoside phosphorylase and ribonuclease are responsive to changes in zinc status.363 Zincdeficient patients who received zinc supplementation
showed increases in serum alkaline phosphatase activity
that paralleled the degree of zinc repletion.364 Similar
studies that measured alkaline phosphatase activity in
erythrocytes have shown this membrane enzyme to be
responsive to zinc depletion, even when other markers,
including plasma, erythrocyte and platelet zinc concentrations failed to change in early zinc deficiency.344,
Another zinc-dependent marker with promise as a
sensitive indicator of mild zinc deficiency is the plasma
enzyme, 5′-nucleotidase.366
When low erythrocyte or plasma zinc is found, testing the patient’s plasma amino acids may be indicated.
Zinc may be absorbed as a peptide, bound to amino
acids such as cysteine and methionine.367 Therefore, normal levels of methionine, taurine, cysteine and histidine
may support zinc absorption (Figure 3.11).33, 367, 368 On
the other hand, excessive levels of histidine intake can
deplete zinc.369

Notes:

zinc.349 Serum levels rise then decrease after meals.33
Compared with controls, serum zinc was elevated in
patients with atherosclerosis obliterans.350 In 15 young
males, plasma zinc decreased significantly on 3.2 mg
zinc/d for 42 days. However, a decrease wasn’t seen in
the groups fed 7.2 or 15.2 mg zinc/d.342
Erythrocyte metallothionein (MT), termed a zinc
trafficking molecule, has been used to distinguish between mild deficiency and positive balance of zinc.327 MT
is important for regulation of zinc and copper metabolism (Figure 3.11) and may protect against toxic metal
effects by binding them until they can be excreted. MT
contains multiple metal-binding sites, so that 1 mole
of MT binds 7 moles of zinc.342 In rat studies, dietary
zinc determines MT concentration by regulating MT
mRNA.342, 351, 352 Monocyte metallothionein mRNA also
responds to zinc supplementation.353 MT also can carry
cadmium, mercury and other toxic elements. In humans, zinc depletion has been shown to decrease MT
by 46%,342 or 68% after only 7 days of a zinc-deficient
diet.354 In young males given varying doses of zinc, erythrocyte MT decreased significantly with the dose of only
3.2 mg zinc/d for 42 days, whereas no decrease was seen
in groups given 7.2 or 15.2 mg zinc/d. During zinc depletion, a diet supplying only 0.55 mg zinc/d for 12 days,
decreased erythrocyte MT.342 This demonstrates that only
when dietary zinc is very low does MT decrease. See the
section “Copper” for further discussion of MT.
Zinc status may be more accurately revealed by RBC
zinc rather than plasma zinc measurement.355, 356 Mononuclear blood cells (MBCs) and erythrocytes containing
zinc dependent proteins make an alternative for determining zinc status. For instance, RBCs contain about
10 times more zinc than plasma due to their content of
carbonic anhydrase and other zinc-containing enzymes.
Additionally, since they remain in the circulation for
110 to 120 days,357 RBC zinc levels reflect long-term
zinc stores.344 Low zinc in red blood cells was seen in
1 of 3 cystic fibrosis patients (n = 51).355 High erythrocyte zinc has been found in cases of cancer metastasis,358
hypertension359 and renal failure.356 High erythrocyte
zinc has been associated with increased hypothyroidism in hospitalized patients, and hyperthyroid patients
have been found to have lower erythrocyte zinc.360, 361
Like RBCs, MBCs have zinc levels that can indicate zinc
status.362 MBCs have considerably faster turn over rates
(~10 days), and therefore exhibit intermediate sensitivity
to changes in zinc nutriture compared with erythrocytes.

Zinc Repletion Dosing

The acetate, gluconate, picolinate and sulfate forms
of zinc are acceptable dietary supplement compounds.
Zinc gluconate has been used at zinc equivalent doses
of 5 mg /d,344 10 mg/d,343 or 50 mg/d353,354 before the
first meal of the day to replete patients while supplying
a diet of zinc-containing foods. Repletion has also been
achieved using elemental zinc (50 mg/d) and self-elected
diet.342 Zinc picolinate is not any better absorbed than
other forms.367 Absorption of zinc can be maximized
by reducing dietary phytate. Dietary modification to
increase intake of zinc-rich foods is, of course, a worthy
effort to improve a patient’s zinc status.
Excess iron or calcium intake can decrease zinc
absorption. Cadmium and copper also compete for the
same carrier protein and can decrease zinc absorption.
Conversely, excessive zinc intake can reduce copper absorption, leading to copper deficiency.33 The RDA ratio
for zinc:copper is about 9:1 for adult men and women.
Zinc in human milk is more bioavailable than in cow’s
milk, presumably due to the greater ease of protein
digestion. Long-term alcoholism can result in decreased
zinc absorption and increased zinc excretion.377
Urinary concentrations of amino acids33 important
for zinc absorption, such as cysteine and histidine, may
be valuable adjunct data when zinc is low or high. Intake of dietary proteins that yield cysteine and methionine, such as beans and peas or eggs, may improve zinc
absorption.367

Measurement of 24-hour urine zinc can be clinically
useful, provided that chronic renal disease, liver cirrhosis,
sickle cell anemia and other conditions known to cause
urinary hyperexcretion of zinc are ruled out.370 After an
oral zinc load, psoriatic patients showed lower plasma
zinc levels at 2 and 4 hours than healthy controls, indicating that the condition produced tissue depletion.371
Urinary excretion of zinc decreases as a result of
zinc deficiency.372 Zinc urinary levels are high in muscle
protein catabolism brought about by starvation or
trauma.330 Some studies show that in zinc depletion,
urinary zinc decreases, and in zinc excess, urinary zinc
is high,342 indicating a renal mechanism in regulating
total-body zinc. Urinary zinc, but not copper, was found
significantly higher in stone formers (n = 30) than in
controls (n = 27).373
Hair zinc has been reported by a number of studies to reflect the dietary zinc intake in both animals
and humans. Low levels of zinc in the hair of children
were shown to correlate with poor growth in the Near
East,374 and to correlate with poor growth, anorexia and
hypogeusia (decreased taste) in the United States.375
When low hair zinc status was used as an impetus to
supplement children with zinc, the children underwent
increased growth velocity after zinc supplementation.
Therefore, growth in children upon zinc supplementation serves as a functional marker of zinc. Low zinc in
hair has also been shown in individuals with a high dietary phytate-zinc molar ratio, a factor known to decrease
zinc absorption.330 Such findings have been corroborated
in zinc-deficient children with Crohn’s disease.376 Acute
zinc deficiency, however, can arrest hair growth, causing
levels to remain in the normal range. Thus, hair zinc may
not be a reliable indicator of zinc status in patients with
periodically deficient zinc intake.374
Because zinc is involved in the delta-6 desaturation of fatty acids, the ratio of a precursor essential fatty
acid (linoleic acid) divided by its delta-6 desaturase
product (i.e., gamma linolenic acid) offers a functional
assessment of zinc adequacy. A high fatty acid LA/GLA
ratio indicates functional need of zinc. Inhibition of
delta-6 desaturase can occur not only from zinc deficiency, but also from excess saturated, monoenoic or
trans-fatty acids. Other cofactors required in desaturation are magnesium, niacin, pyroxidine and vitamin C.
For further discussion of this metabolic marker see
Chapter 5, “Fatty Acids.”
## Copper (Cu)
Adequacy assessment: Copper deficiency: RBC Cu, Serum
ceruloplasmin, elevated urinary HVA:VMA ratio, bone resorption
markers Copper excess: urine
Optimal forms: Aspartate or sulfate salts
Clinical indications of deficiency: Refractory anemia
depigmentation, impaired glucose tolerance, cardiac-related
problems, elevated cholesterol
Food sources: Liver, cashews, black-eyed peas, sunflower seeds
Toxicity sources: copper piping, copper cooking utensils
Protective measures: NAC, antioxidants, tetrathiomolybdate, zinc

The average adult has about 100 mg of total-body
copper (Cu). Copper is required for over 30 metalloproteins involved in oxidation-reduction reactions; neurotransmitter, energy, myelin and bone or connective tissue production; immune function; and hematopoeisis.32,
Cuproenzymes are primarily involved in one-electron
exchanges, frequently utilizing oxygen and ascorbic

acid. As such, cuproenzymes have key roles in antioxidant defense systems, including superoxide dismutase
(SOD), which reduces the free radical superoxide to
hydrogen peroxide and water.379 Similar to iron, copper’s
ability to transfer electrons makes it critical in metabolic
pathways, yet also contributes to its potential toxicity.
Toxicity is kept in check by homeostatic mechanisms,
which include transport, chaperone and storage proteins
such as cuprometallothionein.380

Figure 3.12 — The Copper-Histidine

Tyrosinase Active Site
Tyrosinase is an oxidase enzyme containing six histidine
residues that coordinate two copper ions to generate
the oxygen-binding site. In humans, tyrosinase oxidizes
tyrosine enroute to the formation of the pigment
melanin. Reduced enzyme activity is associated with
hypopigmentation of skin and hair. Genetic mutations of
this enzyme are associated with albinism. Tyrosinase is
widespread in plants and animals, and is responsible for
the browning (oxidation) of certain fruits, such as apples,
and potatoes when exposed to oxygen.

Homeostatic Mechanisms

stasis and copper transport.389 The metabolic fates of
copper and iron are intimately related, and deficiency of
copper or ceruloplasmin results in cellular iron deficiency and, ultimately, anemia.379 This mechanism explains
how elevated zinc, which decreases copper absorption,
can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. The RDA recommends a zinc to copper ratio of about 9:1.
Ceruloplasmin contains six atoms of copper, three
of which provide active binding sights for electron transfer. It is a powerful antioxidant, scavenging hydrogen
peroxide and other reactive oxygen species while inhibiting lipid peroxide and DNA damage wrought by free
copper and iron ions. Ceruloplasmin also oxidizes certain compounds, such as in the conversion of cysteine to
the disulfide cystine.390 Additionally, ceruloplasmin is an
acute-phase reactant protein, and may elevate in inflammatory conditions.391, 392
At least four atoms of copper are required to complete the structure of cytochrome-c oxidase, the final
and rate-limiting electron transport protein in mitochondrial ATP production.393 This cuproprotein might
be considered the most important enzyme in mammals,
since it sits at the final gateway for energy substrate flow,
and its action governs the life cycle of cells via mitochondrial signaling of apoptosis.394
Copper also acts as a modulator of neuronal transmission in central nervous system (CNS) neurons, being
involved in N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor
modulation395 and catecholamine biosynthesis.396, 397

The metal-binding protein metallothionein that
was discussed in the section “Zinc” above is key player
in copper homeostasis, as it binds and stores intracellular copper, minimizing the presence of free copper
ions. Metallothionein is a relatively small protein with
multiple binding sites for elements with different valences and ligand field geometries. The synthesis of MT
is up-regulated in states of excess to sequester cellular
Cu2+ (thereby decreasing copper) and in deficiency to
increase absorption.
Metallothionein is capable of binding multiple elements, including toxic metals.385 It has very high affinity
for cadmium and mercury. Therefore, in copper- or
zinc-deficiency states, an increase in metallothionine
may result in an increased uptake of toxic metals such
as cadmium. Cystine residues in MT must be reduced
by selenoproteins so that MT can bind metals. Thus, in a
selenium-deficient, oxidative environment, elements are
released from metallothionein, which also contributes to
metal toxicity.380-384
Excess copper intake or impairment in homeostatic mechanisms can lead to the presence of increased
free copper ions causing pro-oxidative events such as
the Fenton reaction.386 Copper deficiency on the other
hand also leads to oxidative damage due to insufficient
cuproenzyme activity. Thus, copper levels must be
maintained in quite a narrow range for optimal function.387 Refractory anemia is the most common copper
deficiency presentation, whereas subclinical deficiency
states may be more difficult to diagnose. Copper excess
and deficiency can present with similar symptoms, since
both states contribute to oxidative stress.388 Laboratory
evaluation of copper is essential for proper assessment
of copper status, preferably employing both functional
markers and direct measures.

As a final note on copper physiology, the toxic effects of adriamycin on cell growth are due to the formation of an adriamycin-copper complex that inactivates
mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase.398 The effect is
greatly reduced in vitro by adding glutathione, which
effectively competes for copper.399

While frank copper deficiency is considered to be
rare, its most frequently seen in children, patients on
total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and those with malabsorptive conditions or who are under aggressive, longterm zinc therapy. Menkes disease is a copper deficiency
condition caused by an X-linked recessive genetic defect
in the MNK protein (a P-type ATPase), which causes
copper to be exported across the blood-brain barrier,
gastrointestinal tract and placenta. Presentation is multisystemic, with alterations to hair and skin and involving
CNS, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, hematological
and immunological derangements. Symptoms appear
in the first few months of life, and death may follow in
early childhood.32,400,401
An extensive body of evidence exists for copper deficiency associated with cardiovascular disease: aortic fissures and rupture, arterial foam cells and smooth muscle
migration, cardiac enlargement and rupture, coronary
artery thrombosis, and myocardial infarction.36, 402-405
Mild copper deficiency can also contribute to elevated
cholesterol, impaired glucose tolerance,406 and erythropoietin and iron resistant normocytic anemias, as well as
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy,
defective elastin and bone demineralization.99 A type of
myeloneuropathy resembling that seen in vitamin B12
deficiency, but responding to copper supplementation,
has also been reported.407
Chronic copper exposure via copper piping or
copper cooking utensils can lead to poisoning. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Longterm exposure to elevated copper can result in hepatic
cirrhosis.32, 388 Wilson’s disease, a condition of copper
excess, is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper
metabolism resulting from insufficient copper excretion

Clinical Associations of Copper

via hepatocytes into bile due to a defect in the same
copper-transport enzyme as in menkes, P-type ATPase.
This pathway is the sole mechanism of copper excretion. When it fails, toxic levels of copper accumulate and
produce neurodegenerative conditions and cirrhosis.
Excessive accumulation of copper in the hepatocyte
cytoplasm causes cellular necrosis and leakage of copper
into the plasma. Copper is also deposited in extrahepatic
tissues, including the cornea (Kayser- Fleischer rings)
and the brain. Patients develop retinal degeneration and
CNS extrapyramidal and cerebellar degeneration with
cognitive dysfunction.400, 401 The excess free copper ions
can behave as free radicals, resulting in cancer and heart
disease. Both zinc and molybdenum (as tetrathiomolybdate) are used to decrease elevated copper levels.32, 378, 408
The competition of zinc and molybdenum with copper
for binding sites on proteins is used to treat copper toxicity conditions such as Wilson’s syndrome, cancer and
other inflammatory conditions.408
Children with autism, a condition associated with
increased oxidative stress, frequently have an elevated
serum copper-zinc ratio409 coupled with reduced
ceruloplasmin, pointing to a derangement in copper
homeostasis.410 Elderly patients are more likely to have
inefficient copper homeostatic mechanisms, producing elevated serum free copper,408 which can lead to
increased oxidative stress. Copper excess or deficiency
due to homeostatic derangements have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.345, 411,412 The
pathophysiology of neurodegenerative conditions has
been associated with copper dysregulation, including
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease
and Down’s syndrome, and idiopathic seizure disorder.412,413 Copper-binding drugs such as tetrathiomolybdate, penicillamine, and trientine have been developed
to treat the toxicity of Wilson’s disease, but they tend
to bind or displace the non-essential toxic elements as
well. Copper-binding drugs inhibit angiogenesis, fibrosis
and inflammation and are used to treat conditions such
as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy and heart
disease indicating toxic effects of excess copper and
other toxic metals.414, 415 Since copper is excreted via
bile, compromised gall bladder activity contributes to
toxicity. Bile duct ligation in rats leads to higher totalbody copper.378, 408

Notes:

Refer to Case Illustration 3.6

Assessing Copper Status

Healthy adults in good copper status showed no
change in bone resorption markers when they were
supplemented with additional copper.431 Copper is involved in bone metabolism via lysyl oxidase, an enzyme
that forms the stabilizing cross-links between collagen
strands. Markers of bone loss, including urinary deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline, hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline have been shown to be abnormal in urine and
serum in copper-deficient humans and animals.428-430
Copper deficiency tends to produce lower levels of the
collagen cross-link markers because the cross-links are
formed by copper-dependent enzymes.

Copper Repletion Dosing

Commonly used bioavailable forms of copper include
aspartate or sulfate salts. Dosing range is 2 to 10 mg/d for
adults. Excessive zinc intake with concurrent low copper
intake can induce copper deficiency. The RDA recommendations for zinc and copper are in a ratio of 9:1.

Manganese (Mn)
Adequacy assessment: RBC Mn; BUN, urinary ammonia markers,
arginine/ornithine ratio

The most frequently used biomarkers of copper status are plasma or serum copper and serum ceruloplasmin levels. Levels of these analytes plateau at adequacy,
so toxic concentrations are difficult to establish. A high
serum copper concentration with elevated copper to
ceruloplasmin ratio is indicative of copper excess.388
Without a measure of ceruloplasmin, serum copper may
change independent of dietary intake. Since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant protein, higher levels are
found during periods of inflammation. Ceruloplasmin
synthesis is suppressed with protein inadequacy or corticosteroid excess. Estrogen, however, tends to elevate
ceruloplasmin,345 explaining why females tend to have
higher serum copper levels. In Wilson’s disease, the Ptype ATPase defect causes ceruloplasmin to be lowered,
whereas free copper is elevated.389
RBC copper may be a useful as a marker for copper
deficiency because of the tight relationship with copper-superoxide dismutase (SOD). Most of the copper in
erythrocytes is associated with this enzyme. In most routine clinical situations, RBC copper appears to be closely
associated with liver copper.416 Direct measurement of
SOD in erythrocytes provides meaningful insight into
copper status.388,417
Several studies have reported hair copper as a measure of copper status.418-423 However, two situations can
occur that will produce misleading results: (1) copper
loading diseases, especially Wilson’s disease, will produce results not reflective of total-body copper stores,
since copper is largely sequestered in the liver,424 and (2)
exogenous contamination such as that found in some
hair treatments causes false elevations. Although urinary
copper is occasionally used to assess body status,423 it
is primarily useful for diagnosis of copper toxicity, such
as in Wilson’s disease, where excretion is significantly
elevated.425
The cuproenzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase
converts dopamine to norepinephrine. Homovanillic
acid (HVA) is the main urinary dopamine catabolite,
and vanillmandelic acid (VMA) is a norepinephrine and
epinephrine catabolite that can be measured in urine.
An elevated HVA/VMA ratio (> 4) is an early and sensitive marker for the copper deficiency as seen in Menkes
disease.426 An elevated HVA/VMA ratio has also been
observed in copper deficiency in animal studies.427 This
ratio may prove to be a highly valued indicator of copper
status, though the ratio may be affected by other factors.

Optimal forms: Sulfate, lactate, succinate, gluconate and citrate salts
Clinical indications: Deficiency: increased oxidative activity, Toxicity:
neurotoxicity, including parkinsonism
Food sources: Tea, whole grains, legumes, nuts, green vegetables

The average adult contains 10 to 12 mg total-body
manganese (Mn),32 primarily concentrated in tissues
requiring high energy, including brain, and also found in
liver, pancreas and kidney.432 Manganese is a group VII
transition metal, existing in a number of different oxidation states, but in biological systems, the most prevalent
are +2 and +3. Chemically, manganese is similar to iron,
so an imbalance in one may induce imbalance in the
other. For example, iron deficiency may increase manganese transport, both in the GI and CNS, creating the
potential for a toxic manganese burden.
Manganese is a cofactor for enzymes involved in
metabolism of amino acids, lipids and carbohydrates.
Manganese-dependent enzyme families include oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases
and ligases. Examples of manganese-containing enzymes
are arginase, glutamine synthase and mitochondrial
superoxide dismutase (referred to as SOD2 or MnSOD).
Physiological activities include immune function, regulation of blood sugar and cellular energy, reproduction,

digestion, bone growth, and protection from oxidative
challenge. Manganese with vitamin K supports blood
clotting and hemostasis.432

Change in CNS manganese tissue concentration
may be accompanied by convulsions. Both high and low
blood manganese has been associated with seizure disorders. In one reported case, a 3-year-old child presented
with idiopathic seizure disorder. The only abnormal
findings were elevated blood manganese and encephalopathy on EEG. The patient, who was non-responsive
to antiepileptic medication, deteriorated to status epilepticus. Immediate resolution was attained upon administration of IV Ca-EDTA therapy. Exposure to welding
done by her father over 1 month was the reason for the
child’s manganese burden.433-435
Increased activity in MnSOD with concurrent reduction in cytosolic SOD (which is copper and zinc dependent) was demonstrated in vitro after cellular gamma
ray irradiation exposure, demonstrating that MnSOD
assessment may be a biomarker of radiation sensitivity,
as well as illustrating the import of MnSOD in radiationinduced tissue damage.436
Iron overload disorders such as Friedreich’s ataxia
(FA), sideroblastic anemia (SA) and hemochromatosis
demonstrate reduced activity of MnSOD. Both FA and
SA present with increased iron deposition in mitochondria. FA, a neurodegenerative and myocardial disease,
is caused by decreased expression of the iron-regulating
mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Low frataxin causes
iron overload and manganese depletion, greatly reducing MnSOD activity. In a frataxin-deficient yeast model,
manganese was shown to increase MnSOD, whereas a
MnSOD mimetic showed little effect. These iron-overload conditions require increased antioxidative support as afforded by MnSOD.437-441 Manganese may be
a worthy treatment consideration in such disorders.

Clinical Associations of Manganese

High doses of N-acetylcysteine was shown to induce
formation of manganese superoxide dismutase in vitro,
thereby preserving its activity.442
Women demonstrate increased absorption of
manganese and increased MnSOD activity mediated
by estrogen, which may exert antioxidant effects by
this mechanism. All forms of SOD are down-regulated
in estrogen-deficient mice that also show increased
vascular free radical activity. Progesterone has been
shown to reduce SOD activity, and thus antagonize the
vasoprotection induced by estrogen. These findings may
in part explain why hormone replacement therapy with
estrogen plus progesterone displayed no beneficial effect on cardiovascular event rates in prospective clinical
trials.443-445
Frank manganese deficiency in humans to date has
been studied only by chemically induced manganese
depletion. However, individuals with low manganese
intake have impaired growth, poor bone formation
and skeletal defects, reduced fertility and birth defects,
abnormal glucose tolerance, and altered lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism. Men experimentally placed
on manganese-depleted diets developed a rash on their
torsos, and women consuming < 1 mg manganese/d in
their diet developed altered mood and increased pain
during premenstruation.432
Arginine converts to either ornithine or citrulline, producing urea or nitric oxide (NO), respectively.
Inhibition of arginase reduces conversion of arginine
to ornithine and promotes conversion into citrulline,
thereby increasing NO production (and decreasing urea
production). Because manganese is the cofactor for arginase, lowered plasma manganese correlated with lower
arginase activity and corresponding increased nitric
oxide production in patients with childhood asthma.446
Similarly, manganese deficiency in rats enhances endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of aorta. Arginase
inhibitors are being considered as potential interventions
for increasing nitric oxide.447-449
Toxic effects of inhaled manganese in dust or aerosols have been reported from occupational exposure in
welding or steel alloy production. Toxicity via ingestion,
primarily from water sources, has also been reported.
Total parenteral nutrition is a potential iatrogenic route
of toxic exposure to manganese. Manganese is being
considered as an additive for gasoline, as a lead replacement. Although it has been shown to greatly improve
oil combustion, attention must be given to the potential

Notes:

due to reduction of heavy metal deposition in basal
ganglia was confirmed by MRI. Occupational exposure
to manganese compounds in this case resulted in high
blood and urinary levels of the metal.126
Manganese enters the CNS and is absorbed along
the length of the small intestine through the divalent
metal transporter 1 (Figure 3.8). Maximal GI absorption
is about 3%. Since iron shares the same transporter, increased manganese GI absorption and CNS delivery has
been shown to occur in iron deficiency states, contributing to increased manganese burden.100
Conversely, manganese absorption is decreased in
the presence of iron. Excretion is primarily via bile to
feces, with minimal elimination in urine. Phytates may
inhibit absorption, and reducing dietary manganese and
increasing biliary elimination further decrease manganese in the body.32, 100 Given the similarity manganese
has with iron, it may be that similar counter-ions would
increase GI bioavailability, including sulfate, gluconate
and citrate.
Manganese is rapidly cleared from blood and stored
in liver and other organs.32 In plasma, manganese is
largely bound to gamma-globulin and albumin, with a
small fraction of trivalent manganese bound to the ironcarrying protein, transferrin.432

for increased exposure.450-453 Vegetarianism may increase manganese body burden via increased dietary
consumption and/or iron deficiency-induced increased
manganese absorption. Soy beverages, including infant
formula, have been shown to contain 100-fold greater
amounts of manganese than human milk, and 10-fold
greater amounts than bovine sources. Studies using soybased formulas in primates show increased incidence
of behavioral disorders.432, 454, 455 However, soy is rich in
phytates that inhibit absorption of manganese as well as
other elements. Thus, vegetarians eating large amounts
of soy may, paradoxically, develop manganese deficiency.
Since bile is the main route of manganese elimination,
individuals with liver disease frequently present with
higher levels of manganese, and therefore are at greater
risk of toxicity.32, 456-458
The organ most vulnerable to manganese toxicity
is the brain. Manganese concentrates in areas with high
iron, including the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus
(GP), substantia nigra and subthalamic nuclei.459 The
neurotoxicity of manganese appears to be mediated by
the oxidation of divalent to highly oxidative trivalent
manganese via superoxide, inducing a cascade of oxidative mediators damaging cellular components, primarily
in the mitochondria.459 Chronic, low-level exposure to
manganese has been implicated in neurologic changes,
decreased learning ability in school-aged children, and
increased propensity for violence in adults.452
Frank manganese toxicity, “manganese madness,”
presents similarly to schizophrenia. Symptoms include
compulsive or violent behavior, emotional instability, hallucinations, fatigue and sexual dysfunction.100
Mechanistically, this initial presentation is likely due to
lesions in the GABAergic neurons of the globus pallidus.
As the condition progresses, damage to the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra causes a clinical
presentation similar to parkinsonism, but differentiable
by the presense of dystonia induced by GP lesions. Furthermore, manganese-induced dopaminergic neuronal
oxidation caused general derangements in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including abnormal
serum prolactin, TRH, FSH and LH. Additionally, excess
manganese can inhibit astrocyte glutamate reuptake,
thereby increasing glutamate’s excitotoxic potential, and
its time in the synapse.432, 456, 458–460
Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for EDTA
chelating therapy in a case of occupational parkinsonism
due to manganese exposure. Improved clinical pattern

Assessing Manganese Status
Some review articles have concluded that there is
no reliable index or biomarker for evaluating manganese insufficiency.32 Others have concluded that of the
direct biomarkers used, RBCs are best associated with
long-term levels and are considered to be a good index
of manganese status.461 Manganese is frequently measured in profiles of trace elements in RBCs or whole
blood where low levels are found in manganese-depleted
individuals. A number of studies examining normal or
deficient manganese in a variety of human populations
have relied on erythrocyte measurements.155, 462-464
Such findings may be combined with other functional markers known to appear abnormal when manganese insufficiency is affecting metabolic activity. Altered
plasma concentrations of ammonia and urea are found
in association with decreased hepatic manganese concentration in young growing rats.465 Thus, serum BUN
and sensitive urinary markers of urea cycle activity (see
Chapter 6, “Organic Acids”) may be helpful along with
demonstration of an elevated plasma arginine-ornithine
ratio to achieve an assessment of low manganese effects.

Hair manganese is a valid indicator of toxicity in cases of
manganese excess, but there is controversy over its use
for deficiency states.466,467 Inconsistent results have been
reported from studies using plasma, serum or urine to
evaluate manganese status.32, 468-475
Because of its strong paramagnetic quality and
primary site of toxicity in the CNS, manganese toxic
burden is readily assessed using T1-weighted MRI.
RBC manganese demonstrates a high correlation with
MRI (r = 0.55, p = 0.02) in manganese-exposed workers prior to onset clinical symptoms. Additionally, RBC
manganese was shown to correlate specifically with CNS
globus pallidus burden. RBC and MRI manganese assessment also correlated in liver cirrhosis patients.468-470

residues on thyroglobulin and is responsible for phenoxy­
ester bond formation between the rings of monoiodo-Ltyrosine (MIT) and diiodo-L-tyrosine (DIT) to form T3
and T4 on Tgb. Afterwards, lysozome-mediated hydrolysis liberates the iodinated compounds from Tgb. MIT
and DIT are recycled and T3 and T4 are released into the
bloodstream. Peripheral conversion of T4 to the metabolically active T3, and subsequent breakdown of T3,
requires the selenoproteins476 iodothyronine deiodinases
(D1 and D2).32 Similarly, the deiodinases work inside the
follicular cell to recycle tyrosine and iodine.

Clinical Associations of Iodine

Manganese Repletion Dosing

Optimal forms: Potassium iodide, molecular iodine

Clinical indications of deficiency: Goiter, hypothyroidism,
hyperthyroidism, fibrocystic breast disease

Adequacy assessment: Urinary iodine, TSH, TT4, TT3, FT4, FT3, RT3

Bioavailable forms of managnese include sulfate,
lactate, succinate, gluconate and citrate. Dosing range is
5 to 13 mg/d for adults

## Iodine (I)

Food sources: Seaweed, shellfish, marine fish, iodized salt

Iodine (I) is necessary to make thyroid hormone, a
regulator of energy metabolism that is vital for normal
growth and development, maintenance of body temperature, and brain development. Thyroxine (T4) contains
4 iodine atoms and triiodothyronine (T3) contains 3
iodine atoms, so iodine constitutes 65% and 59% of T4
and T3, respectively.476, 477 Dietary organic iodine (I2) is
converted to iodide (I-) in the gut and absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.478 Iodide is 100% bioavailable. The term “iodine” may be used for the purposes of
this discussion to denote all forms of the element.
Of the 20 to 30 mg total-body normal iodine
content, 8 mg is in the thyroid gland.33 As shown in
Figure 3.13, follicular cells surround the gell-like colloid
in the central lumen where thyroglobulin (Tgb) is synthesized and iodinated. Tgb is synthesized by follicular cell
ribosomes and moves into the lumen (or colloid) of the
follicle. Tgb is oxidized by peroxidases, iodinated, and
coupled before it reenters the follicular cell for hydrolysis
when T4, with lesser amounts of T3, are finally released
into circulation. Thyroperoxidase (TPO) iodinates tyrosyl
Iodine deficiency is a worldwide problem. The major cause of iodine deficiency is inadequate intake due to
low soil concentration, with resulting low concentration
in crops.27 The iodine content of plants grown in iodinedeficient soil may be as low as 10 µg/kg, compared with
1,000 µg/kg for plants grown on soils with high iodine
content.481
Iodine deficiencies are the leading cause of preventable mental retardation worldwide.27 Iodine deficiency is
known to affect all stages of life. For the fetus, it can lead
to abortions, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, increased
perinatal mortality, endemic cretinism and deaf mutism. In the neonate, it can cause goiter, hypothyroidism,
mental retardation and increased susceptibility of the
thyroid gland to nuclear radiation. Neonatal screening
can prevent neurological consequences of congenital
hypothyroidism in infants after birth.477 In children
and adolescents, iodine deficiency can lead to goiter,
subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, impaired mental function, retarded physical
development and susceptibility of the thyroid gland
to nuclear radiation. Finally, in the adult, the consequences of iodine deficiency are goiter, hypothyroidism,
impaired mental function, spontaneous hyperthyroidism in the elderly, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism and
increased vulnerability of the thyroid gland to nuclear
radiation.482-486 Iodine deficiency coupled with high
goitrogen intake for a long time period can bring about
goiter.487,488 The combination of goitrogenic thiocyanides
with selenium deficiency is a risk factor for endemic
myxedematous cretinism.489 For more discussion on
the impact of goitrogens on hormone function see
Chapter 10, “Hormones.”
Iodine is essential not only for proper thyroid function, but it is also needed in mammary tissue. Iodine

can be used therapeutically in mammary dysplasia
and fibrocystic breast disease, presumably due to the
similar uptake and utilization of iodine in thyroid and
mammary tissues.490 In a review of 3 clinical studies
of fibrocystic disease, between 40 and 74% of patients
experienced improvement with oral supplementation of

molecular iodine (I2).491 Molecular iodine has also been
recommended as an adjuvant to breast cancer therapy,
given its suppressive effect on tumors and its role in
controlling mammary gland proliferation.492 In animals,
long-term iodine deficiency increases carcinomas of
thyroid epithelial cells. Population studies have found

Figure 3.13 — Iodine Transport and Thyroid Hormone Synthesis in the Thyroid Follicular Cell
The thyroid gland contains many follicles composed of a central lumen (colloid) surrounded by follicular cells. Iodide
enters the thyroid follicle via the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and moves toward the lumen of the follicle. The pendrin
symporter (P) exports iodide from the cell into the lumen, where it undergoes oxidation by thyroperoxidase (TPO) to
yield iodate (I2-). Thyroglobulin (Tgb), synthesized in the follicular cells via TSH-regulated gene transcription, contains
around 115 tyrosine residues available for iodination when it enters the lumen. Thyroperoxidase adds iodine to tyrosyl
residues, creating MIT and DIT. Intramolecular coupling of MIT and DIT yields protein-bound triiodothyronine (T3) and
tetraiodothyronine (T4 or L-thyroxin). Thyroglobulin bearing MIT and DIT (and residual T3 and T4) undergoes phagocytosis
to re-enter the follicular cell, where it is hydrolyzed, releasing T3, T4, MIT, and DIT. Free T3 and T4 are then exported from
the follicular cell. Free follicular cell MIT and DIT undergo deiodination (selenium dependent), thereby recycling iodine and
tyrosine for further synthesis of thyroid hormone in the follicle.

higher iodine intake associated with lower incidence for
some types of thyroid cancer, that is, fewer aggressive
and more papillary carcinomas.493 Potassium iodine,
given to individuals exposed to radioactive iodine in the
Chernobyl disaster, reduced thyroid cancer.494
Halogens other than iodine have been shown to
impact thyroid function. Bromine can replace iodine in
both T3 and T4, without loss of hormone activity. In
experimental animals, high bromide intake causes decreased iodine in thyroid, skin, and in mammary glands
and increased iodine excretion.495 In low-birth-weight infants exposed to chlorine dioxide by-products, TSH was
significantly higher than those in the reference group.496

Although up to 1,000 µg of iodine daily is considered safe, therapeutic doses of iodine are not agreed
upon, making iodine testing very important in patient
care. Iodine repletion doses range between 6 and 50
mg/d.497 Excessive intake of iodine reduces organic binding of iodine, resulting in hypothyroidism and goiter,494
thyroiditis,498 and autonomous thyroid nodules.499
Excessive iodine intake can also stimulate autoimmune
thyroiditis in animals and humans.478, 500 When the thyroid is damaged, down-regulation of iodine uptake with
excess intake can be dysfunctional. In one study, 15 of
34 infants positive for congenital hypothyroidism were
diagnosed with hyperthyrotropinemia due to overconsumption of iodine (820–3,200 µg/d) by the mothers
during pregnancy.501 Chronic intake of large amounts of
iodine can limit thyroid hormone synthesis and release.
Tolerable upper limits of intake are largely mediated by
the degree of iodine deficiency prior to loading. For instance, in long-term mild iodine deficiency, iodine trapping is more effective than in those with normal intake,
making a sudden high dose potentially detrimental.478
Therefore, supplementation should be gradual. Iodides
are also used to inhibit iodination and proteolysis of Tgb
in thyrotoxicosis.476, 502 These concerns make testing for
iodine essential in proper management of a patient.

Iodine Toxicity

Iodine deficiency is indicated for individuals with UI
concentrations < 50 µg/L.486
Although the United States and Canada were not
previously considered to be at high risk for iodine
deficiency, restricted salt intake from efforts to control
hypertension are changing that opinion. Iodine deficiency in the United States has increased in the last few
decades. Mean urinary iodine (UI) went from near 220
µg/L in the 1970s to 145 µg/L by 1994, and then rose
slightly to 165 µg/L in 2001 and 2002.506 Presumably
due to decreased iodized salt intake, 12% of the US
population had UI below 50 µg/L in one large survey.502,
The highest UI levels have been found in children
when compared to adults, while the lowest iodine levels
have been found in adults age 45 to 59. Men have
higher UI than females overall.508 These differences complicate making conclusions about iodine adequacy from
population data.
Attention to specimen timing is important for UI
determination. In a study of 3,023 spot urines, UI variation displayed circadian rhythm that was independent
of subject, age, gender and season.509 Concentrations
were lowest in the morning, so this specimen may show
falsely low levels when compared with limits from other
time intervals. Sampling casual urine samples from
various times of day, testing over more than one day, and
reporting as µg/mg creatinine (UI/Cr) improves accuracy
of measuring individual iodine status.510
Twenty-four-hour UI is preferred for its reliability
and assessing individual iodine status, especially in conditions where urinary creatinine should be interpreted
with caution (i.e., elderly, malnourished, or with muscle
wasting). Patients must take care in specimen collection
to ensure accurate results.511 More than one 24-hour
UI is ideal. Normal values for 24-hour urine collection
are 100 to 460 µg/d.512 When 15 men were tracked for
a year with multiple sample collections, 24-hour urine
specimens were found to be more accurate than UI/Cr.513
Population studies have used random spot UI concentration measured as µg/L,508,514 however, the concentration
of iodine in a spot urine specimen is influenced by recent iodine intake, so the test may not accurately reflect
an individual’s iodine status.
Although 24-hour UI/creatinine eliminates withinday and day-to-day variations in iodine excretion,
creatinine is affected by poor nutrition, advancing age
and sedentary lifestyle. Large inter- and intraindividual
variations have been reported for creatinine, so the

Assessing Iodine Status
Direct Iodine Measurements: Approximately
10 to 20 µg of iodine are lost daily in the feces, and
100 to 150 µg as urinary iodine (UI) in iodine-sufficient
populations,502 thus excretion is primarily through the
urine,33 and UI is believed to accurately reflect the mean
iodine intake in population studies (see Table 3.7).503-505

TSH and serum thyroglobulin (Tgb) increase in
iodine deficiency.518 However, mild to moderate iodine
deficiency may not be reflected in TSH levels.519-521
Thus, clinically significant iodine deficiency could have
detrimental mental and neurodevelopmental consequences without tell-tale high TSH and without clinical
hypothyroidism. In rats, iodine deficiency resulted in a
variety of adaptive mechanisms to ensure adequate T3
supply to skeletal muscle, heart, lung and ovary, whereas
other tissues, such as the brain, were deprived of T3.521
Due to increasing rates of peripheral conversion, T3
may increase as iodine deficiency worsens, while T4 is
still within normal ranges.345 Other nutrients that affect
peripheral conversion to T3 are covered in Chapter 10,
“Hormones.” Analysis of NHANES data shows no correlation of urinary iodine (µg/L or µg/mg creatinine) with
TSH and T4.522 The combination of UI with TSH and T4
provides improved assessment.
Functional Iodine Tests: The iodine skin test is a
traditional approximation method of checking iodine
status by painting the skin with a solution of iodine

creatinine normalization method may give inaccurate
results for iodine levels,515 misrepresenting iodine
deficiency as iodine sufficiency.483, 516 Testing for iodine
in pregnancy requires special consideration, as UI has
been shown to elevate in pregnancy, and whether it is a
pregnancy-related increase or masked deficiency is yet
unknown.483, 519
Iodine may be measured in elemental profiling of plasma or serum, although the values provide
only a measure of circulating thyroid hormone under
most routine clinical conditions. Normal values are
40 to 92 µg/L.512
Indirect Iodine Measurements: Physical examination of thyroid size by palpitation or measurement by ultrasonography provides clinical evidence of dysfunction
from improper iodine status.486 The late-stage chronic
deficiency effect of palpable goiter is consistently associated with lower urinary iodine, such as when 568 school
children in remote areas of Turkey were examined.517
These procedures are examining end effects; however,
that may not appear for years, during which iodine
insufficiency may be producing clinical effects. Thyroid
hormone and TSH testing has long been used as a kind
of functional assessment of iodine status, although the
levels vary for many reasons other than iodine status.
As iodine becomes the limiting factor for thyroid
hormone production, T3 is increased, at the expense of
T4 in the thyroid gland and in plasma, and longer-term
deficiency will cause a decline in both hormones.477
Thus, a high T3/T4 ratio is consistent with early iodine
deficiency. Primary hypothyroidism, the most common
cause of low thyroid function, refers to a lesion within
the thyroid gland itself. In an iodine-replete individual,
autoimmunity is the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism. See Chapter 10, “Hormones,” for further
discussion of hypothyroidism.

Notes:

containing 76 mg of iodine, they excreted approximately
90% of the iodine in the following 24 hours.911 After 8
days of consuming iodine supplemented table salt, an
average of 92% of the extra daily iodine appeared in 24hour urine from 12 healthy adults.531 Such evidence has
been used to propose a standard test for iodine status in
which 90% of a 50 mg oral iode load is expected to be
recovered as urinary iodide in 24 hours. Recoveries of
less than 90% may indicate poor iodine saturation and
potential benefit from extra iodine intake.532 High retention (low % recovery) may arise due to pregnancy,519 and
goitrogen intake can easily cause false positives because
the iodine fails to be absorbed.

Refer to Case Illustration 3.7

Other Related Tests: Tyrosine and selenium may
warrant testing in thyroid deficiency. Rising TSH in a
patient with low plasma tyrosine may signal thyroid
hormone restriction by substrate availability, especially
in those who have slow conversion of phenylalanine to
tyrosine. See Chapter 4, “Amino Acids,” for discussion
of these amino acid issues, and see Chapter 10, “Hormones,” for further discussion of thyroid hormone.

and observing the time interval for fading of the color.
Rapid fading of the iodine, compared with control, is
understood to indicate a need for iodine.523 There are no
accepted norms for the time for fading, and the observation is complicated by dark skin color.
Measuring thyroglobulin in whole blood or dried
blood spot specimens (BS Tgb) is a promising new
approach.524 Chronic iodine insufficiency results in
increased uptake of Tgb by follicular cells in order to
increase the release of thyroid hormone. The process
also releases portions of intact Tgb into blood that can
be detected by sensitive analytical methods. At birth,
iodine availability determines the degree of Tgb iodination that is reflected by serum Tgb.525 Goitrous patients
have elevated basal serum Tgb levels that normalized
after 30 months of therapy with iodized oil.526, 527 Along
with significantly lowered urinary iodine excretion,
Danish women in late pregnancy were found to have
serum Tgb levels twice those of controls.528 In myxoedematous cretinism with thryroid involution, paradoxically
low serum Tgb and elevated TSH levels were found in
response to iodine treatment, suggesting a low thryroid
reserve and a reduced amount of functional thyroid
tissue.529 In these patients the serum Tgb/TSH ratio has
been proposed as a predictive index of thyroid reserve
and of positive response to iodine administration.529 The
availability of a standard reference material greatly facilitates establishing the absolute accuracy and interlaboratory comparisons for the BS Tgb test. The test is sensitive to iodine status and specific to the thyroid response,
while being uncomplicated by reliance on intestinal
absorption or urinary excretion of iodine.524, 530
Iodine Loading Tests: When 570 mg of iodine was
given to healthy adults as an oral bolus, 24-hour urinary
iodine levels were elevated above baseline for up to 6
months.533 Such observations show that there is a large
capacity for ioding sequestration. If that capacity is unfilled, then higher amounts of iodine are retained. When
healthy, euthyroid males were given 100 mg of oral KI
Notes:
Repletion Dosing of Iodine
Thyroid function should be monitored during
aggressive dosing of iodine. Forms of iodine include
Lugol’s (a mixture of iodine, iodide and potassium
iodide, of which approximately 77% is iodine), Iodorol
(iodine or I2), which is administered in long-acting dextrose capsules or dextrin compound, iodate salts and the
antimicrobicide betadine (1% iodine). T3 and T4 have
also been used in replacement studies.534 A combination
of iodine and iodide is recommended, and therapeutic
doses range from 6 to 50 mg/d. If giving Lugol’s solution, 1 drop has 2.5 mg iodine and 4 mg iodide, whereas
Lugol’s tablets contain 5 mg iodine and 7.5 mg iodide.497
Iodized salt and iodized oil are used for widescale public
health measures against iodine deficiency disorders.535
In hypothyroid children with elevated TSH, oral doses
of iodine (0.1 mL containing 48 mg) were used to regain
euthyroid status.529 Iodized oil as injections have been
employed successfully to improve iodine status better
than oral oil.526, 527 One study showed that oral delivery
of 1 mL of iodized oil containing 480 mg of iodine protected subjects from iodine deficiency for 1 year.536

## Selenium (Se)

thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). The type III
isozyme of ID inactivates thyroid hormones by catalyzing inner ring deiodination of T4 to reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and T3 to 3, 3′-diiodothyronine (T2), both
of which are biologically inactive. Regulation of type III
iodothyronine deiodinase appears to be tissue-specific,
with higher amounts of the isozyme present in brain and
skin of adult humans.541-543
Supplementation with selenium in patients with
autoimmune thyroiditis has been shown to significantly
reduce antibody production and oxidative stress, most
likely through increased GPx and TR activity. Additionally, low serum selenium is associated with increased
risk of thyroid cancer, again likely due to reduced activity of GPx and TR.544, 545

Adequacy assessment: RBC, whole blood, hair or serum selenium,
plasma selenoprotein P, urinary selenosugar

Figure 3.14 — Selenocysteine
Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine with a selenium atom
instead of sulfur in the side chain.

Total-body selenium (Se) is approximately 14 mg.32
Among essential trace elements, selenium occupies a
unique position regarding biochemical and physiological mechanisms. Because of its similar size and bonding
geometries, selenium may replace the sulfur atom in
cysteine, creating a selenocysteine residue. Selenocysteine (Figure 3.14) became the twenty-first amino acid
recognized as part of the universal genetic code.537 In a
series of complex steps taking place in the endoplasmic
reticulum, a selenocysteinyl-tRNA residue is formed
from reaction of selenophosphate with the L-serine
adduct, seryl-tRNA. Selenocysteine inclusion into a
polypeptide is dictated by the mRNA codon, UGA (previously thought to be a nonsense or termination codon).
In selenoproteins, the selenocysteine residue is part
of the polypeptide, with the selenium atom frequently at
the catalytic site. Selenoproteins include the glutathione
peroxidases (GPx), which are involved in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxide,538 and
the thioredoxin reductases (TR) that reduce a variety of
molecules, including ascorbic acid, lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, vitamin K and tumor suppressor protein p53.
Through its ability to reduce ascorbic acid, thioredoxin
reductase regenerates vitamin E.539, 540 Selenocompounds
including TR dictate the redox activity of metallothionein, and are therefore involved in the binding or release
of intercellular zinc, copper or cadmium (see sections
”Zinc” and “Copper” above, and “Cadmium” below). In
a selenium-deficient state, oxidation of metallothionein
may lead to the uncontrolled release of metals, especially
copper and cadmium, thereby contributing to toxicity.382, 384 These events can set up a feed-forward cycle of
further oxidative challenge and metal toxicity.382
Normal functioning of the thyroid gland itself is
dependent on the selenoproteins iodothyronine deiodinase (ID), GPx and TR, demonstrating the interrelated
metabolic roles of selenoproteins. GPx and TR increase
antioxidant activity in the gland. ID converts the thyroid
hormone thyroxin (T4) to the metabolically active

Food sources: Garlic, onions, broccoli, Brazil nuts, brewer’s yeast

Clinical Associations of Selenium
Given the diversity of selenoprotein activities, it
is not surprising that selenium deficiency affects most
physiologic systems, including endocrine and reproductive, hepatic, cardiovascular, immunological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal.538, 546-551 Selenium is
widely recognized as a key nutrient in cancer prevention
and treatment. As selenium intake decreases among
study populations, there is significant increased risk of
colon, prostate, breast, ovary, lung and hematopoetic
cancers.546 A relative cancer risk of 3.1 (95% confidence
interval) was associated with serum selenium levels less
than 45 µg/mL.552 Mechanisms of action show decreased
oxidized cytochromes, increased apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest, decreased angiogenesis, inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa b, and in prostate cancer, selenium modulates
androgen receptor and androgen receptor genes.553, 554
Individuals with elevated body burden of toxic elements
have greater difficulty maintaining sufficient selenium

Selenium is metabolized via methylation and excreted as a number of different compounds, depending
on selenium load. In toxicity states, trimethylselonium
is released in urine, and dimethylselonium is exhaled
from the lungs, producing the garlic odor of selenosis
(Figure 3.15). Selenosugars are produced and excreted
in urine at normal and therapeutic selenium intake.
Selenosugars have gained attention as a way of assessing
selenium repletion in cancer therapy.553, 554, 560, 561

Assessment of Selenium Status

Perhaps more than any other element, selenium
has a narrow therapeutic window. Thus, evaluation of
selenium status is essential for determining need for selenium therapy. Serum T4 elevation with T3 depression
is a functional marker of selenium because the imbalance may be produced by depressed ID activity due to
selenium deficiency.543, 562
Erythrocytes can be useful to establish selenium
status, as selenium is present in high concentrations in
erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase.563-567 However, of
all the selenoproteins, GPx has the lowest threshold for
selenium saturation, thus erythrocyte selenium repletion
may not reflect total-body status.538 In other words, a
patient with normal RBC selenium may still have insufficient selenium to supply other selenoprotein demands.
Blood selenium is found in many forms: 60% as
selenoprotein P (SP), a glycoprotein containing about 10
selenocysteine residues, 20% as erythrocyte glutathione
peroxidase, and 20% bound to albumin.568 SP is the
main selenium protein in the CNS as well as the blood.
It is widely used in research as a marker for establishing
total-body selenium status.547, 569, 570 In selenium-deficient humans, serum GPx normalized more rapidly than
SP, showing SP to be a preferred marker of the totalbody selenium pool.571
In clinical settings, whole-blood selenium is widely
used to assess selenium status.32 Also, large studies evaluating selenium in cancer and other diseases have relied
on plasma and serum levels.554 Whole blood selenium
may be more reflective of long term selenium status than
plasma selenium.572
Urinary selenocompounds can also be useful in
assessing selenium status. Selenometabolites such as
monomethylselenium are excreted in urine as well
as selenosugars, primarily as methylseleno-N-acetylD-galactosamine. As the selenium load increases,
methylation activity increases, causing production of

status. Selenium is able to form seleno-glutathionyl
arsinium ions that are excreted in bile as well as insoluble selenides with both arsenic101, 555 and mercury.556,
Although the formation of such compounds reduces
toxic effects of the heavy metals by sequestering them as
selenocompounds, depletion of the available selenium
pool could lead to selenium deficiency.
Selenium levels in food vary greatly depending
on soil levels. Severe deficiency associated with low
soil selenium was first reported in the Keshan region
of China. Keshan disease is a cardiomyopathy occurring primarily in women and children. Recent evidence
shows Keshan disease is a selenium deficiency associated
with a viral infection. Both influenza and coxsackie virus
B3 demonstrated increased virulence when inoculated
into selenium-deficient mice.9 Similarly, Keshan-Beck
osteoarthropathy, a degenerative joint disease caused by
oxidative damage to cartilage, is associated with severe
selenium deficiency due to soil depletion. The incidence of both conditions decreased with the addition of
supplemental selenium.558
Frank selenium toxicity, called selenosis, is rare in
humans. However, cases have been noted, primarily
caused by contaminated soil. Symptoms of selenosis
include garlic breath odor, thick brittle fingernails, dry
brittle hair, red swollen skin of the hands and feet, and
nervous system abnormalities including numbness,
convulsions or paralysis. High-dose selenium ingestion
or exposure was first recognized in the United States in
South Dakota livestock ingesting “selenium accumulator” plants growing in selenium-rich soil. The rural families that lived in the area tested positive for high urine
and hair levels of selenium.558 Recently, selenosis-like
symptoms were reported to occur in a small trial of men
with prostate cancer taking doses as high as 3,200 µg/d
for 1 year.559
Concern regarding carcinogenicity of certain selenocompounds, particularly selenomethionine, has existed
for years.32 Recent research validates that a number of
selenocompounds are pro-oxidative in vitro, and teratogenicity due to high-dose selenomethionine exposure
has been shown in animal studies.555
Selenium is efficiently absorbed in the GI, primarily
as selenomethionine or selenocysteine, via methionine
or cysteine amino acid active transport. GI absorption
is enhanced in the presence of dietary proteins and
vitamins E and A and inhibited with vitamin C, sulfur,
arsenic and mercury.32

Dietary selenocompounds may be converted to hydrogen selenide which generates selenophosphate for selenoprotein
synthesis. Selenocysteyl-tRNA is incorporated into selenoproteins as dictated by the DNA codon UGA. The hydrogen
selenide pool must be regulated since excess is toxic. Dietary selenomethionine and Se-methylselenocysteine also generate
methyselenol which only slowly enters the hydrogen selenide pool. Methylselenol has been shown to be anticarcinogenic. In
selenium excess, methylselenol is methylated with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to dimethylselenide and trimethylselenonium
that are eliminated in breath and urine, respectively. Hydrogen selenide also generates monomethylated selenosugars that
are eliminated in urine and may serve as markers of selenium status.

Although yeast primarily contains selenomethionine,
garlic, onions and broccoli are rich food sources of
mixed selenocompounds. Of these, garlic contains the
widest variety of selenocompounds, including low-dose
inorganic selenium, in ratios that are safe and effective.
However, selenium content of foods is highly variable,
depending on soil content. Soil supplementation and
organic farming can improve food selenium content.10
Standardization of food extracts is needed.575

Repletion Dosing of Selenium

## Molybdenum (Mo)
Adequacy assessment: Urinary sulfate, uric acid, elevated sulfite,
xanthine, hypoxanthine. Direct assessment—hair
Optimal forms: All are equally well-absorbed

Clinical indications of deficiency: Sulfite intolerance, copper toxicity

Food sources: Beans, nuts, grains, green leafy vegetables

Total-body molybdenum (Mo) content is only about
7 mg,32 meaning that concentration measurements of
molybdenum are in parts per trillion.The word molybdenum comes from the Greek word molybdos, meaning “lead-like.” Molybdenum chemistry is very unique
in that certain molybdoenzymes are able to catalyze
reactions utilizing molecular oxygen from either water,
which is highly unusual, or O2 with hydrogen peroxide
as a reaction by-product. During the stress of transition from ischemia to reperfusion, the molybdoenzyme
xanthine oxidase produces the reactive oxygen species

Selenium supplementation is a complex topic
because ingested selenocompounds can affect selenoprotein formation and enzymatic activity differently, and
can be toxic.573, 574 The most frequently used and best
absorbed form of selenium is selenomethionine. Selenomethionine has been the main form of selenium used
to date in cancer therapy, where it is shown to increase
TR and glutathione-S-transferase activity in vivo.553, 554,
However, it readily replaces the methionine residues
in muscle proteins rather than directly contributing to
other selenoproteins, and accumulation may lead to
selenium toxicity. Certain methylated selenocompounds,
such as Se-methylselenocysteine, have been shown to
be less toxic and are being researched for their chemotherapeutic effect.553 Se-methylselenocysteine activity
is mechanistically different from that of selenoprotein
activity, and it does not significantly enter the selenium
pool that can contribute to selenoprotein status.553, 573
The RDA for selenium is 55 µg/d. Selenoprotein
repletion doses of 60 to 100 µg,571 and cancer prevention or therapy at 200 to 800 µg have been reported.
Although the bulk of cancer research was conducted using selenomethionine, current evidence shows increased
efficacy with lower toxicity using Se-methylselenocysteine and other methylated selenocompounds.553, 554
The forms most often used for supplementation are
selenomethionine and selenocysteine. Optimal selenium
supplementation may include a variety of selenocompounds, including Se-methylselenocysteine, selenocysteine and selenomethionine. Small amounts of inorganic
selenium as selenite or selenate may also be used.550, 573

The molybdopterin (MPT) cofactor contains

above is specific for the sulfite oxidase of hepatic and
intestinal detoxification systems. All MPTs have similar
core structures of a pterin ring bound to a molybdenum
atom. The formation of molybdopterin appears to involve
copper, which occupies the molybdenum site before
being displaced by molybdate (MoO42-). Other cofactors
involved in the creation of molybdopterin include ATP,
magnesium and iron.

oxidative stress is considered part of the pathogenesis
of reperfusion injury. Therefore, adequate presence of
endogenous antioxidant defenses including superoxide
dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase are necessary to minimize injury.32, 200
Molybdenum sits at catalytic sites in a complex
structure called molybdopterin (MPT) (Figure 3.16),
where it acts as a cofactor for enzymes such as xanthine
oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase, sulfite oxidase,
and aldehyde dehydrogenase.576-578 Multiple, potentially
lethal, inborn errors of metabolism are associated with
genetic derangements of MPT.32 Molybdenum also appears likely to be involved in the formation of taurine
from hypotaurine dehydrogenase.579

Assessing Molybdenum Status

Clinical Associations of Molybdenum
Molybdenum supplementation has been shown to
reduce sulfite sensitivity, a condition marked by asthma,
shortness of breath, edema, dermatitis, and possible anaphylaxis by increasing sulfite oxidase activity, in patients
with low blood molybdenum.580-582 Molybdenum has
been shown to prevent copper retention in tissues and
increase urinary copper excretion. This effect is so strong
that copper deficiency has been induced in animals
exposed to excess molybdenum. Tetrathiomolybdate
(TTM) is a powerful copper chelator commonly used in
the treatment of Wilson’s disease.583-585 TTM is also being
explored as an intervention for certain cancers by inhibiting copper-dependent angiogenesis.586 TTM successfully inhibited tumorigenesis in Her2/neu mice genetically
programmed to develop breast cancer.415 TTM has also
been shown to inhibit pulmonary and liver fibrosis and
type 1 diabetes in animal models.587 In special clinical
situations, a molybdenum-induced copper depletion has
therapeutic benefit.
Although molybdenum toxicity and deficiency may
be rare, the fact that both states have been reported
suggests that other less severe cases more commonly
occur.32, 588 Individuals with mild molybdenum cofactor genetic polymorphisms can survive into adulthood,
but with profound disabilities.589 Risk for gout increases
for individuals with very high molybdenum intake.590,
Frank deficiency states are largely relegated to those
on total parenteral nutrition, with symptoms including
mental disturbance and coma.32
About 90% of dietary molybdenum is absorbed in
the stomach and small intestine, apparently by passive

Given the low total-body status of molybdenum,
functional biomarkers may be more effective than
direct measurement of molybdenum status. Biomarkers include decreased urinary levels of sulfate and uric
acid with elevated sulfite, hypoxanthine and xanthine.334
Blood and urine specimens have been used for direct
molybdenum measurement, but they are mainly reflective of intake and have not been adequately evaluated.345, 594 Given the cysteine-rich composition of hair,
and molybdenum’s ability to complex with sulfur, hair
should concentrate molybdenum more effectively than
other tissues. Indeed, a few studies show correlatation
of hair molybdenum with disease conditions, one in
particular demonstrating low molybdenum in patients
with severe motor disabilites on enteral nutrition.595-597
An additional study showed correlation with water and
hair molybdenum levels.177 Supplemental molybdenum
is available chelated to metabolic acids such as picolinate
(50 to 400 µg) and citrate. Ammonium or sodium molybdate are other commonly used forms. However, given
its ready absorption, all forms are likely bioavailable.

## Chromium (Cr)
Adequacy assessment: RBC, whole blood, urine, hair;
Insulin, blood glucose
Optimal forms: Nicotinate, chloride, histidine or picolinate salts
Clinical indications of deficiency: Blood sugar dysregulatory
conditions
Food sources: Whole grains, legumes, nuts, yeast, meats

Unlike most essential elements that have multiple
metabolic functions, the only known role for chromium
(Cr) is in potentiating insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
(Figure 3.17).598 This autoamplification allows chromium to exert broad influence on carbohydrate, lipid
and protein metabolism. Total-body chromium concentration is only about 4 to 6 mg, and decreases with age.
There are small chromium storage pools in the testes,
kidneys and spleen. Trivalent chromium is the only oxidation state required in biological systems.32 Hexavalent
chromium is a well-known carcinogen that is particularly associated with lung tumor induction.599

Clinical Associations of Chromium

from blood.32, 602 Subsequent research demonstrated
that chromium transport and cellular uptake is stimulated by the presence of insulin. Chromium is delivered
to insulin-sensitive cells on the iron-binding transport
protein transferrin.603 In the cytosol, it is theorized that
chromium complexes with apochromodulin, inducing a conformational change, which creates active
chromodulin. Chromodulin is a protein that is rich in
cysteine, glycine, glutamate and aspartate residues and
tightly binds four ions of trivalent chromium. It is also
referred to as low-molecular-weight chromium-binding
substance (LMWCr), and is similar in structure to yeast
glucose tolerance factor (GTF). Chromodulin dramatically increases the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin
receptor, thereby inducing downstream events stimulated by insulin. For example, chromium supplementation

Chromium and insulin work in tandem. When
insulin is released into circulation, chromium transport
to insulin-sensitive cells is increased. Once inside the
cell, chromium acts as an autoamplifier of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. However, chromium is a
nutritional double jeopardy. It is known to be removed
from some carbohydrates during the refinement process,
making it less available during the insulin rise.600, 601 It
has also been demonstrated that increased urinary wasting of chromium occurs in conditions of elevated blood
glucose and insulin.598 Thus, consuming refined carbohydrates exacerbates losses of chromium and induces
insulin resistance.
In the 1950s, rats on a chromium-deficient diet
were found to have reduced ability to remove glucose

Figure 3.17 — Chromodulin at the Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
The rising and falling of blood insulin triggers actions mediated by chromium binding in insulin-sensitive cells. The inactive
insulin receptor contains two α and two β subunits (I). Binding of insulin to the extracellular α subunits induces conformation
changes in the cytosolic surfaces of the β subunits, activating their tyrosine kinase activity (II). The ensuing phosphorylation
cascade activates chromium transport from plasma transferrin, resulting in the transformation of apo-chromodulin to
chromodulin (III). The insulin receptor becomes fully active with chromodulin binding, inducing rapid transport of glucose
and an ensuing fall of blood insulin concentrations. With the dissociation of insulin, the receptor ejects chromodulin (IV), a
portion of which escapes the cell to appear in urine as an end product of the entire signaling cycle.

to excretion. Elevation of glucose and insulin lead to increased excretion of chromium, as chromodulin.598 The
Fe-transport protein, transferrin, appears to maintain
Cr3+ levels in the blood plasma and to transport Cr to
tissues in an insulin-responsive manner.598, 603

Assessing Chromium Status

Total-body chromium is so low that analytical issues
have limited accurate direct measures of the element.598
However, instrumentation advances such as the addition
of the dynamic reaction cell (DRC) filters for inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrographic (ICP-MS) methods
allow accurate detection of chromium in urine, serum
and whole blood. The DRC adaptation removes interfering argon carrier gas atomic species, largely eliminating interferences that have compromised chromium
measurements in the past.423, 613-615
While methodology has improved, chromium levels
in states of insufficiency differ depending on matrix and
physiological conditions, resulting in inconsistencies
that appear to greatly complicate interpretation.345, 598,
616, 617
Erythrocyte chromium has been used to assess
excessive levels of exposure in workers exposed to
chromate.618 When exogenous chromium contamination
is limited, hair continues to be a viable specimen option
for establishing long-term chromium status.619
Given the difficulties with interpretation of direct
chromium concentration measurements, functional
evidence for dysglycemia, such as elevated blood glucose and insulin levels, or an abnormal glucose-insulin
tolerance test can provide a functional assessment of
chromium insufficiency.345 Thus far, the reversal of
symptoms with chromium supplementation is currently
the only generally accepted indicator of chromium
deficiency.598, 616
Since chromium is excreted as the insulin-stimulated metalloprotein chromodulin, urinary chromium
presents a special situation, where levels may provide
a type of functional assessment because of the high
percentage that is excreted in the form of chromodulin.
Further research into the interpretation of fasting and
non-fasting urinary chromium levels is warranted. When
exogenous chromium contamination is limited, hair
continues to be a viable specimen option for establishing
long-term chromium exposure.619 An abnormal glucoseinsulin tolerance test may provide a functional assessment of chromium insufficiency.345

enhanced translocation to the plasma membrane of
glucose transporter 4 protein in insulin-resistant animals.603, 604 Once blood insulin levels drop, the insulin
receptors undergo a conformational change that allows
for the release of chromodulin, which is then apparently
expelled from the cell and eliminated in urine. However,
in cases of insulin resistance, with increased concentration of blood glucose and insulin, there is a paradoxical
urinary wasting of chromium, most likely in the form of
chromodulin.598
Since chromium is integral to insulin signaling, all
insulin-mediated metabolic events improve with identification and correction of chromium insufficiency.605, 606
Chromium-induced improvements have been demonstrated in type 2 diabetes, including improved lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism, reduced blood insulin and
glucose, and reduced body weight.607 Chromium supplementation has shown efficacy with atypical depression,
illustrating a link between blood sugar, insulin and
mood.608 Both gestational and steroid-induced diabetics have demonstrated positive response to chromium
supplementation.598 Chromium use in individuals exhibiting no blood sugar irregularities has no demonstrated
beneficial effect.598, 604
Hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) is 1,000 times more
toxic than trivalent chromium (Cr III). In addition to
its carcinogenicity, topically, hexavalent chromium is an
irritant, causing severe dermatitis. Cr VI is still widely
used in industry, and is present in cigarette smoke, paint
pigment, chrome plating, leather tanning, metal prostheses and copy-machine toner.609 Microflora appear
to participate in the reduction of hexavalent chromium
to trivalent chromium, minimizing the effects of toxic
exposure.610 Contamination of ground water with
hexavalent chromium, and the associated morbidity and
mortality to residents of the area resulted in the largest
settlement paid in a direct action lawsuit in US history
and was the subject of the film Erin Brockovich.611
Jejunal absorption is inversely related to dietary
intake, but is generally quite low, ranging from 0.5 to
2%.601, 612 Similar to iron, chromium absorption is inhibited by phytates and enhanced by ascorbic acid. There
appears to be competition by other elements, including iron, zinc, manganese and vanadium. Excretion is
via both renal and fecal routes.32 Chromium appears
in urine primarily as chromodulin. There is a lag time
between oral ingestion of chromium and appearance in
urine, indicating incorporation into chromodulin prior

Elements of Uncertain
Human Requirement

Chromium Repletion Dosing
Chromium picolinate (200–100 µg) is an effective
supplementation for treating diabetes620, 621 and weight
gain from insulin insensitivity.622 Chromium picolinate
may function similarly to chromodulin.604 The form
derived from yeast called chromium-glucose tolerance
factor (GTF), the glutathione-dinicontinate complex
similar to the chromodulin complex, is not effectively
absorbed.32 The chromium-histidine complex appears to
be highly bioavailable.604

## Cobalt (Co)
Dosage considerations: See B12 in Chapter 2, “Vitamins”
Clinical indications: B12 deficiency or pernicious anemia
Food sources: Internal organs, nuts, yeast extract

Dosage considerations: 12–20 mg/day

Clinical indications: Sterioid hormone modulation, bone health,
prostate cancer

Food sources: Apples, soy, grapes, nuts

Boron (B) is gaining acceptance as an essential nutrient in humans, as it appears to fit the primary criteria
of essentiality. Full recognition is likely forthcoming due
to the discovery of an active boron-sodium co-transporter (NaBC-1) in kidney tubules and salivary gland
acinar cells in mammals. Modest boron supplementation
has been shown to stimulate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK), inducing cell proliferation and growth.
Aggressive boron supplementation has a paradoxical
inhibitory effect on MAPK. MAPK activity has also been
shown to be influenced by the presence or absence of
NaBC-1 transporters, illustrating their regulatory role in
boron homeostasis.629-631

Cobalt (Co) is an essential trace element due to
its well-known role in vitamin B12, hence the name
“cobalamin.” One atom of cobalt is found at the center of the porphyrin-like corrin ring structure of B12.
Vitamin B12 is important in hematopoiesis and thyroid
function.32 The consequences of B12 deficiency are well
known, including central nervous system complaints,
pernicious anemia and potentially fatal macrocytic anemia (see Chapter 2, “Vitamins”).
Animals are unable to incorporate cobalt into the
vitamin, and therefore must eat the preformed vitamin.
Since there is no RDA for cobalt, vitamin B12 status must
serve as a surrogate marker. Intake of 1.5 µg/d of vitamin B12 supplies about 0.06 µg cobalt.32
Ingested cobalt is largely excreted in urine. Gastrointestinal absorption varies from 5 to 45%.623 Factors
such as iron status and the chemical form of cobalt
appear to explain discrepancies reported for dietary absorption rates.624, 625 Toxicity may occur at cobalt intakes
above 300 mg/d, although even therapeutic doses at
29.5 mg/d have been associated with toxicity, including goiter, hypothyroidism and heart failure.626 Use of
cobalt salts in beer was banned because they may have
caused cardiomyopathies.627 Whole-blood cobalt was
detected at approximately 0.17 µg/L in patients awaiting
surgery.628

Boron (B)

The elements in this section may be required for
human function, but they have yet to gain general acceptance as nutritionally essential. A number of different
criteria are used to establish essentiality. The simplest
criteria require that the element be needed for optimal
metabolic functioning, with deficiency resulting in
suboptimal functioning. Accurate measurements of these
compounds is possible with current laboratory instrumentation. In the proper forms, supplementation of
these elements is reported to be of clinical benefit under
various criteria, as discussed below.

Notes:
Clinical Associations of Boron
One US epidemiologic study reported an inverse
correlation between prostate cancer and boron intake.629,
In animal studies, dietary boron supplementation
reduced prostate tumor size and content of the tumor
trophic factor IGF-1. It may be that the mechanism of
IGF-1 reduction occurred via the reduction of prostatespecific antigen that is dramatically reduced by boron
supplementation.633
In human and animal studies, boron has been
shown to increase plasma steroid hormones, particularly 17-beta estradiol and testosterone. In vitamin

can produce stunted growth and impaired steroid hormone production.635 Since boron is rapidly excreted in
the urine, acute toxicity is rare, and doses up to 297 mg
are tolerated.
The selenium deficiency disease known as KashinBek is associated with severe lack of boron (and other
elements such as molybdenum and germanium). Boron
is suspected as an etiologic factor because Kashin-Bek
disease produces a type of degenerative arthritis.644, 645
## Nickel (Ni)
Dosage considerations: < 5 µg/day
Clinical indications: Unknown

Food sources: Foods cooked in stainless steel cookware

Total-body nickel (Ni) is 7 mg. In certain biological
systems, nickel has been shown to occupy the catalytic
site of superoxide dismutase, where it is involved in the
reduction of the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide.647, 648 Nickel is necessary for urease activity, a major
virulence factor of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.649 Considerable evidence exists to demonstrate the
essentiality of this transition metal in animals. Deficiency
of nickel is associated with poor growth and reproductive function, and has been shown to work in a cooperative way with calcium, iron and zinc. However, conclusive evidence that it is essential in humans is lacking.650
A major reason for the difficulty is that nickel’s function
in man is not known. Food content of nickel is limited,
although it can accumulate in foods, particularly those
high in acid that are prepared in stainless steel utensils,
due to the high nickel content of stainless steel. No RDA
has been established, and required amounts are likely
considerably less than 500 µg/kg body weight.650 Average intake in the United States in dietary supplements is
less than 5 µg/d. Nickel competes for GI absorption with
iron,32 and therefore may be regulated by the enterocyte
divalent metal transporter protein. Nickel is transported
in blood primarily bound to albumin, and excreted
primarily in urine.
Chronic exposure to some forms of nickel via
inhalation is carcinogenic. Mucosal tissue irritation
associated with nickel includes asthma, rhinitis and
sinusitis. Dermatitis is also associated with nickel worn
as jewelry.453, 651

Assessment of Boron Status

D-deficient animals, boron supplementation increases
half-life of available vitamin D, thereby minimizing the
onset of vitamin D deficiency symptoms. The putative
mechanism behind both actions is inhibition of microsomal hydroxylation required for steroid hormone and
vitamin D clearance.634
Although boron appears to have a regulatory role in
26 enzymes, including those involved in energy metabolism, none of them require boron as a cofactor.635 Boron
is a metalloid element with similar properties to silicon.
Boron is best known for its role in bone health because
of the effects on steroid hormones mentioned above. Boron markedly reduces urinary calcium and magnesium
loss, as well as increases calcium absorption. In human
studies, when compared with healthy bone, arthritic
bone was associated with almost a 20-fold decrease in
boron content.636–637
Boron toxicity resulted in testicular atrophy, decreased seminal volume, decreased sexual activity and
stunted growth.635, 638 Borax (meaning boron-containing
compounds) and boric acid are well-known antimicrobials, and each has been used in laundry detergent and
medicinals.639

Serum and urine boron measurements have been
employed to establish supplementation efficacy, rates of
excretion and dietary intake.635, 640-643 Hair has been used
to screen for boron deficiency. However, as with any hair
analysis, one must carefully consider external contamination, since many commonly used hygiene products
contain boron, including shampoos.177, 635, 640-645 Due to
the poor understanding of boron biochemistry, and its
lack of involvement as an enzymatic cofactor, functional
markers have not yet been found.

Boron Supplementation
Boron is rapidly absorbed by the gut, likely as
passive diffusion; boron is circulated systemically as
free boric acid. Most is rapidly excreted in the urine. In
mammals, there appears to be a small pool of storage
boron, primarily in heart, spleen and bone. In human
trials, boron has been used at supplementation levels
of 1 to 11.61 mg/d, with 20 mg being the UL. Approximately 3 mg/d is the most commonly used dose. This
level corresponds to the upper range of boron intake in
food.637, 646 Although modest boron intake is generally
associated with improved clinical outcomes, high doses

Assessing Nickel Status

may occur. Lithium toxicity may be life threatening, or
result in persistent cognitive and neurological impairment. Long-term use of lithium carbonate for psychosis
has also been associated with thyroid suppression and
increased alopecia.657 Serum lithium must therefore be
closely monitored.658

Urine and plasma have been used for assessing
nickel exposre, although only acute exposure is revealed because of the rapidity of nickel clearance from
blood.453 Hair nickel has been measured for assessment
of nickel status, and may prove a useful biomarker for
past exposure.272, 652, 653 Hair nickel levels were shown
to be elevated relative to controls in 71 nickel-sensitive
women.627

Assessing Lithium Status
In healthy individuals, RBC lithium is greater than
plasma lithium, with an RBC-plasma ratio of 1:57. However, in patients being treated with supraphysiologic
doses of lithium, plasma levels are greater than in RBCs.
Urine has been used to establish lithium deficiency. Hair
lithium levels have been shown to correlate with totalbody content. Numerous studies have shown that lower
lithium values correlate with increased violent criminality, learning disabilities and heart disease. Students in
high academic standing had greater hair lithium levels
than average.627, 659 Low hair lithium was demonstrated
in young children with autism.619

## Lithium (Li)
Dosage considerations: 400–1000 µg/day
Clinical indications: Psychosis, depression

## Vanadium (V)

Average daily dietary intake of lithium (Li) is 650 to
3,100 µg/d. Lithium stores are highest in the cerebellum,
cerebrum and kidneys. Females generally concentrate 10
to 20% more than males. High-dose (average 900 mg)
lithium carbonate has long been used to treat psychiatric disorders, most notably manic depression. In areas
where water lithium levels are low, a concurrent increase
in suicides, homicides and crime has been noted. Urine
lithium levels showed significant inverse correlation
with neurosis, schizophrenia, all psychiatric admissions
and homicide, in decreasing order of magnitude. One
study showed that 400 µg/d in former drug users caused
an increase in total positive mood scores, whereas the
placebo group showed no consistent change.654 In
lithium-deficient animals, behavioral and reproductive
abnormalities were present. Lithium has been shown to
impact several enzymes, including monoamine oxidase
and tyrosine hydroxylase, as well as some hormones
and vitamins, and has a putative role in modulating
electrolyte distribution. Lithium increases GABA activity
and modulates the serotonin indoleamine pathway, thus
impacting serotonin and melatonin and modulating circadian rhythms. It has also been shown to increase the
anti-inflammatory eicosanoid PGE1. Lithium is important during fetal development, as evidenced by the high
amount present in the embryo.654 Lithium has also been
shown to enhance bone formation and improve bone
mass in mice through stimulation of the Wnt signaling
pathway.655, 656 A provisional limit of safe oral dosing for
lithium of 1,000 µg/d was proposed by Schrauzer.654
At the supraphysiologic doses used to treat psychosis, lithium has a narrow therapeutic range, and toxicity

Food sources: Vegetables, grains
Dosage considerations: 9 µg–125 mg
Clinical indications of deficiency: Insulin insensitivity, abnormal
blood lipids
Food sources: Buckwheat, parsley, soybeans, safflower oil

Approximately 2%, or 5 to 10 µg/d of dietary vanadium (V) is absorbed in the small intestine.32 Absorbed
free vanadium is rapidly excreted in the urine. Ironbinding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin may
bind vanadium,32 and other cellular binding sites are
likely in the organs where vanadium is found: kidneys,
bone, liver, spleen and bone.135, 660 Neither RDA nor AI
(adequate intake) has been established for vanadium
because little is known about its role in human biochemistry. However, supplementation of vanadium has
ranged from 9 µg in multielement formulas to 125 mg/d
as vanadyl sulfate in diabetic patients.32

Clinical Associations of Vanadium
Vanadium deficiency has not been established in
humans, but in animals it can lead to increased abortion,
diminished lactation, poor growth, thyroid changes and
changes in hepatic lipid profiles.661 Some studies suggest vanadium has a role in glucose and lipid metabolism, red blood cell formation and thyroid function.135

## Strontium (Sr)

Vanadium assessment and treatment may be indicated in
cases of metabolic syndrome or non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) due to its role in insulin sensitization.662 Vanadium has been suggested to alter blood
lipids in patients with high cholesterol.135Symptoms that
appear to be associated with excessive vanadium are
hypertension, decreased coenzymes A and Q10, bipolar
disorder,663 and disruption of energy metabolism.135
Exposure to vanadium in air or water is of concern for
those working in or living near vanadium plants, and
symptoms may include respiratory disorders,664 green
tongue, high urinary excretion of vanadium,665 and
reduced neurobehavioral abilities.666
Optimal forms of vanadium include sodium metavanadate662 and vanadyl sulfate.32

Dosage considerations: 125–680 mg
Clinical indications of deficiency: Osteopenia, osteoporosis
Food sources: Green leafy vegetables, brazil nuts

Total-body strontium (Sr) is about 320 mg, with
98% residing in bone. Daily dietary intake is about 1 to
5 mg. Strontium possesses a larger atomic mass than calcium, although the elements exhibit similar properties.

Clinical Associations of Strontium

Assessment of Vanadium Status
Vanadium is difficult to accurately measure due to
its low concentration and poor reference materials.667
Urine vanadium is traditionally used to assess occupational work exposure.664, 668 An upper limit of 0.5 µg/L
has been proposed for urinary vanadium.667 Wholeblood vanadium has been shown to significantly differentiate children with vanadium exposure (median 0.078
µg/L) from non-exposed children (median 0.042 µg/L),
but authors stated that hair levels of vanadium did not
significantly correlate with vanadium exposure.669 This
may have to do with distinction of acute versus chronic
exposure. Estimated normal values for blood and serum
vanadium are 1 nmol/L.667

Strontium incorporates into hydroxyl crystal lattice
of bone, stimulates new cortical and cancellous bone
formation, and decreases bone resorption by inhibiting
osteoclastic activity. These effects are shown to occur
during strontium supplementation only and decrease
after the cessation of therapy.670-672 The efficacy of strontium supplementation for improving bone status and reducing fracture risk in osteoporotic individuals has been
demonstrated in many well-designed human and animal
trials670-681 using the synthetic chelate strontium ranelate.
Animal studies using low-dose strontium demonstrated
increased bone formation and volume, without adverse
effects on bone matrix.676 Although a detailed discussion extends beyond the scope of this text, Table 3.8
summarizes efficacy of strontium therapy as compared
with common pharmaceutical interventions, including
calcitonin, bisphosphonate, PTH and hormone replacement therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) and

of type I collagen may be used to establish reduction
in bone resorption due to strontium therapy.672,679, 690
Interpretation of DEXA results must allow for the false
attenuation of strontium.

Strontium Toxicity

There are a number of stable isotopes of strontium,
including 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr and 88Sr. Radioactive strontium,
Sr, is a nuclear waste product and a human carcinogen.
Cancer incidence (primarily bone and bone marrow)
in children under age 10 years living near New York
and New Jersey nuclear plants showed there is a short
latency period between radiation exposure and cancer
onset.684 Strontium has also been shown to impact reproduction in animal studies. The half-life of strontium-90
is 29 years, during which it constantly emits potentially
damaging radiation. During the decay process, strontium
emits beta particles to become radioactive yttrium-90
that continues to emit radiation.609

Assessment of Strontium Status
Serum strontium levels have been evaluated during
therapy to establish GI absorption.670 Urinary calcium
and serum vitamin D can be used to monitor effects
on these nutrients. Hair strontium is commonly measured, although there is little evidence linking it to bone
levels.685-688 Strontium has been shown to concentrate
in hair with increased environmental exposure.689 Bone
resorption tests such as deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline,
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase or C-telopeptide
Toxic Elements

fracture occurance.670-681 There are many nutrients associated with improved bone density, including a number
of elements discussed in this chapter, such as calcium,
magnesium, copper, boron and possibly lithium. Further
discussions can also be found in Chapter 2, “Vitamins”
and Chapter 4, “Amino Acids.”

A few caveats regarding strontium therapy should be considered. Strontium competes with calcium for GI
absorbtion.677 Vitamin D will initially improve strontium absorption,678 but high-dose strontium inhibits vitamin
D formation and induces depletion of the vitamin D pool in animal studies.682, 683 Therefore, human studies
routinely add vitamin D and calcium to control and treatment groups. Whereas recent research has been focused
on strontium ranelate, earlier research on natural strontium salts also demonstrated efficacy, including strontium
gluconate, chloride, citrate, lactate and carbonate.673 All forms of strontium have bioavailabilities in the 25 to
30% range, but gastric tolerance appears to be better with the ranelate and citrate forms.673
High doses or long-term therapy with strontium salts has definite risk of inducing nutrient depletions, as
well as the potential for weakening the bone strength. Another caveat is that strontium will falsely attenuate bone
mineral density when dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan is used to evaluate BMD during strontium therapy.
Other assessment tools, including calcium and vitamin D assessment and bone resorption markers, should be
concurrently employed.

Although the toxic elements, including cadmium
(Cd), arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg), have
always been present in the crust of the earth, their use
by humans has resulted in exposure levels above those
compatible with optimal biological function. Specifically, industrialization over the past 200 years has
increased emissions of toxic elements much greater than
from natural sources. Due to the mobilization into the
biosphere, human exposure to toxic metals in soil, air
and water has increased. Entry into the food chain via
accumulation by crop plants and fish are also common
pathways for exposure.691, 692 Other sources of exposure
include medically approved mercury amalgams and
the mercury-containing medicines such as the vaccine
preservative Thimerosal.693
Although much has been done to successfully
reduce lead exposure, recent research has demonstrated
that blood lead levels much lower than the current CDC
acceptable level of 10 µg/dL are associated with toxicity.694 Cumulative effects from co-exposure to multiple
toxic metals can amplify toxicity, such as the increased
renal dysfunction produced by combined exposure to
arsenic and cadmium, or the increased CNS deficits in
the presence of lead and arsenic.556, 695,696

Essential element deficiencies can exacerbate toxic
exposures through numerous mechanisms. Not only
may the toxic metals be more readily absorbed via the
essential element transport proteins (present in the
gastrointestinal tract and CNS)—which are generally
increased in numbers during deficiency states—enzymes
that lack essential element cofactors are more vulnerable
to toxic interference as well.98 Essential element protection against toxic element effects, such as selenium’s
ability to bind and inhibit the toxicity of both mercury
and arsenic, is reduced in deficiency states.101, 556

An important difference between toxic organic
compounds and toxic metals is that although organic
compounds can be chemically destroyed by exposure
to heat, UV light, or chemical or microbiological attack, toxic metals are virtually indestructible. The only
recourse for the disposal of environmental toxic metals
is to bind them to ligands that alter their toxicologic
and environmental behavior, sequestering them from
re-entry into the environment. In the human body, a
similar, poignant point is that toxic metals tend to accumulate undetected in the body over time. The insidious rise in biological levels or body burdens of toxic
metals eventually threaten normal body processes, and,
in many individuals, become a clinically relevant issue.
Stressful episodes can become triggers that bring latent
toxic metabolic inhibitions or destructive challenges into
active symptoms.
The toxicity of an element depends on its physiochemical properties. Those properties that increase
the absorption and transport of a toxic metal (i.e., its
bioavailability) will determine its ability to reach one
or more target sites within the body. Targets include
sites such as membrane or structural proteins, enzymes,
membrane lipids or DNA. Once at the target site in
sufficient concentration, the metal may substitute for or
otherwise displace an essential element from its binding
site. This substitution is called “molecular mimicry.”697
Yet, because it does not share the exact same chemical properties of the displaced mineral, the toxic metal
fails to substitute for its function. A more sophisticated
discussion of this “foreign-coin-jams-the-juke-box” paradigm is beyond the scope of this book. Nonetheless, it
provides a conceptual framework for understanding an
important underlying mechanism for metal toxicity.

General Mechanisms
of Metal Toxicity

Three other mechanisms of toxicity deserve special
attention, particularly in the context of metals as neurotoxins: (1) inorganic metal transformation to an organic
species, (2) sulfhydryl group binding, and (3) free
radical generation. The first mechanism determines the
abililty of a toxic metal to penetrate compartments in the
body and is an important factor in determining bioavailability. Biological systems have the ability to add methyl
groups to metals, which serves to make the metals more
soluble in lipid environments. A lipid-soluble metal
is many times more neurotoxic than aqueous forms
because it can penetrate lipid membranes and concentrate in lipid-rich tissue such as the brain. The second
mechanism revolves around structure-function changes
that occur separately from molecular mimicry. Many
toxic metals (in particular, lead, mercury and arsenic)
avidly form covalent bonds with the sulfhydryl groups
of cysteine amino acids belonging to proteins. The formation of such complexes can lead to structural changes
to the detriment of the protein’s function. The third
mechanism, free radical generation, involves the formation of highly reactive oxygen species having unpaired
electrons. Unchecked formation of free radicals leads to
lipid peroxidation, cellular membrane degeneration and
ultimately to cell death (see Chapter 8, “Toxicants and
Detoxfication”). Many metals are potent catalysts of free
radical reactions. Though cells have evolved defensive
mechanisms to guard against free radical formation or
to repair the damage caused by them, metals present
in sufficient concentrations will promote formation of
enough free radicals to saturate these defenses.

Notes:

Common sources: Aluminum cookware, antacids, tobacco and

After oxygen and silicon, aluminum (Al) is the most
abundant element in the crust of the earth. Exposure to
aluminum is ubiquitous via food, water, air and soil,698
and aluminum is used to produce beverage cans, cooking pots, siding, roofing, aluminum foil and airplanes.
Further, it is found in antacids,699 buffered aspirin, food
additives (especially in grains and cheeses),700 astringents, vaccinations,698 cat litter, antiperspirants, infant
formula and baking soda. Aluminum has been detected
in calcium, magnesium, and phosphate salts used in
parenteral solutions,701 and it has been found high in
lung tissue as a result of tobacco and cannabis smoke inhalation.702 When aluminum is used in water treatment
facilities, concentration in community water supplies
can reach 93 µmol/L (2,500 µg/L).703
Aluminum is absorbed in the acidic environment
of the stomach and in regions of the proximal section of
the intestine.704 It is said that 95% of aluminum binds
serum proteins, 70 to 90% of which binds transferrin.295,704 Biliary excretion is normally the major pathway
of aluminum elimination.
Aluminum absorption and its toxic effects can
be mediated by diet and by other elements. Common
dietary acids (such as citrate and malate) can increase
aluminum absorption,699 especially in the brain705 and
bone.705 People with low calcium can have increased
aluminum absorption, and calcium has been recommended to reduce aluminum exposure in post-menopausal women.706 Urinary and plasma aluminum levels
were found to increase significantly during supplementation with calcium citrate, apparently due to enhanced
aluminum absorption.707 Calcium deficiency in rats
made them more vulnerable to aluminum transportation
to the neurons and to aluminum neurotoxicity.708
Although trace levels of aluminum may not be of
concern for most adults, aluminum exposure during
infancy and adolescence is a different matter because of

One of the first actions to consider when treating
the toxic metal-exposed patient is to reduce exposure.
Table 3.9 lists common sources of exposure beyond
the obvious ones of living or working near industries
where the metals are mined or processed. The clinician
quick-reference table at the top of each section provides
further assessment tools, including toxicity symptoms,
body burden assessment, protective measures, suggested
chelating agents and specific sources of exposures.2
Each section on toxic or potentially toxic metals
includes a discussion on direct and functional markers
for assessment of body burden. (The section “Element
Status Assessment” at the beginning of this chapter is
relevant to specimen choices for toxic element testing.) As with the essential elements, more than one
assessment tool may be required to gauge both degree
and impact of the toxic metal burden. For instance, as
discussed in Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification,”
porphyrin abnormalities can establish whether a toxic
element functional impairment is present, whereas measuring direct elemental concentrations in body fluids can
identify which toxicant is present.

its tendency to accumulate over time. Compared with
breast milk, cow’s milk and some infant formulas have
2- to 3-fold and up to 10-fold higher levels of aluminum, respectively.709 Aluminum in vaccines may be a
significant source of aluminum exposure in infants.710
Ingestion of aluminum from water and food sources
is typically 5 to 10 mg/d for adults.700 This amount of
aluminum far exceeds the safety dose of lead, mercury,
cadmium and arsenic. Although many people tolerate aluminum well, aluminum in high doses can cause
health problems for susceptible individuals.

The major tissue sites of aluminum toxicity are the
nervous system, immune system, bone, liver, and red
blood cells, and aluminum may interfere with heme
(porphyrin) synthesis.711 The greatest information on
human aluminum toxicity comes from patients undergoing dialysis or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Dialysis
treatments for patients with kidney failure have led to
intoxication due to aluminum-contaminated dialysis
fluids,712 and children treated with phosphate binders
have developed aluminum intoxication.713
Consequences of aluminum toxicity are encephalopathy701 and abnormal speech, myoclonic jerks,
convulsions, and a predisposition to osteomalacic
fractures. Aluminum interferes with enzymatic activity measured in blood, liver and kidney.714 Aluminum
toxicity is accompanied by anemia. Aluminum overload
in dialysis patients caused microcytic anemia715 and
decreased serum ferritin and hemoglobin.716 Interference
in the porphyrin pathway enzymes is indicated by the
development of porphyria cutanea tarda in hemodialysis
patients.717 Dermatitis after vaccinations has been attributed to aluminum-containing vaccines.
Occupational exposure to aluminum(III) increases
the characteristic neurofibrillary formation leading to
Parkinson’s disease.718 Increased exposure levels also
have strong etiological implications for neurological
disorders, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. Although it
is not proven that aluminum is the causative agent,719 it
is striking that aluminum acculates in the neurofibrillary tangles of neurons that characterize the brains of
Alzheimer’s patients (as well as in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson’s and Huntington’s
diseases).720 In vitro studies show that exposure of neurons to aluminum causes apoptosis721,722 and disruption
of mitochondrial transport to the synapse in neurons.723

Clinical Associations of Aluminum Toxicity

High blood levels of aluminum in individuals without
renal disease were associated with hypertension when
compared with controls.724 In patients with multiple
sclerosis, urinary aluminum levels were found to be as
high as if the patients were aluminum toxic and undergoing chelation.725
Aluminum exposure affects catecholamine metabolism and behavior. In a study of 33 workers exposed to
aluminum and 40 controls, urinary aluminum was significantly higher (12.2 µg/L) than controls (5.78 µg/L),
whereas serum aluminum was unchanged. The group
with aluminum exposure had higher vanilmandelic and
homovanillic acids in urine (see Chapter 6, “Organic
Acids”) and were significantly different from controls on
neurobehavioral tests.726 Aluminum administered to rats
with diets low in copper, zinc or iron decreased brain
levels of catecholamines.727
Aluminum replaces calcium in bone, disrupting normal osteoid formation and mineralization. In
hyperaluminemic individuals (serum ≥ 5 µmol/L or
135 µg/L), 67% had either osteomalacia or aplastic
bone lesions, and a subgroup (n = 21) of the individuals
with high aluminum had significantly increased bone
resorption and decreased bone formation.728 Aluminum
interrupts calcium exchange, preventing renal resorption of calcium. Aluminum effectively interferes with
the normal physiologic control of parathyroid hormone,
and therefore may impact the conversion of vitamin D
to its active form.729, 730 Dialyzed or TPN patients have
decreased serum calcitriol. After aluminum removal, calcitriol concentrations returned to normal.731 Aluminum
may also lead to hypercalciuria and osteopenic bone
disease in premature infants on TPN.701
Aluminum intake may negatively affect intestinal
microbiota. Horses consuming high aluminum forage
can develop histological similarities to Crohn’s disease,
leading to a fatal granulomatous enteritis, suggesting
that exposure of intestinal bacteria to aluminum may
lead to increased pathogenicity.732
Status of other elements appears to affect the
vulnerability to neurotoxic effects of aluminum. Iron
deficiency predisposes laboratory animals to higher aluminum absorption and, conversely, aluminum decreases
absorption and uptake of iron. Administration of aluminum alone produces increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrins and decreased iron concentrations in RBC,
spleen and blood. When iron was given with aluminum,
serum aluminum decreased.704 In pregnant rats fed oral

aluminum, urinary aluminum, manganese and copper
were higher than controls. Aluminum concentration was
found high in the liver and kidney and distribution of
essential minerals, in tissues such as bone, brain, liver
and kidney, were altered in aluminum-treated rats.6
Therefore, assessing copper, zinc and iron status helps
to determine a patient’s vulnerability to the toxic effects
of aluminum, and appropriate elemental treatments may
help to overcome aluminum toxicity.733

injections into rabbits showed a dose-dependent relationship with hair aluminum concentration.747
Urinary aluminum can provide information about
aluminum intake and has been used to monitor humans exposed to dangerous amounts of aluminum.748-750
Aluminum is also eliminated by the fecal route. The
porphyrin enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase
was unaltered in aluminum-exposed workers, but other
effects on the pathway were manifest as elevated total
porphyrins in urine.751, 752

Assessing Aluminum Body Burden
Management of the Aluminum-Toxic Patient

Desferrioxamine (DFO) is a chelator of aluminum
and iron that has been used to treat acute aluminum
toxicity. In fact, cases of aluminum toxicity are managed similarly to iron toxicity.2 DFO decreased RBC and
plasma aluminum and improved hemoglobin, hematocrit and mean cell volume in 13 patients.715 Chelation
treatment with desferrioxamine should be handled
conservatively due to the risk of inadvertently mobilizing large amounts of aluminum to the brain, which may
enhance encephalopathy or a chemical interaction.295
The chelator, L1 (1,2-dimethyl-1,3-hydroxypyrid-4one, deferiprone or DMHP) is also used to safely lower
aluminum total-body burden.2, 753 Ascorbate combined
with DFO has been used to remove aluminum from
human brain cells.754 As discussed above, it is important
to assure adequate status of essential elements (calcium,
iron, copper, zinc). Silicon is an antagonist of aluminum.725 Further testing of an aluminum-toxic patient
might involve measurement of bone resorption, urinary
catecholamines, oxidative stress, and even vitamin D.

Because of the ubiquitous nature of aluminum on
particles suspended in air, specimen contamination must
be avoided by collecting and processing specimens with
great care. Special evacuated blood collection tubes are
required for testing aluminum in blood. Blood collected
in the standard evacuated blood tubes may be contaminated by as much as 0.5 µg of aluminum from rubber
stoppers containing aluminum silicate.
Problems with measuring erythrocyte aluminum include insuring an aluminum-free anticoagulant.715 Erythrocyte aluminum has been measured,715, 734 but serum
aluminum levels above 5 µmol/L (135 µg/L) are predictive of aluminum toxicity.735-737 In animals, 2 weeks of
100 mg/kg aluminum chloride administration did not
affect serum aluminum levels.704 Symptoms of anemia
in dialyzed patients were found with serum aluminum
levels over 60 µg/L prior to skeletal and neurological
dysfunction.738-740
One study of dialysis patients and controls showed
that RBC aluminum correlated with plasma aluminum.
RBC and plasma aluminum were inversely correlated
with mean red cell volume.715 However, other authors
have shown that high plasma aluminum precedes
erythrocyte elevations.741 Testing for anemia is indicated
in patients with high RBC, plasma or serum aluminum.
Higher plasma aluminum is seen in infants fed soy formula compared with breast-fed infants.742
Whole-blood aluminum has been used to evaluate
aluminum levels,743 and one study showed that serum
and blood were comparable. Whole-blood concentrations of controls were 12.1 µg/L, and 79 µg/L in dialysis
patients.744 Very high aluminum levels corresponded
in some patients to dialysis encephalopathy and/or
osteodystrophy.745
Hemodialyzed patients (n = 39) were found
to have hair aluminum of 226 nmol/g, compared
with 126 nmol/g for controls (n = 49).746 Aluminum

Notes:

Arsenic (As)

acid status (especially methionine) potentiates arsenicinduced cytotoxicity.762
Arsenic has been linked to increased risk of cancers
of the skin, lung, bladder, liver, kidney and prostate.
Oxidative damage induced by arsenic has been postulated to be a cause of carcinogenesis. In 28 patients
with arsenic-induced skin neoplasm, 78% had significantly higher oxidative damage to DNA, measured by
urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) when
compared with 11 controls.763 There was a significant relationship between urinary arsenic species and 8OHdG
in 134 people chronically exposed to well water high in
arsenic (see Chapter 9 “Oxidant Stress and Aging”).757
Arsenic was shown to be a major cause of blackfoot
disease and apparently antagonizes selenium and iron
as the disease progresses.764 In a study of apolipoprotein
E-deficient mice fed drinking water with 20 to 100 µg
arsenic/mL, the intimal area of the aorta had lesions, and
interleukin-8 was one of many inflammatory mediators
whose gene expression was upregulated.765

Toxicity symptoms: Peripheral arteriosclerosis (“blackfoot disease”)
“rice-water” stools, proteinuria, hyperkeratosis, “milk and roses”
hyperpigmentation, garlic breath odor, stomatitis
Body burden assessment: Urine, hair and nails, whole blood, urinary
porphyrins
Protective measures: Selenium, Emblica officinalis, sulfur amino
acids, glutathione
Chelating agents: DMSA, DMPS, DMPA

Assessing Arsenic Body Burden

Urinary arsenic is most commonly measured to
screen for arsenic exposure because levels reflect intake
from all sources.766 Urine reflects arsenic exposure in
the few days prior to specimen collection.698 Urinary
inorganic (toxic) arsenic peaks at about 10 hours and
returns to normal 20 to 30 hours after ingestion. Nontoxic organic arsenic is completely excreted in 24 to 48
hours after ingestion. Patients should abstain from eating
seafood for 48 hours prior to testing because of the high
content of non-toxic organoarsines in most seafood.
If unsure, the clinician should rule out ingestion of
seafood in cases of borderline or moderate arsenic elevation before implementing aggressive therapy. Specialized
laboratory methods of separation are required to differentiate non-toxic organic forms from the toxic inorganic
forms of arsenic.767
Increased urinary arsenic levels were found in
children living near copper smelters or due to arsenic in
drinking water.768, 769 Steel workers showed significantly
higher urinary arsenic (and mercury and selenium) than
unexposed controls.770 Compared with controls, urinary
arsenic was higher in children living with elevated water
and dust levels (4.75 µg/100 mL vs. 1.17 µg/100 mL).
High urinary arsenic correlated with tap water intake (as
opposed to bottled water intake) and with distance from
the copper smelter.769

Arsenic (As), infamous for its use in homicide by
poisoning, exists in toxic and non-toxic forms. The
toxic forms are the inorganic species of arsenic, As-III
and As-V. Preserved “pressure-treated” wood contains
appreciable amounts of the toxic forms of arsenic, as
do many insecticides. The organoarsines arsenobetaine and arsenocholine are non-toxic forms of arsenic
that are present in many foods, especially shellfish and
other predators such as cod and haddock in the seafood
chain. The EPA has set limits on arsenic levels in drinking water to 0.01 parts per million, whereas industrial
exposure to workers is limited to 10 µg arsenic per cubic
meter of air for an 8-hour work day.
Arsenic expresses its toxicity by: (1) binding with
sulfhydryl groups, which causes distortion of protein
structure and loss of enzyme activity; (2) tightly binding dihydrolipoic acid, a necessary cofactor for keto acid
dehydrogenases; and (3) competing with phosphate
for binding to ATP during its mitochondrial synthesis,
decreasing phosphorylation of ADP.

Common sources: Metal foundry, drinking water, seafood, glues,
industrial exposure, contaminated wine, contaminated herbal
supplements, cigarette smoke, arsenic-treated wood

Clinical Associations of Arsenic Toxicity

Lethal arsenic poisoning is characterized by toxic
hepatitis and pancreatitis, neurological dysfunction,
respiratory difficulty, renal failure and cardiovascular
disturbance.755 Exposure to arsenic-laden drinking water
can induce symptoms of gastroenteritis and lead to cancer, diabetes,756 and neurological and vascular dysfunction. Arsenic can cause skin neoplasm and dermatosis.757
On the other hand, it has been proposed that too little
arsenic is problematic; it depresses growth and interrupts normal reproduction in animals.32, 758, 759
Arsenic binds sulfhydryl groups and its oxidative
effects deplete intracellular glutathione and may disrupt
other sulfhydryl-containing enzymes and proteins.760
Cysteine, glutathione and metallothionein are protective
against arsenic exposure,761 whereas low sulfur amino

administered either orally or intravenously. However,
intravenous DMPS can be quite toxic to the kidneys.
Dimercaprol (BAL) appears to be useful in acute poisoning cases, but has been criticized for its low therapeutic
index, painful administration, odor and redistribution
of arsenic to brain and testes. DMSA and DMPS, on the
other hand, are better for chronic arsenic poisoning.783
d-Penicillamine (DPA) is also used in arsenic chelation, whereas N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and monoisoamyl
DMSA (Mi-ADMS) are still in experimental stages.2
N-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl)phthalamidic acid (DMPA) is
reported to be effective.784 In acute arsenic poisoning,
intravenous and intraperitoneal DMSA (10–20 mg/kg/d)
has been used as well as venovenous hemofiltration, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.755 In a patient who attempted suicide by consuming ~600 mg arsenic trioxide,
DMPS treatment resulted in the first urine void containing 215 mg/L, which decreased 1,000-fold after 8 days
of treatment, at which time the patient was released.785
Crude extract of Emblica officinalis decreased arsenic-induced cell damage in mice,786 and oral supplementation of Centella asiatica (300 mg/kg/d) during
exposure reduced some toxic effects of arsenic in rats.781
Selenium can bind arsenic and render it non-toxic;
however, selenium deficiency can occur in those cases,
as described in the section “Selenium” above.
Arsenic is partially detoxified by methylation to
mono- and dimethylarsine. Folate deficiency coupled
with high arsenic exposure can decrease methylation of
arsenic, resulting in greater risk of cancer and peripheral
vascular disease. Folate administration to deficient individuals exposed to arsenic was shown to significantly
increase methylation of arsenic when compared with
controls.787 Twice daily administration of spirulina extract (250 mg) and zinc (2 mg) to 41 people with toxic
arsenic levels was useful in treatment of arsenic-induced
melanosis and keratosis.788 Carotenoids have also been
found to be lower in arsenic-exposed workers, indicating that serum beta-carotene and vitamin A testing and
supplementation, as necessary, may protect from further
nutrient-mediated effects of exposure.789
When arsenic toxicity is suspected, other appropriate tests include testing arsenic levels in drinking water;
assessing methylation capacity (homocysteine, B12, folate, methylmalonic acid, FIGLU); measuring sulfur amino acids, metallothionein, markers of glutathione status,
and oxidative damage markers (see Chapter 6, “Organic
Acids”); as well as measuring essential elements.

Hair or nail arsenic represents several months of
exposure prior to taking the specimen.695 The concentration of arsenic in hair is typically greater than in other
tissues because of its high affinity for keratin, which is
rich in cysteine residues. Arsenic circulating in blood
binds keratin in hair or nails, trapping it at the time of
exposure. When arsenic exposure is removed, hair levels
in new growth return to normal within weeks.627 In one
study, hair, nail and urinary arsenic levels were comparable.771 Hair arsenic greater than 1 µg/g dry weight has
been taken to indicate excessive exposure.772 Arsenic
ingestion is associated with arsenic content in hair,773,774
but that has been disputed.769
Arsenic is rapidly cleared from the blood, as it combines readily with sulfhydryl groups of tissue proteins.
Since elevated arsenic in the serum drops within 6 to
10 hours, serum arsenic is not a good specimen for
determining chronic arsenic exposure. Whole blood is
suitable for identifying acute exposure to arsenic, and
high levels should be addressed immediately.775 There
is a paucity of information on erythrocyte arsenic in the
scientific literature.

Refer to Case Illustration 3.8

Urinary porphyrin profiling provides functional
markers of arsenic poisoning effects in the porphyrin
pathway used for heme biosynthesis. Single-dose arsenic
exposure of rats produces increases in protoporphyrin IX,
coproporphyrin III and coproporphyrin I in tissues and
urine.776, 777 Mice exposed to arsenic in drinking water
show a dose-response relationship with urinary coproporphyrin I after 12 months of exposure, along with less
dramatic increases of coproporphyrin III.778, 779 Fecal coproporphyrin I showed a specific positive response to arsenic exposure in geese.780 Drinking-water arsenic exposure
in rats produced multiple abnormalities in the porphyrin
pathway. Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)
activity was inhibited along with increase of zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) in blood.781 Human population survey
data confirm that both uroporphyrin III and coproporphyrin III increase in arsenic-exposed individuals.782

Management of the Arsenic-Toxic Patient
The arsenic antidotes DMPS and DMSA have
been favored because they demonstrate relatively low
toxicity with high therapeutic index, and they can be

Cadmium (Cd)

Iron deficiency anemia has been reported in chronic
cadmium toxicity.609
Cadmium is very similar to zinc. Both are group 12
transition metals, and as such, cadmium competes with
zinc at all cellular binding sites, which are generally rich
in sulfhydryl groups. The displacement of zinc from
an enzyme-active site results in loss of enzyme activity.
This type of toxicity is sometimes referred to as enzyme
poisoning.

Toxicity symptoms: Femoral pain, lumbago, osteopenia, renal
dysfunction, hypertension, vascular disease
Body burden assessment: Whole blood
Biochemical marker: Coproporphyrin I
Protective measures: Zinc, iron, antioxidants
Chelating agents: EDTA; DMSA and NAC (experimental)
Common sources: Industry, spray paint, tobacco smoke, car
emissions, plants grown in cadmium-rich soil

Clinical Associations of Cadmium Toxicity

The principal organs most vulnerable to cadmium
toxicity are kidney and lung. Environmental cadmium
exposure is associated with renal tubular damage and
high blood pressure.793 Numerous studies have shown
that acute inhalation exposure to cadmium can cause
death in humans and animals. During exposure, symptoms are usually mild, but within days following the
exposure, pulmonary edema and pneumonitis develop,
leading to death due to respiratory failure. Cadmium inhaltation has also been shown to exacerbate emphysema
in smokers.609 Over time, breathing aerosols containing
cadmium can lead to pulmonary congestion resembling
chronic emphysema. Other toxic cadmium effects,
including decreased testis size, impaired endocrine function (higher follicle-stimulating hormone and estrogen)
in men have been reported.794
Chronic exposure typically results in the slow
onset (over a period of years) of renal dysfunction with
proteinuria. Excretion of cadmium is proportional to
creatinine, except when renal damage has occurred.
Renal damage due to cadmium exposure can be detected
by increased cadmium excretion, due to the release of
intrarenal cadmium and decreased tubular resorption.
Renal damage also greatly reduces the activation of vitamin D and increases calcium excretion.609
Osteomalacia, osteoporosis and painful bone disorders have been reported in humans exposed to cadmium
in food; however, multiple risk factors are most often
present, including poor nutrition and multiparity. The
degree of loss of bone density has been correlated with
excretion of beta-2-microglobulin, a biomarker of renal
injury.453, 609

One of the most common routes and sources of
cadmium (Cd) exposure is inhalation of tobacco smoke,
which contains from 1 to 2 µg per cigarette. About 10%
of the cadmium in tobacco smoke enters systemic circulation. Indeed, certain laboratories measuring wholeblood cadmium maintain separate ranges for smokers,
as smoking is expected to more than double levels.453,
Cadmium is obtained as a by-product of zinc and
lead smelting, and is used in industry for electroplating, in the production of rechargeable batteries, and as
a paint pigment. The spray painting of organic-based
paints without use of protective breathing apparatus is a
common cause of chronic cadmium overexposure. Auto
mechanics are susceptible to cadmium toxicity from
automobile exhaust emissions. Foods susceptible to cadmium contamination include organ meats and shellfish,
which can contain between 100 and 1,000 micrograms
per kilogram weight. Plants are able to concentrate
cadmium, and it has been found in irrigation waters and
fertilizers. About 1 µg of cadmium is found in each liter
of breast milk. However, with some exceptions, cadmium has poor gastrointestinal bioavailability.609
Cadmium is primarily concentrated in liver and
kidney. Cadmium is absorbed and transported via
metallothionein and DMT1.791 Cadmium and lead
absorption is increased in iron-deficiency states via upregulated DMT1 expression, which may contribute to
the associated neurotoxicity of both elements.98, 282, 792
Notes:

Assessing Cadmium Body Burden
Whole-blood cadmium is indicative of recent exposure, and is therefore not reflective of total-body burden.
Normal concentration of whole-blood cadmium is up to

glutathione tripeptide are also likely valuable, given
that deficiency of the former and increased synthesis of
the latter have been demonstrated in cadmium toxicity.
Supplementation with zinc and selenium salts also can
reverse inhibitory effects of cadmium on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation and cytokine
release.801 Chelating agents used in cadmium toxicity
include EDTA, DMSA and N-acetylcysteine.2

Lead (Pb)
Toxicity symptoms: Microcytic hypochromic anemia, renal
dysfunction, hypertension, anorexia, muscle discomfort, constipation,
metallic taste, low IQ (children)

Body burden assessment: Whole blood, serum, hair, urinary
porphyrins

Protective measures: Calcium (reduces intestinal absorption),
alpha lipoic acid- protection against toxicity, iron (reduces intestinal
absorption)
Chelating agents: Ca –EDTA

Common sources: Certain supplements, paint, contaminated soils
(and plants grown in them), plumbing

Lead (Pb), a toxin known since antiquity, is widely
distributed in the environment, largely due to human
activity. Although leaded gasoline was phased out in
the early 1980s, lead is still found in the soil around
highways. Leaded paint was banned in 1972, but the
soil around many older homes painted with lead-based
paints is contaminated with lead. Indeed, lead-based
paint and its remnants remain the most significant
source of lead exposure in the United States among children living in older neighborhoods to this day. Remodeling older homes, which frees up lead dust even from
outside window frames, poses a significant exposure
(see Case Illustration 3.2). In this way, lead ingested by
mothers can be passed on to infants via breast milk.802–
Other sources of exposure include water transported
through old lead pipes or pipes joined by solders, both
of which can carry significant amounts of lead. Lead is
still found in paint products intended for non-domestic
use and in artist pigments.
Uptake and accumulation by crops grown in soil
contaminated with lead and other toxic metals provides
another health-threatening exposure source.691, 804, 805
Mobilization of lead-rich particles from highly contaminated soils in urban areas is an on-going health concern
for many large cities. Lactating Greek women residing
in urban areas demonstrated higher breast milk lead
levels than their non-urban counterparts.806 Even in

1 µg/L for non-smokers, and up to 4 µg/L for smokers.
Whole-blood levels of 10 µg/L have been associated with
renal dysfunction.
Urinary cadmium may be reflective of total-body
burden, although recent exposure will increase levels.
Monitoring urinary output of cadmium is an excellent
means of assessing exposure, given normal renal function. Daily output of cadmium of 2 to 4 µg per 24hour urine indicates toxicity (approximately 1–3 µg/g
creatinine).
Fecal cadmium has been used to assess recent
dietary intake, as gastrointestinal absorbtion is so low.
Hair levels of cadmium may be reflective of exposure, as
cadmium, like most toxic metals, concentrates in sulfhydryl groups, which are found in great abundance in
hair. However, as with most metals, care must be taken
to rule out exogenous contamination. Elevated hair cadmium has been demonstrated in smokers.453, 609
There are currently no good markers for assessment
of damage to lung parenchyma during acute inhalation
exposure of cadmium.
Infant height has been shown to vary inversely with
maternal blood cadmium measured at 30 to 32 gestational weeks in Japan.795 A large environmental survey
of toxic elements in German children has led to reference values of 0.5 µg/L in whole blood and 0.5 µg/L in
urine.796 Ukranian children who took zinc supplements
had blood cadmium levels in the upper quartile for
the study cohort, with significant difference compared
with non-supplementing children (0.25 µg/L vs. 0.21;
p = 0.032).797 The third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey revealed graded positive
association of urinary cadmium with serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (a glutathione synthesis marker) and
negative associations with serum vitamin C, carotenoids
and vitamin E (p for trends < 0.01). These associations
were significant in subgroups based on race, age, alcohol
consumption, smoking and body mass index, leading
to a conclusion that oxidant stress should be considered in the pathogenesis of cadmium-related diseases in
humans.

Mangaging the Cadmium-Toxic Patient
The toxic effects of cadmium may be reduced by
specific dietary components or supplements such as vitamins E and C and carotenoids, as well as the botanical
black cumin seeds,798-800 and if indicated, vitamin D.609
Repletion in iron and the amino acids comprising the

poisoning by cadmium mentioned earlier. Frequently,
these sulfhydryl groups are located within enzymes associated with antioxidation activity, such as glutathione
reductase and glutathione peroxidase. Loss of structure
of some proteins invariably leads to their instability
and loss of biological activity. Thus, increased oxidation
causing increased production of reactive oxygen species
is one by-product of lead toxicity.820 Proteins contained
within astrocytes of the nervous system and renal tubular cells are particularly susceptible to the structural
changes imposed by lead.821 Lead has also been demonstrated to interfere with a number of calcium-dependent ion channels, receptors, and enzymes, including
calmodulin,822 protein kinase C, L-type calcium- and
nicotinic acetylcholine-gated channels, and magnesiumdependent cGMP phosphodiesterase.823

Clinical Associations of Lead Toxicity

Pathology associated with lead involves most major
organ systems, including urinary, nervous, circulatory
(cardiovascular, hematologic and immunologic), gastrointestinal, skeletal, endocrine and reproductive.453, 820, 824
The CNS is particularly vulnerable to lead, as it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.825 Indeed, cognitive
dysfunction, neurobehavioral disorders and neurological damage have been associated with lead exposure at
blood levels previously considered normal.820 Chronic
lead exposure reduces nerve conduction velocity in
peripheral nerves in adult subjects without obvious
symptoms or signs of toxicity. Signs of hemopoietic
system involvement include microcytic, hypochromic
anemia with possible basophilic stippling of the erythrocytes. Although it is relatively rare in most populations,
bullet fragments embedded in soft tissue can cause lead
toxicity. Two years after a gunshot wound, a 14-year-old
girl had an 18-month course of chronic abdominal pain,
vomiting and anorexia that was traced to the lead toxicity from bullet fragments in her leg.826
Hyperactivity, anorexia, decreased play activity,
low intelligence quotient and poor school performance
have been observed in children with high lead levels.827
In children without obvious signs of lead intoxication,
bone lead content was related to subjective and nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fatigue, impaired concentration,
short-term memory deficits, insomnia, anxiety and irritability) and reduced performance on visual intelligence
and visual-motor coordination tests.828 In a landmark
meta-analysis of lead exposure effects in children,

areas far removed from industrial emission sources, lead
concentrations in the surface soil layers are far above
their natural concentration range.807 One study showed
eggs produced by free-range hens raised on contaminated soil contained high concentrations of numerous
toxic elements, including lead, mercury and thallium,
as well as organochlorines, including dichlorodiphenyl­
tricholroethane (DDT).808
Other sources of lead exposure include certain
herbal medicines, notably from China809 and India. An
Ayurvedic supplement called Chandraprabhavati was
found to contain 11 mg of lead per tablet. An individual
using the product demonstrated acute lead toxicity,
including a gingival lead line, anemia and basophilic
stippling.810 Calcium supplements have long been a
potential source of lead, especially those of bone and
dolomite origin.811-813
Exposure to lead can occur by ingestion, inhalation
or dermal contact. As much as 300 µg of lead per day
may be ingested in a normal diet. The majority of cases
of lead poisoning are due to oral ingestion and absorption through the gut. Well-nourished adults absorb
only about 1 to 10% of ingested lead, whereas children
can absorb as much as 50% of their dietary intake. The
absorption of lead is increased in patients with compromised gastrointestinal integrity and low dietary intakes
of calcium,814 magnesium,815, 816 iron, or vitamins C817
and D.818 Absorbed lead is rapidly incorporated into
bone and erythrocytes, though eventually, lead will
distribute into all tissues. An inverse correlation between
lead and calcium or magnesium in erythrocytes was
demonstrated in pregnant women, where elevated lead
was associated with increased incidence of pregnancyinduced hypertension and preeclampsia.815
Ingested lead is absorbed by the iron transport
protein divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) (see the
section “Iron” above). Low iron intake causes increased
synthesis of DMT1 to facilitate absorption of the available intestinal iron. The elevated DMT1 increases uptake
of lead (and cadmium), leading to greater rates of lead
accumulation in iron deficiency. DMT1 is also present in
the CNS, and in iron deficiency states may be implicated
as part of the pathogenesis of lead neurotoxicity. Thus,
iron repletion can protect against lead toxicity.98, 282, 819
Lead toxicity causes degeneration by several
mechanisms. The tertiary structures of proteins depend
on free sulfhydryl groups that are adversely affected by
lead’s affinity for cysteine residues, similar to the enzyme

lead concentrations were shown to be significantly
and positively correlated with teacher-rated learning
disabilities.829
Refer to Case Illustration 3.9

When not deposited in tissue, lead is excreted into
bile or urine. The kidney is susceptible to damage by
lead when it is exposed to high lead concentrations
during chelation treatments for lowering elevated body
burden. Renal competence should be assured by demonstration of normal creatinine clearance before beginning
any intervention to remove lead (or other heavy metal
contaminants).

Assessing Lead Body Burden
The use of urinary porphyrin profiling for detecting
low level effects of toxicants originated with observations regarding lead. Lead-specific effects on porphyrin
pathway intermediates have long been recognized in
medical literature.830, 831 Inhibition of heme synthesis
by lead results in a rise in urinary coproporphyrin and
erythrocyte protoporphyrin. A significant hallmark of
lead toxicity is anemia due to the lack of heme.
Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)
and ferrochelatase, the second and last enzymes of the
committed pathway of heme biosynthesis, are inhibited
by lead (see Chapter 8, “Toxicants and Detoxification”).
Porphyrin pathway products have been evaluated for
their sensitivity to low-level lead exposure and their
magnitude of change in response to levels of exposure
in rats. In order of decreasing sensitivity and decreasing
magnitude of change they rank: urinary coproporphyrin
> zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP)/heme > ALAD.132 Thus,
urinary coproporphyrin testing rivals whole-blood lead
for sensitivity, and it offers the advantage of showing
functional toxic effects in addition to revealing exposure.
Hair keratin has a high affinity for lead owing to its
high fraction of sulfhydyl-containing cysteine residues relative to other amino acids. Thus, hair lead is a
sensitive measure of lead exposure. Populations living in rural, urban and smelter areas had median hair
lead of 9.1, 15.3 and 48.5 ppm, respectively. For those
in apparent steady-state lead balance, hair levels were
well correlated with blood lead.832 Normally, hair lead
content is < 5 µg/g. Lead levels > 25 µg/g indicate severe
lead exposure. A strong dose-response relationship

was found for hair lead as a predictor of teacher rating among school children in Boston.833 Although hair
lead is one of the most sensitive indicators of exposure,
ZPP is more closely correlated with intellectual impairment in lead-exposed adults because the porphyrin test
reveals functional pathway impairment rather than only
exposure.834 Results such as these attest to the variability
among individuals with regard to susceptibility to the
toxic effects of lead.
Serum or plasma is not a very useful specimen for
lead screening except in cases of very recent exposure.
This is because serum lead returns to normal levels
within 3 to 5 days of last exposure. Urinary lead concentrations increase with lead poisoning, although urinary
elimination of lead is a process that occurs for many
days after a single exposure. Treatment with EDTA or
BAL (also used for chelating arsenic, gold and mercury)
accelerates the urine excretion rate of lead; thus, this
therapy is useful for revealing lead exposure.
Whole blood is concentrated about 75-fold greater
than that of serum or plasma, and it has the highest
correlation with toxicity. For this reason, whole-blood
lead is defined by the Centers for Disease Control as the
preferred test for detecting lead exposure. The World
Health Organization has defined high whole-blood
lead levels as > 20 µg/dL in adults and > 10 µg/dL in
children. The first German Environmental Survey on
Children has proposed lowering reference values for
whole-blood lead from 6 to 5 µg/dL.796 As of 2007, the
CDC acceptable level of whole-blood lead was 10 µg/dL.
Proposals have been made to reduce it to 5 µg/dL,
although the safe threshold for blood lead levels in
children and in utero may be even lower.694, 835-837 Lead
exposure can produce cognitive deficits at commonly
encountered blood levels.838 Although one study of
prenatal lead exposure demonstrated a lack of threshold
below which effects on IQ disappear,839 the findings
have been challenged as a statistical artifact.819

Notes:

personality change that puzzled friends and close associates. Posthumous analysis of archived samples of
Newton’s hair revealed highly elevated concentrations of
mercury, which is evidence that supports the historical
hypothesis that Issac Newton’s “madness” was a result of
his exposure to the toxic metal while he was conducting
experiments to study its properties.843
The human population is exposed daily to naturally
occurring mercury. The earth’s crust releases approximately 30,000 tons of mercury per year as a product
of natural outgassing from rock. Mining, smelting and
combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal, are a primary source of anthropomorphic mercury exposure.609
Approximately 6,000 tons/year of mercury are used in
the manufacture of electrical switches, for electrolysis,
and as a fungicide. Ninety tons of mercury are used
each year for making dental amalgams. According to
the CDC, mercury released from amalgams may comprise up to 75% of an individual’s mercury exposure.
The amount of mercury released from amalgams ranges
between 1.2 to greater than 27 µg/d.609 Toxicity associated with mercury amalgams continues to be a serious
concern, particularly in regard to pregnant women, as
mercury is a known neuroteratogen.453
In its elemental form, mercury (Hg0) is non-toxic.
However, once chemically or enzymatically altered to
the ionized, inorganic form (Hg2+), it becomes toxic.
Thus, bioconversion of mercury to its organic alkyl
forms renders some forms such as methyl mercury
highly toxic with great avidity for the nervous system.
Another commonly encountered organomercury compounds is ethylmercury that is released from thimerosal.844 Microorganisms in the environment and in the human intestinal tract can bioconvert non-toxic elemental
mercury to inorganic Hg2+ and organic mercurous alkyl
compounds. Methylmercury is highly water soluble
and readily enters aquatic food chains, accumulating at
higher concentrations in the tissue as it moves up the
food chain of marine organisms. Bioaccumulation of
methylmercury in organisms at the top of the aquatic
food chain is on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 times
greater than concentration in the ambient waters.845
Indeed, methylmercury from seafood is considered to be
the most important source of non-occupational human
mercury exposure.845 Analysis of commercial fish in New
Jersey markets found bioaccumulation to be the highest
(in descending order of magnitude) in yellow fin tuna,
Chilean sea bass, bluefish and snapper.846

Mercury (Hg)

Prevention continues to be the best route for reducing toxic effects of lead.840, 841 Thus far, large trials such
as the Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) effort,
employing chelation treatments with succimer or treating nutrient deficiencies with zinc and iron have failed
to show improved cognitive performance. This work has
been challenged on the grounds of poor chelator choice
and inadequate supplement dosing and duration. When
elevated lead levels are detected in individual patients,
treatment needs to be immediate, since chronic exposure, particularly in children is associated with poor
prognosis. That said, the chelation agent of choice for
the lead-toxic patient remains intravenous calcium disodium EDTA. Research continues to demonstrate efficacy
using EDTA in adults. In one study, long-term IV EDTA
in individuals with non-diabetic chronic renal disease
and blood lead > 60 µg/dL was shown to significantly
slow the progression of renal insufficiency as compared
with controls.842
Nutritional and adjunctive support for the lead-toxic patient includes promoting gastrointestinal integrity
and supplementing with calcium,814 magnesium,815, 816
iron, and vitamins C817 and D.814 Carotenoids have also
been found to be lower in lead-exposed workers.789
Nutrients with demonstrated benefit when used with or
without chelating agents include alpha lipoic acid, zinc,
taurine, selenium—which is able to bind lead directly—
and N-acetylcysteine.820

Mercury (Hg) as a neurotoxin has an intriguing
history. The phrase “mad as a hatter” has its origins with
the seventeenth and eighteenth century hat makers who
suffered from mercurialism due to their use of liquid
mercury in the manufacture of the popular felt-brimmed
hats. Sir Issac Newton, the famous seventeenth century
physicist, experienced a year of dark moods and marked

Figure 3.18 — Thimerosal

Although lack of data makes precise comparisons
of safe levels of exposures to different forms of mercury difficult, we may gain insight about the potential
for toxic effects from the available data on mercuric
chloride, ethylmercury and methlmercury. Thimerosal,
a mercury-containing preservative used in vaccines,
has been a common source of mercury exposure for
children. In the human body, thimerosal releases ethyl­
mercury (see Figure 3.18). In 2002, it was demonstrated
that the mean total mercury dose in vaccines received
by 6-month-olds was 111.3 µg (range 87–175 µg).847
In a 6.2 kg infant, 111.3 µg translates to 18 µg/kg/d or
about 2.6 times the adult minimal risk level (MRL) of
7 µg/kg/d for acute mercuric chloride exposure.609, 847,
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets
a reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 µg/kg body weight/d for
chronic exposure to methylmercury, at which there are
no recognized effects. Using the EPA’s RfD, a vaccination
containing 111.3 µg mercury would expose a 6.2 kg infant to 29 times the safe level for chronic methylmercury
exposure.849 Based on such inferences, governmental
health authorities now advocate removal of thimerosalcontaining childhood vaccines.850

Thimerosal has been widely used to preserve vaccines
used for immunizations. The mercury thioether structure
of thimerosal can be metabolized or chemically degraded
to release the much more toxic ethylmercury.

There are three known ways by which toxic effects
are produced by mercury: (1) It reacts with sulfhydryl
groups impairing the activity of enzymes, (2) it generates
protein adducts that are immunogenic, and (3) its highly
lipophilic alkyl forms alter nerve membrane function.453
Autoimmune glomerulonephritis in mercury-exposed
individuals has suggested an association between exposure and autoimmunity in humans.851, 852
Mercury intoxication, in turn, can produce a triad
of symptoms: (1) mental changes, (2) spontaneous
tremor and deficits in psychomotor performance, and
(3) stomatitis and gingivitis. The mental effects include
erethism (excessive irritability, excitability or sensitivity
to stimulation), depression, short-term memory loss, difficulty concentrating, insomnia and fatigue. Additional
signs of neurotoxicity include loss of vision, hyperreflexia, sensory disturbances, imparement of speech and
hearing, hyperhidrosis and muscular rigidity. Signs and
symptoms of mercury intoxication involving other organ
systems include renal and gastrointestinal disturbances,
pain in joints and limbs, weight loss, metallic taste in the
mouth and increased susceptibility to infections.453, 845
Mercury released from dental amalgams, which
are composed of as much as 50% mercury, can have
a negative impact on an individual’s health. Although
mercury-containing amalgams have been in use for over
100 years, their use was intensely debated at the turn of
the century and again in the 1930s. Small yet measurable amounts of mercury are continuously released from
the amalgam surface; the rate of release is accelerated by
hot liquids and chewing. Normal bacterial flora converts
a fraction of the released elemental mercury to its toxic
forms, Hg2+ and alkyl mercury. A portion of the elemental mercury released from amalgams is unavoidably
inhaled into the lungs, where it can be biotransformed
to its toxic forms.453 Studies have suggested that chronic
mercury exposure in amounts released by amalgams

Notes:

provokes an increase in both mercury- and antibioticresistant strains of bacteria in the oral and intestinal flora.
Such mercury-induced aquired resistance to antibiotics
has been found worldwide in fish and soil bacteria.853
Epidemiologic data from the US EPA and CDC have
led to estimates that more than 300,000 newborns each
year may have increased risk of learning disabilities
associated with in utero exposure to methylmercury.858

Chinese children with both inattentive and combined
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have
blood mercury levels higher than controls. Risk of
ADHD was found to be nearly 10 times higher when
blood mercury was above 29 nmol/L.859
With the pronounced rise in the incidence of
autism over the last decades,860 much debate continues regarding mercury’s role in the pathogenesis of this

Toxic element accumulation is dependent on
route and duration of exposure, form of toxic element
and presence of protective measures. For example,
rats maintained for 18 months on low-selenium diets
and consuming drinking water containing 5.0 ppm of
mercury as methylmercury had 10-fold higher mercury
in brain compared with those given water with 0.5
ppm mercury.854 However, brain mercury increased
only slightly in similarly exposed rats fed diets with
high selenium content (0.6 vs. 0.06 ppm), and no
increase was seen at lower levels of exposure, showing
the protective effect of dietary selenium.
Another important observation from these
experiments was that mercury was higher in neonatal
rats that also had lower retention of selenium,
and blood and brain mercury levels fell with age
as selenium levels stabilized. Such results raise
timing issues and possible protective measures.
Administration of vitamin C, glutathione or lipoic acid
in combination with DMPS or DMSA to young rats
for 7 days following a 7-day exposure to elemental
mercury vapor had no effect on brain mercury.855
Here, the toxic element form was elemental versus
methyl mercury, and administration was by inhalation
for 7 days rather than ingestion for 18 months. The
protective measures were administered for only 7
days and only after exposure had occurred. Longerterm administration of the protective nutrients might
produce quite different results, especially if tissue
levels are raised before exposure.856
Kidney mercury in the rats
exposed to mercury vapor was
lowered by DMPS and DMSA,
but no combination was found
to affect levels in brain. These
results provide insight about

differences in tissue distribution and ligand character.
In metallothionein-rich kidney tissue, bound mercury
is more dissociable than that bound to enzymes in
the brain. Such differences among tissues in their
sequestration tendencies leads to concern about
potential redistribution induced by therapies that cause
mobilization of toxic metals. Thus mercury released
from extrahepatic tissues might transfer to brain as a
result of chelation therapies. Very little is known about
how much such redistribution actually occurs for
any given chelator. Such effects may account for the
suggestions that treatments of past mercury exposures
with N-acetylcysteine or reduced glutathione may be
counterproductive.857
For toxic elements other than mercury, the
constant redistribution over time produces an accrual
in bone, where they are bound in the hydroxyappetite
matrix. These forms are of lower concern (and low
contribution to laboratory element testing) until they
are remobilized during bone resorption. Such issues
complicate the evaluation and treatment of patients
with toxic element effects.

up to 15 µg/L. Significant exposure is evident when
whole-blood alkyl mercury is greater than 50 µg/L, or
when Hg2+ exposure is greater than 200 µg/L.
Based on the first German Environmental Survey on
Children, lowering of reference values for whole-blood
mercury from 1.5 to 1.0 µg/L has been proposed.796
Consumption of large amounts of fish by pregnant
women in Hong Kong results in prenatal exposure to
moderately high levels of mercury shown by finding
cord-blood mercury levels above 29 nmol/L (5.8 µg/L)
in newborn infants.868 A separate study found that, compared with the national average, women who ate fish
were 3 times more likely to have elevated cord-blood
levels. Of the 275 women who completed the study,
28.3% had cord-blood mercury above the 5.8 µg/L
reference level set by the EPA.869 In a random sample
of 474 subjects in Baltimore, Maryland, 9% had blood
mercury levels above the 5.8 µg/L limit.870 However, elevated levels (> 5.8 µg/L) are found in 16.5 % of women
in populations with high fish consumption.871
Blood mercury has revealed low level chronic and
acute exposure from work environments,872 whereas
elevations of mercury have been reported as high as
16,000 µg/L in blood and 11,000 µg/L in urine.873 At
massive elevation levels, interpretation is straightforward, allowing assessment of patient exposure factors
and clinical consequences. As with most tests performed on a broadly varying outpatient population,
interpretation of results from measurements of mercury
in blood or urine become more difficult as concentrations approach the population norms of 10 to 20 µg/L.
Concurrent or follow-up testing of biomarkers that
show toxic consequences, such as elevated porphyrins,

neurodevelopmental condition.847, 861 Although research
does point to the eitiology of autism being multifactorial,
numerous reports demonstrate that aspects of mercury
toxicity appear similar to autism symptomatology.862-864
In 2002, thimerosal was phased out of some vaccines,
as recommended by the US Public Health Service and
the American Academy of Pediatrics.850, 861 Data from
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
reported a significant reduction in the proportion of
neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, mental
retardation and speech disorders, as thimerosal was
removed from childhood vaccines in the United States
from mid-1999 onward.865 As of the date of this writing, since regulations do not govern all sources, vaccines
must still be verified as thimerosal free.
In addition to the previously discussed nutritional
factors, gender and age can also influence mercury status
and toxic consequences. In an Austrian population with
generally low levels of mercury, values in males were
influenced by fish intake, amalgan fillings, age and education level, whereas those for females varied only with
dietary fish intake, indicating gender-specific effects.866
In older Americans, visual memory ability declines as
blood mercury levels rise, although other neurological
tests such as finger tapping were uaffected.867

Assessing Mercury Body Burden and Toxic Effects

A primary function of the clinical laboratory is to
assist clinicians in making decisions about when to
treat a patient for heavy metal toxicity. However, there
is considerable debate over how to establish reference
limits for mercury (and other toxic metals) on clinical
laboratory reports. The US EPA RfD for chronic mercury
exposure of 0.1 µg/kg/d is equivalent to a total exposure
of 7 µg/d in a 70 kg adult. If the amount of mercury
absorbed from dental amalgams is combined with all
other sources of mercury (e.g., fish, environmental,
occupational and medicinal), the daily exposure to mercury is expected to exceed the RfD for some individuals.
In populations such as occupationally exposed workers
and the elderly, the percentage of mercury-threatened
individuals can be much higher. Based on a study of
normal, presumably healthy populations, mean wholeblood mercury concentration was found to be < 5 µg/L.
About 1% of this population had whole-blood levels of
mercury greater than 5 µg/L. Individuals with occupational exposure to mercury, such as dentists and dental
technicians, may routinely have whole-blood mercury

Notes:

status of thiols such as glutathione, cysteine or lipoic
acid shift the dynamics of mercury’s effects, as do the
levels of metallothionein, zinc and selenium, or even
glutamine.857 Specific patterns of urinary porphyrin
abnormalities have been clearly associated with mercury, providing a convenient and sensitive biochemical
marker of metabolic toxicity. See Chapter 8, “Toxicants
and Detoxification,” for further discussion of urinary
porphyrin profiling for detecting clinically significant
mercury exposure.

Management of the Mercury-Toxic Patient

Removing the source and optimizing routes of
mercury elimination should be the first treatment for
mercury toxicity. Antioxidant intervention may be
helpful for mitigating the oxidative damage caused by
mercury toxicity. Some antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid and glutathione may posess
chelative effects.2, 856 Selenium has been demonstrated to
effectively bind mercury, rendering the mercury ineffective (see the section “Selenium” above). More aggressive
treatment for mercury toxicity calls for chelation therapy.
Administration of BAL, penicillamine, EDTA, DMSA
or DMPS will mobilize mercury and cause a rise in the
daily urinary mercury excretion rate. The preferred chelation agents, based on their affinity for mercury and low
toxicity, are DMSA or DMPS.2 All of these agents should
be used with monitoring of mercury metabolic toxicity,
since they can mobilize relatively inert bound forms of
mercury.857 If porphyrin profile signs start to worsen,
treatment may need to be suspended until newly mobilized mercury reaches equilibration with metallothionein
and other routes of binding for excretion.
Removing brain accumulations of mercury is a
challenge. DMSA and DMPS may not be effective agents
for removing toxic metals found in the CNS, as they
are very unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier. It
has been suggested that alpha-lipoic acid may cross the
blood-brain barrier, and combinations of ascorbic acid
and glutathione may help to allow mercury transport
away from tissues by altering the ionic form. However,
when combinations of these interventions were tested
in mercury-exposed rats, no reduction in brain mercury
was found.855

beta-2-microglobulin or N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine
can be very helpful.
The level of mercury in urine is a reliable way to
assess exposure to inorganic mercury. Daily urinary
levels greater than 50 µg indicate a Hg2+ overload. Hair
levels of mercury greater than 1 µg/g also indicate mercury toxicity. The quantity of mercury assayed in blood
and hair, but not urine, correlates with the severity of
toxicity symptoms.
Erythrocyte mercury shows a strong relationship
with erythrocyte selenium, suggesting a chemical linkage between the two elements.563 Erythrocyte mercury
was strongly correlated with plasma mercury, and both
mercury and selenium levels were strongly correlated
with fish intake.563
Hair has been a frequently used specimen by
CDC and EPA for accurately assessing mercury exposure
in selected populations.845, 849, 858A number of studies have shown positive associations between mercury
concentrations in blood and hair. Hair to blood ratios
ranging from 200 for maternal hair-cord blood to 360
for hair-blood values in 7-year-old children have been
reported.874 Populations of Brazilian communities
showed a positive correlation of blood pressure with
levels of hair mercury. At levels above 10 µg/g, the odds
ratio for elevated systolic blood pressure was 2.9.875
Both blood and hair mercury levels drop between the
second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Maternal hair
correlates with cord blood, both levels being related to
fish intake.876
Measurement of mercury concentrations in body
tissues or fluids provides evidence of exposure, but
it does not answer the question of toxic effects that
are dependent on many other factors. Variations in

have been confirmed in subsequent animal studies.453,
Although minimal uranium is found in food and
water,453, 880 one study has demonstrated increased bone
turnover in men exposed to naturally occuring uraniumrich drinking water.881
Uranium toxicity in humans leads to renal damage.
Experimental studies demonstrate hyaline cast formation
and necrosis of tubular cells. Additionally, pronounced
deregulation of genes has been illustrated, particularly
in relation to calcium transport and nephroblastomarelated genes. Lung cancer is commonly associated with
inhaled uranium, as the particles are radioactive, and
larger particles will localize to lung parenchyma.878, 879
Assessment of uranium is challenging, and may
require assessment of proteins impacted by known genetic alterations.878 Chromosomal aberrations consistent
with uranium exposure have been shown to be effective
biomarkers of strong past or current exposure.882, 883
Uranium is rapidly cleared from the body (75% in
5 minutes and 95% in 5 hours post-exposure). The
element is able to bind to transferrin and albumin in
blood, and uranium phosphate has been found in bone,
suggesting an ability to replace calcium. Urine can be
a sensitive specimen for uranium exposure, but assessment should be undertaken promptly.884
Uranium exposure has been treated by IV infusion
of 1.4% sodium bicarbonate. Although no chelating
agents are US FDA-approved, inositol hexaphosphate
demonstrated efficacy in animal studies.878

The position of thallium (Th) in the periodic table
with aluminum and gallium and between lead and mercury suggests that it may be toxic to humans. Thallium
is a tasteless toxin that has a long criminal history as a
poison. Severe, painful neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms occur from thallium poisoning; alopecia
is the most characteristic sign, as it is coupled with a
black pigment at the hair root.877 Thallium is present in
cigarette smoke, and is readily taken up by plants grown
in contaminated soil. Thallium alloyed with mercury is
used in low-temperature thermometers. Thallium sulfate
was banned as a rodenticide and pesticide in 1972, but
poisoning by exposure to old treatment sites constitutes
the main source of current exposure.609 It has a medicinal history as treatment for ringworm, gout, tuberculosis
and gonorrhea.
Thallium’s mechanism of toxicity is based on
substitution of potassium in Na/K pumps and interference sulfhydryl residues on enzymes, particularly in the
mitochondrial electron transport chain. Specimens used
for thallium detection include urine, which is the main
route of excretion, and hair.453, 627 Blood levels have been
measured, but thallium is rapidly cleared, so exposure
must be acute to achieve accurate results.609
The use of BAL, d-penicillamine or EDTA are
contraindicated for treatment, as they have been shown
to severely redistribute the toxicant. DMSA may be an
appropriate alternative, although it does not effectively
cross the blood-brain barrier. Prussian blue is currently
used.2 Treating the GI tract with activated charcoal may
be effective for removal of ingested thallium. Potassium
intravenous drips improve dieuresis of thallium.453, 877

Thallium (Th)

Uranium (U)
Although uranium (U) has always been abundant
on earth, its widespread use in military and industry
uses, including nuclear power, has increased human
exposure. Uranium can be ingested or inhaled and is
cleared in urine rapidly, although some will pool in
bone and kidney tissues.609 High concern is placed
on the toxicity of depleted uranium.878 World War II

to uranium that demonstrated effects on reproduction

Tin (Sn)
Tin (Sn) is used in PVC, glass coverings, silicone
and wood preservative, paints, biocides and pesticides,885 and medicines, including Ayurvedic886, 887
treatments. The most common route of exposure may be
as stannous (tin) fluoride in dentrifices. Detailed reviews
have been done of tin-containing antitumor agents888,
and tin in wastewater.890 Carcinogenicity has been
demonstrated in a limited way in human and animal
studies. Lipophilic organic trimethyltin compounds
display immunotoxic effects. Neonatal rats exposed to
tin displayed stunted growth and thymic atrophy. Tin
has been shown to be neurotoxic, specifically in the
hippocampal region, although the mechanism has yet to
be elucidated.890
Specimens used for assessment of tin exposure
include urine and blood, which may be useful for both
acute and chronic exposure.609

Titanium (Ti)

Although scant evidence exists for treatment
of trimethyltin, compounds such as BAL and
DMSA have demonstrated limited efficacy toward
tributyltin.891, 892 Selenium was protective against the
high incidence of lung cancer in tin miners shown to
be selenium deficient.893

Few human toxicological studies have been conducted for titanium (Ti) compounds. Inhaled titanium
was associated with increased lung fibrosis.902 Titanium
alloys used in surgical implants have not demonstrated
any carcinogenic potential. Some animal studies have
demonstrated carcinogenic potential, primarily with
intramuscular injections of pure titanium, titanocene or
titanium dioxide compounds.453, 902 A higher presence
of inflammatory markers such as nitric oxide synthase
(NOS) in tissue was observed with titanium versus
zirconium dental implants.903 Evidence for titanium biomarkers is limited, although hair and serum specimens
have been shown to correlate with exposure.685, 904

Conclusions

Most individuals consuming a standard western diet
have significant risk of one or more essential element
deficiencies. Populations such as the elderly, pregnant
women, small children and immunocompromised
patients are particularly vulnerable to essential element
deficiencies. Hypertension, eczema, neurological abnormalities and pain are only a few of the clinical ramifications of a deficiency of essential elements or toxic metal
effects. Most of the top causes of mortality in the United
States may be associated with essential element deficiencies. Symptoms of deficiencies may be vague and
difficult to diagnose.
The impact of toxic element exposure is exacerbated
by nutrient element deficiencies via a variety of mechanisms. The synergy of multiple toxic element exposures
can result in clinical effects that supersede those of a
single toxic element exposure. As a result, defininitions
of safe levels for exposure to toxic elements continue to
be lowered.
Treatments for toxic element-burdened patients
include minimizing sources of exposure, normalizing
routes of elimination, and implementing metabolic
support and antioxidant repletion. In addition, most patients can be guided to dietary and lifestyle practices that
will improve their tolerance to toxic elements. Clinical
interventions can help raise tolerance by focused corrections of nutritional insufficiencies, especially regarding
status of glutathione and amino acids, plus cofactors that
can assist the production of metallothionein. In those
cases where toxic element exposure leads to metabolic

Antimony (Sb) is a potentially toxic element
with no known biological function. Although it is
less toxic than arsenic,453 antimony is a similar group
V metalloid with the capacity to interrupt enzyme
sulfhydryl groups.894 Antimony-based compounds are
used as a flame retardant material in draperies, wall
coverings and carpets. Antimony is present in cosmetic
products. Other materials containing antimony include
alloys, ceramics, glass, plastic and synthetic fabrics.895
Antimony is present in incinerators, smelters and fossilfuel combustion.
Since antimony is known to be absorbed through
the dermal layer in animal studies, it has been speculated that antimony toxicity may play a role in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), where children are
sleeping on antimony-containing fibers. A number of
studies have associated significantly elevated antimony
in both hair and liver samples of children who died
from SIDS,896, 897 although other work has challenged the
validity of the findings.890
Antimony preparations are first-line interventions for parasite exposure, mainly schistosomiasis and
leishmaniasis, although antimony-resistant species of
leishmaniasis are increasing in frequency.898 Antimony
toxicity presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
hematuria, hemolytic anemia and renal failure. Subclinical exposure could result in increased reactive oxygen
species and increased apoptosis. In one study, the presence of urinary antimony was closely associated with
peripheral arterial disease.899
Because whole-blood antimony is cleared from the
blood slowly over months, it best reflects chronic exposure.900 Urine has shown good correlation with acute
antimony exposure.901
Antimony is excreted via bile and urine as a glutathione conjugate. Treatment for antimony exposure is
the chelating agent BAL453 or DMSA. N-acetylcysteine
may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy to support glutathione synthesis

Antimony (Sb)

Continued improvements in laboratory methods
may provide comprehensive element evaluations that
include multiple specimens (RBC, urine, hair and stool)
and functional markers. The use of appropriately dosed
essential element dietary supplements based on need
demonstrated by laboratory results can significantly
improve the safety and efficacy of interventions. Once an
abnormality in element status is identified in a patient,
follow-up testing of elements in appropriate specimen
types can provide evidence to the clinician that imbalances in nutrient and toxic elements have been resolved.

compromise, utilization of appropriate chelating agents
may also be required.
Accurate assessment of essential and toxic element
status followed by appropriate treatment is required.
Laboratory evaluations provide both direct concentration information and functional markers for assessing
element status. Elements can be measured in whole
blood, erythrocytes, or challenged or unchallenged urine
or hair. Urinary porphyrin profiling can show metabolic
toxicity. Single specimen profiles can reveal potential
weaknesses and exposures, but testing of multiple specimen types is the preferred evaluation for reaching firm
clinical conclusions. Each element has unique physiological properties, so the most sensitive and specific tests
for evaluating a patient vary according to the element of
focused therapy.

A 49-Year-Old Female Undergoing Chelation
with Multiple Lab Assessments
Diagnosis: Lead Poisoning

History of Present Illness: Pam, a 49-year-old female,
had struggled with neurological problems for over two years.
Symptoms included muscle spasms, twitching, stiffness, and
pain. She could not walk short distances comfortably and
had problems getting out of chairs and balancing. She was
very fatigued and went to bed at 7 P.M. every night.
She visited the Mayo clinic and received a diagnosis
of cramp fasciculation syndrome, also called stiff person
syndrome. She then visited Johns Hopkins where she was
diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. She had been tested for

toxic metals with a 24 h urine test previously and arsenic
was high-normal, but the clinician did not treat for heavy
metal toxicities. She had undergone physical therapy but
reached a plateau with some improvement of her symptoms.
Past Medical History: She had an osteosarcoma removed
from her arm.
Social/Work/Environmental History: Pam is a registered
nurse who lived for 20 years in a house that had lead paint.
The lead exposure was verified by measurements taken
by the local Board of Health. She had the paint on her
windows removed and reglazed and she cleaned up the
Continued on following page…

paint dust. Her work is one mile from a coal incinerator and
downstream of a waste incinerator.
Family History: Pam’s parents are alive and healthy
without neuromuscular complaints.
Treatment and Results: Careful elemental status
assessment led to the diagnosis of chronic metal toxicity. The
directing physician tested Pam’s erythrocyte elements (panels
1A and 1B) and whole blood toxic elements (panels 2A and
2B) on 2/20/06, 5/17/06, and on 8/17/06. Further, he tested
urinary elements after provocation with EDTA on 3/20/06,
with DMPS on 5/11/06, and with EDTA on 8/11/06 (panels
3A and 3B). Pam was given weekly intravenous chelation
treatments and intravenous B vitamins, essential elements,
and vitamin C. The patient also took oral nutritional
supplements. The most recent urine challenge test shows
somewhat higher lead and aluminum levels than previously
found (results not shown).
Erythrocyte toxic elements were within normal limits
throughout, although lead levels show systematic decreases
to undetectable levels at the end of treatments. The
chelation treatments caused lowering of essential elements
in the RBC between 2/20/06 and 5/17/06, at which time
the patient had low status of many nutrient elements. On
8/17/06 levels had plateaued or had increased, indicating
more aggressiveness in supplementation of nutrient
elements. These data illustrate the benefit from evaluating
essential element status during chelation treatment to
assure their protection against toxic effects of mobilized
heavy metals.
Levels of arsenic and aluminum were initially above
the reference limit (panels 2A and 2B) and they showed
progressive decreases over the three time-points. In August
aluminum increased slightly, suggesting ongoing exposure or
mobilization of aluminum sequestered in bone. There was no

Notes:
significant change in whole blood cadmium, lead or mercury.
Levels in whole blood are affected by recent exposure and
chelation treatments that mobilize elements into circulation
before excretion.
Urinary excretion of arsenic gradually increased with
treatment (panels 3A and 3B). Cadmium, lead, and mercury
showed similarly elevated urinary excretion on 3/20/06 and
on 8/11/06, following the use of EDTA for mobilization
challenge. However, the use of the much more specific
mercury binding agent, DMPS, on 5/11/06 produced
elevated mercury excretion with normal values for cadmium
and lead. During successful chelation therapy, urinary
excretion of toxic elements is expected to be initially high,
falling to normal levels after the course of treatments has
extended for sufficient time to allow clearance from various
body tissues. The consistent presence of various elevated
levels among the group of toxic elements, however, indicates
that continued efforts to lower body burdens is needed.
Pam says she is, “doing really, really, well.” She says that
her tremors have stopped and she has doubled her strength.
She is jogging now for the first time in 2.5 years. She can
walk now for three miles and is biking also. She says, “I feel
like I’ve been given my life back. I thought I would be in a
wheelchair for the rest of my life.” She can now get out of
chairs without losing her balance.
This case shows the interplay between essential and
toxic element concentrations in erythrocytes, whole
blood and urine as a patient with elevated toxic element
body burden is given intravenous chelation treatments.
At the biochemical level, many interactions between the
various elements make predictions of clinical outcomes
from laboratory data alone impossible. Patient responses
must guide treatment with the expectation that, with
sufficient time, the treatment will lower toxic element levels
throughout the body and measured levels will consistently
drop within normal limits. v

Multiple lab assessments were used to evaluate Pam’s chelation treatment over a 6 month time frame. Nutrient and toxic elements in erythrocytes
are shown in 1A. The dates of collection, 2/20/2006, 5/17/2006 and 8/17/2006 are listed above each column of results. Quantitative results for toxic
elements over 6 months are depicted in the bar graph (1B). The blue bar denotes reference limits. Similarly, panel 2A shows results for whole blood toxic
elements, while 2B represents those changes graphically over 3 time-points. Panel 3A shows results from testing of 6 to 8 hour urinary excretion of toxic
elements upon provocation, and 3B shows the bar chart representation of those changes. The values shown in shaded boxes are above 5th quintile limits,
but less than 95% interval high limits.

After treatment, the patient felt more energy than she
had for years. She reported warmer body temperature,
thicker hair and nails, resolution of fluid retention and
her normalized body weight. She was able to decrease her
dose of Armour Thyroid from 90 mg BID to 45 mg BID,
and, if she misses an afternoon dose she feels fine. The
patient continues to take thyroid hormone to avoid risk of
recurrence of goiter in the remaining lobe, although there
is no current evidence of goiter. The frank iodine deficiency
found in this case brings into question the need for
thyroidectomy without thorough iodine status evaluation. v

Results

This 53-year-old white female had a partial thyroidectomy
(right lobe) 10 years ago. Several aspirations from the right
lobe had been done over the three years prior to actual
thyroid surgery. The aspiration needle biopsies always
showed “a benign colloid lesion.” An ultrasound 13 years ago
described the right lobe as a “large, complex, predominantly
cystic mass which statistically most likely reflects a benign
nodule but the sonographic appearance is nonspecific and
additional etiologies cannot be excluded.” Her TSH levels
during that time remained within normal limits. A total T4
level was in the lower normal range prior to surgery.
Eight years after her partial thyroidectomy, while on
Armour Thyroid, she had a TSH level of 0.5 uIU/mL (0.35–
5.50 normal limits). A 24 hour urine iodine loading test and
an overnight urinary iodine were measured. The loading
test included an oral dose of 50 mg of potassium iodide and
collection of urine for the next 24 hours. The premise of this
test is that if the patient is deficient in iodine, a large portion
of the iodine bolus will be retained, resulting in low urinary
iodine excretion. In an iodine-replete patient, more than
90% of the bolus will be excreted.
The overnight urinary iodide concentration was low,
consistent with iodine deficiency. Only 19 mg of the 50 mg
oral bolus was excreted in 24 hours. The 37% excretion/24
hr result further indicated iodine deficiency. The patient was
treated with 25 to 50 mg potassium iodine/iodide daily for 6
months and retested.

Toxic Elements in Urine of Patients
Living in Western Massachusetts
all or most of their lives in Berkshire County. The data
are from 24-hour urine specimens obtained after DMSA
provocation. They show elevated body burdens of lead and,
in one case, simultaneous very high arsenic exposure. In
addition to treatment for toxic metal burden, a thorough
investigation of the potential sources for these exposures,
including but not limited to water, water pipes and house
paint is indicated for all three of the patients. v

Berkshire County is in rural western Massachusetts. The
area drew early European immigrant settlement because of
the powerful Housatonic River that runs southward through
the county. In addition to industrial facilities such as the
General Electric Plastics Processing Plant that poured nonbiodegradable organic compounds such as PCBs into the
Housatonic, heavy agricultural activities in the river basin
have resulted in heavy metals from pesticides and fertilizers
in water and soil. The three cases shown below have resided

A 16-year-old female presented with episodic ataxia, severe
fatigue, muscle twitching and difficultly concentrating.
Due to the severity of the symptoms, the patient stopped
attending high school. She has a past medical history that
includes a diagnosis of Lyme disease in 2002. Her mother
is a physician who has regularly assessed her daughter for
nutrient and toxicant levels as a part of a general wellness
protocol (A). Toxic metal screenings were normal until 2005,
when the onset of the symptoms symptoms noted above. An
elemental profile ordered on a urine specimen taken after
intravenous EDTA challenge revealed profoundly elevated
lead. (B). The exposure source was determined to be a
single water fountain at school from which the patient and
her friends regularly drank for three years. Her friends who
drank from the same fountain also reported experiencing
similar symptoms, most commonly associated with
compromised memory, concentration and fatigue.
Water testing revealed that their drinking fountain
lead levels greatly exceeded the EPA acceptable limit of
15 ppb (C). An investigation discovered that the water
fountain had been recalled by the manufacturer due to a
faulty refrigeration holding tank that was leaching lead
into the water.
The patient’s lead levels have slowly dropped over ensuing
years (D,E,F,), with whole blood lead returning to a normal
level in July 2007. Symptomatically, the patient continued to
struggled with her chief complaints through early 2007. The
