Introduction





How much an individual weighs and what makes up his or her body mass are the result of the interaction of unmodifiable factors such as age, sex, and heredity and the modifiable factors of energy intake and energy output. Given the concern over the increasing levels of overweight and obesity described in Chapter 7
, it is critical to understand these modifiable factors. Literally, hundreds of books and articles are written each year on these topics, often with exaggerated claims and untested suggestions. This chapter provides current scientific knowledge about body composition and weight control.




The Caloric Balance Equation




At its most basic level, weight control follows the first law of thermodynamics. The First Law of Thermodynamics
, sometimes called the Law of Conservation of Energy
, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but only changed in form. This law was described fully in Chapter 2
.





First Law of Thermodynamics or the Law of Conservation of Energy
 Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but only changed in form.



Kilocalorie
 The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C at 1 atmosphere.



Caloric Balance Equation
 The mathematical summation of the caloric intake (+) and energy expenditure (−) from all sources.





When the body converts the potential chemical energy of food into other chemical, mechanical, or heat energy, it follows the Law of Conservation of Energy. Theoretically, if the amount of energy taken in equals the amount of energy expended, the body is in balance and the weight (mass) remains stable. If an excess of energy is ingested, that energy is neither destroyed nor lost; rather, weight (mass) is gained. If insufficient energy is ingested in relation to expenditure, the needed energy cannot be created but must be provided from storage sites, and weight (mass) is reduced.




Energy, in the forms involved in the human body, is usually measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ). One
 kilocalorie
 is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C at 1 atmosphere. One kilocalorie is equal to 4.186 kJ. A calorie is equal to 0.001 kcal. Calorie with a capital C is equivalent to 1 kcal. To avoid confusion, this chapter always uses the unit kilocalorie, not calorie. The term calorie is often used generically, however, as in the statement “Caloric intake should be equal to caloric output,” even though the units would be kilocalories. The caloric equivalent of 1 lb of fat is 3,500 kcal.




The
 caloric balance equation
, the mathematical sum of the caloric intake (+) and energy expenditure (−) from all sources, quantifies the Law of Conservation of Energy. It describes the source of potential energy as the food ingested and the various uses of that energy. As indicated in
 
Figure 8.1

, input and output can be divided into the following components:










FIGURE 8.1
 Caloric Balance.
 Caloric balance is the mathematical sum of the caloric intake (+food and drink) and energy expenditure (−BMR/RMR, −thermogenesis, −exercise/work, −waste products).









Food (and fluid) intake represents the only positive factor in the caloric balance equation. It is the only way that energy can be added to the system (the body). Energy is expended primarily in three ways: the basal or resting metabolic rate, thermogenesis, and work or exercise. These are the primary negative factors in the caloric balance equation. Although also negative, the amount of energy excreted in waste products is insignificant, rarely measured, and need not be considered further here.





Figure 8.2

 indicates that the basal or resting metabolic rate accounts for most of the
 total energy expenditure
 (TEE), varying from approximately 60% to approximately 75% in active and sedentary individuals, respectively. Thermogenesis (the production of heat) accounts for a relatively stable 10% of caloric expenditure in both sedentary and active individuals. The energy expenditure of exercise is obviously higher in active individuals than sedentary ones and depends on the intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise.










FIGURE 8.2
 Energy Expenditure.
 Resting metabolic rate accounts for the largest percentage of energy expended in both inactive and active individuals, although the exact percentage varies between the two groups. The percentage of energy expended during exercise is higher in active than in inactive individuals. Thermogenesis accounts for about 10% of the energy expended in both active and inactive individuals.





If the amount of energy in the food ingested exceeds the energy expended, the body is in a positive balance and body weight will increase. If the amount of energy in the food ingested is less than the energy expended, the body is in a negative balance and body weight will decrease. Many adults self-regulate an amazingly constant body weight throughout the years despite the ingestion of literally hundreds of

 thousands of calories; others struggle with self-regulation and either lose or gain weight. In the pages that follow, each of the positive (food intake) and negative (basal metabolic rate [BMR], thermogenesis, and physical activity) components of the caloric balance equation will be defined and discussed. (The impact of diet, exercise, and exercise training on each of the components is systematically addressed and summarized in
 
Table 8.2

 at the end of the discussion.)



Food Ingested


The type and amount of food ingested are the result of many physiological, psychological, nutritional, behavioral, and sociological influences. It is not as simple as a physiological drive to balance energy demand and supply. People eat or do not eat for a variety of reasons. For example, when you are upset, do you cease eating, or do you consume everything in sight? Despite the diversity of influences, in this text, we will concentrate on the physiological controls.




Figure 8.3

 presents a schematic of the basic physiological factors involved in appetite control.
 
Tonic appetite

 signals

 arise from body composition and metabolic processes. Both fat-free mass and fat mass can impact resting metabolic rate (discussed later in detail).
 Leptin
, an appetite-suppressing (anorexigenic) hormone primarily secreted by adipose tissue, is part of a negative feedback loop regulating the size of energy stores and energy balance over the long term (2–4 days). The release of leptin signals satiety, decreases food intake, and increases energy expenditure.
 Insulin
 produced by the pancreas (islets of Langerhans) is involved in glucose use, protein synthesis, and the formation and storage of lipids. Leptin and insulin are tonic or long-term energy-regulating hormones that operate over days or weeks. The reaction of leptin and insulin may possibly be described as an inverted U response. That is, low and very high levels of these stimulate appetite and food intake and suppress energy expenditure, whereas more typical moderate levels are suppressive of appetite and food intake (

Hagobian and Braun, 2010

). Leptin’s main role is to protect against weight loss in times of nutritional deprivation (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016).










FIGURE 8.3
 Appetite Control.
 Appetite is controlled by both tonic (relatively stable over days) and episodic (varying during 1 day) signals originating in body tissues (fat-free mass and fat mass) and the gastrointestinal tract and operating through a variety of metabolic and hormonal signals that are coordinated in the brain. Acute exercise, chronic exercise training, and weight loss all impact the control of appetite. See text for details. Sources:
 Blundell et al. (2015); Greenway (2015); Shubert et al. (2014); Sumithran and Proietto (2013).





Episodic appetite signals
 regulate meal initiation (thus the frequency of meals) and termination (thus meal size). Ghrelin, particularly the acylated (active) form, is the main episodic appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) hormone. It is secreted primarily by endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Ghrelin is fast acting such that its levels increase before meals and decrease after meals and show additional daily variations (

Kalra et al., 2005

;
 
Klok et al., 2007

;
 
Popovic and Duntas, 2005

). In addition, a number of episodic peptides (amino acid compounds) such as cholecystokinin (CCK), pancreatic peptide (PP), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) function as appetite-inhibiting hormones. These hormones operate through specific areas in the hypothalamus (

Blundell et al., 2015

;
 
Shubert et al., 2014

).



The Impact of Diet on Food Intake


The term diet
 is used in many ways and often refers to the food regularly consumed during the course of normal living. It is also used to mean an intentional restriction of caloric intake. This second meaning is how the term is being used in this chapter. Therefore, “going on a diet,” by definition, means reducing food caloric intake.





Diet
 (1) The food regularly consumed during the course of normal living; (2) a restriction of caloric intake.




The Impact of Exercise on Appetite and Food Intake


The relationships among exercise, appetite, and energy intake are complex and often difficult to discern. Obviously, exercise involves the immediate expenditure of energy. Figure 8.3
 indicates what is currently known relative to the impact of an acute bout of exercise on tonic and episodic appetite signals. Insulin is the only tonic hormone impacted, and insulin decreases during exercise as part of the neurohormonal control of substrate utilization (Chapter 2
, Figure 2.17
). The major episodic appetite signals are modified in several ways: acylated ghrelin is decreased, while PP, GLP-1, and PYY are all increased. The result of these changes is a decrease in appetite stimulation by ghrelin and an increase in appetite suppression by the other three with the theoretical potential for a decrease in energy intake. To test if this theory occurs in practice requires the measurement of food intake. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to accurately measure food intake in free living humans. The act of feeding individuals in a controlled setting where food can be measured may cause changes in eating behavior. Asking individuals to write down everything they eat requires faith that they are neither overreporting nor (more likely) underreporting their consumption. For these reasons, conducting studies on the effects of exercise on appetite in humans is difficult. Despite the difficulties, the following generalizations can be drawn from available studies:



1.
 There is little to no effect of exercise on either appetite or energy intake within a single day or in the short term. An immediate transient decrease in appetite for 20–30 minutes after aerobic exercise at greater than 60%
 

 (but not resistance exercise) has been seen relatively consistently in both males and females, but not always. This is often termed “exercise-induced anorexia” (

Hagobian et al., 2013

;
 
Laan et al., 2010

). However, neither a reduction nor an increase in energy intake after the immediate transient decrease for up to 48 hours following a single bout of exercise has been clearly established (

Balaguera-Cortes et al., 2011

;
 
Blundell and King, 1999

;
 
Titchenal, 1988

;
 
Wilmore, 1983

). In one study, the subjective rating of appetite was lowered in female subjects following 30 minutes of exercise at 50%
 

. Despite this decreased subjective rating, food intake at the postexercise meal and for 2 days after was not affected. Other studies (

Maraki et al., 2005

;
 
Martins et al., 2007

;
 
Moore et al., 2004

;
 
Weigle et al., 2005

) have shown a decreased appetite during exercise, an increased appetite after exercise, and an increased energy intake at the next meal, but either no change or a decrease in total energy balance for the day. The dietary composition of the meals may impact which of these occurs before the next meal, as can be seen in the Focus on Research box (

Luscombe-Marsh et al., 2005

). When increased energy intake follows an exercise bout, it typically occurs only with heavy exercise, and the compensation is often incomplete. For example, when six young lean (BMI = 21.4 kg·m
−2
) females exercised moderately (2, 40-minute cycling sessions that burned 454 kcal), no significant increase occurred in daily energy intake above a no exercise condition. However, when the exercise was heavy (3, 40-minute cycling sessions that burned 812 kcal), energy intake increased but only compensated for approximately 30% of what had been expended, resulting in a negative energy balance (

Stubbs et al., 2002

). Another exception to the lack of an effect of exercise on appetite seems to occur in swimming, depending on water temperature. Energy intake has been shown to be as much as 44% higher after exercising in cold water (20°C) than in thermoneutral (33°C) water and 41%

 higher than under nonexercise conditions (

White et al., 2005

). A 2014 review found no effect of exercise on energy intake in 69% of 40 acute studies and 50% of 10 short-term studies (

Donnelly et al., 2014

).




2.
 An activity-induced negative energy balance can be tolerated without compensation for approximately 1–2 weeks. However, subsequently, food intake spontaneously increases and compensates for approximately 30% of the energy expended in exercise. Thus, this compensation is partial and remarkably similar to that seen after heavy exercise on the same day. Furthermore, individuals tend to be either compensators (as high as 60%) or noncompensators (as low as 0%), for unknown reasons (

Blundell et al., 2003

,
 
2015

). The difference may depend on the fitness and body composition status of the individual. Highly trained athletes and lean individuals usually increase their energy intake in response to increased training loads. Untrained and/or obese individuals often do not initially change energy intake in response to exercise training (

Drenowatz, 2015

;
 
Jokisch et al., 2012

).




3.
 The response of appetite to exercise is not sex specific. Although it has frequently been stated that there is a better matching between energy intake and expenditure in females than males, driven by the critical relationship between energy balance and reproductive success that does not operate in males and hence causes females to make up for expended energy by an increased energy intake, a careful analysis of the literature no longer supports this assertion (

Caudwell et al., 2014

). Hagobian et al. whose lab had previously shown that overweight/obese females were more likely to experience postexercise appetite stimulation compared to their male counterparts (

Hagobian et al., 2009

) has more recently (

Hagobian et al., 2013

) demonstrated experimentally that when males and females expended similar amounts of energy (30% of total daily energy expenditure) in acute exercise, there was no difference between the sexes in subjective appetite, appetite hormones, or energy expenditure. Relative energy intake postexercise was suppressed equally. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis revealed that the compensatory eating response to acute exercise was not different between the sexes (

Schubert et al., 2013

). Similarly, in another meta-analysis of data from 20 studies involving 241 participants (~78% male),
 
Schubert et al. (2014)

 reported small to moderate changes in acylated ghrelin (decreased) and three anorexigenic hormones (PYY, GLP-1, and PP, increased) that should suppress hunger with no statistical difference between males and females in ghrelin and PYY.



The Impact of Exercise Training on Appetite and Food Intake


Exercise-trained males experience appetite suppression immediately postexercise, but data are equivocal for exercise-trained females. An insufficient number of studies have investigated the influence of exercise training on appetite-regulating hormones and measures of appetite to definitively identify the adaptations in both males and females, normal-weight sedentary, and/or overweight/obese sedentary individuals (Howe et al., 2014
). However, the effect of exercise training will be mediated by changes in body composition in addition to the short-term changes brought about by each acute exercise session (Figure 8.3
). If training brings about an increase in fat-free mass, there will be an increase in early morning hunger and drive to eat. If training brings about a decrease in fat mass, there will be a decrease in leptin accompanied by increased satiety control. Thus, although overall energy intake may increase, there should be a better match of energy intake to energy expenditure (Blundell et al., 2015
; Bouassida et al., 2010
). This is seen in physically active males, females, adults, and children—such as heavy manual laborers and athletes who consume more calories than sedentary individuals yet generally maintain their body weight and composition at or below normal levels.



When chronic exercise training ceases, energy intake in humans is spontaneously reduced. Unfortunately, this reduction does not appear to be matched to the reduced energy expenditure. The result is often a positive energy balance, a regain of lost body weight, and a concomitant increase in body fat (

Blundell et al., 2003

;
 
Stubbs et al., 2004

).




Thus, it appears that the physiological factors that modify appetite/food intake in response to hunger or a deficit energy intake are more finely tuned or are more efficient than those factors that respond to satiety or an increase in energy intake. It has been speculated that this response to food may have been a survival of the species mechanism in days before modern agriculture provided more than enough food for much of the world (

Prentice and Jebb, 2004

). In other words, humans may have evolved to eat more than needed in times of plenty, in expectation of coming times of less food availability. Thus, it truly may be easier to gain weight than to lose weight.



Resting or Basal Metabolism


Basal energy expenditure, more commonly called basal metabolic rate (BMR)
, is the level of energy required to sustain the body’s vital functions in the waking state. Technically, this definition means that the individual is resting quietly in a supine position, not having eaten for 8–18 hours, is at normal body temperature (37°C) in a neutral ambient temperature (27–29°C; 80–84°F), and is not experiencing any psychological stress. Because of the difficulty of achieving truly basal conditions in laboratory
 settings, the term resting metabolic rate (RMR)
 is probably a more accurate descriptor. RMR is the energy expended while an individual is resting quietly in a supine position. These two terms are often used interchangeably, since the measured differences are small. That practice will be followed here, with the term RMR used primarily but not exclusively (Bursztein et al., 1989
).





Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
 The level of energy required to sustain the body’s vital functions in the waking state, when the individual is in a fasted condition, at normal body and room temperature, and without psychological stress.



Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)
 The energy expended while an individual is resting quietly in a supine position.





Many organs and processes are responsible for energy consumption at rest. The liver is the largest consumer of energy at rest (29–32%), followed by the brain (19–21%), muscles (18%), heart (10%), lungs (9%), and kidneys (7%). Resting muscle energy is primarily for the maintenance of tonus or tension, necessary even in sleep. On the cellular level, the energy is used to fuel ion pumps (particularly the sodium-potassium pump), synthesize and degrade cellular constituents, conduct electrical impulses, and secrete various substances, including hormones (

Bogert et al., 1973

;
 
Bursztein et al., 1989

).




Basal or resting metabolism is usually determined in relation to body surface area (BSA) and expressed in kcal·m
−2
. It may also be expressed in kcal·d
−1
 or
 

. The choice of measurement unit depends on how the information will be used. To compare with submaximal or maximal oxygen values, the choice is
 

. To express caloric needs, the kilocalorie unit is used. The most common way to calculate BMR/RMR is the use of prediction equations such as those presented in
 
Table 8.1

.

 Estimation of Basal (Resting) Metabolic Rate








HT, height (in centimeters); WT, weight (in kilograms); AGE, age (in years).

Eighty-five percent of all normal subjects have estimated RMR values within 10% of their measured values. The other 15% of the population have either higher or lower values. The range of variation may exceed 20%. Thus, an individual with an RMR 20% higher than average can ingest more calories without gaining weight, but an individual with a 20% lower RMR must ingest less or gain weight (

Bursztein et al., 1989

;
 
Guyton and Hall, 2016

).




Two criterion measures are available for RMR. The first is open-circuit indirect calorimetry, described in
 
Chapter 4

. The second is a blood test for the determination of protein-bound iodine. The iodine comes from thyroxine (T4), the hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, which has the greatest impact on BMR. This test gives a relative indication of BMR, not a direct kcal·d
−1
 value (

Bogert et al., 1973

).




The prediction equations in
 
Table 8.1

 give an indication of the primary nonhormonal factors that influence RMR. What are they? If you said body size, age, and sex, you are correct. RMR is related strongly to BSA externally and to cell mass internally, so, of course, what that cell mass is composed of (fat or muscle) will have an influence. Obese individuals have a larger surface area and a larger cell mass (both fat and fat-free) than average-weight individuals. Therefore, not surprisingly, the RMR of obese individuals is higher than that of normal-weight individuals (

Jequier, 1987

). The linear relationship between RMR and fat-free mass is identical in obese and lean people. However, although FFM and FM are good predictors of RMR, they account for only about 70% of RMR variability between individuals. Some of the residual RMR variation may be due to differences in organ mass (

Hall, 2012

).




The influence of age and sex can be seen in
 
Figure 8.4

. RMR is highest in infants and young children. The decline from age 6 to 18 is approximately 25%, or 2% per year. The decline then slows to about 2–3% per decade after that age. Part of this decline in RMR may be attributed to and be responsible for the increment in %BF that usually occurs as people age.










FIGURE 8.4
 Standard Basal Metabolic Rate across the Age Span.
 Standard basal metabolic rates decline steeply during childhood and adolescence and then more gradually during the adult years. At every age, male values are higher than female values, despite being prorated to body surface area. Sources:
 Calculated from Brownell et al. (1987)
; Bursztein et al. (1989)
.






Figure 8.4

 also clearly shows that, at all ages, average-weight females have lower RMR than average-weight males. The difference, which is least in young children, is accentuated at puberty and then tends to remain at about 5–6% through middle age and old age. In terms of calories, the RMR of adult males averages between 1,500 and 1,800 kcal·d
−1
, and the RMR of adult females averages between 1,200 and 1,450 kcal·d
−1
. Female values are lower partially because females have smaller internal organs than males and tend to have less total body mass, on average, than males. However, the most obvious explanation is the difference in body cell mass, particularly muscle tissue. Females on average have a higher %BF than do males. At

 any body weight, for each 1% increase in percent body fat, the RMR decreases 0.6 kcal·hr
−1
 or 14.4 kcal·d
−1
. If we assume a 10% difference in %BF between the average male and average female, the result can amount to 144 kcal·d
−1
. When RMR is expressed relative to fat-free weight (FFW), the sex differences disappear (

Bogert et al., 1973

;
 
Bursztein et al., 1989

).




Another factor that influences RMR is core body temperature. For each degree increase in Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature, metabolic rate increases to 13% or 7.2%, respectively. This holds true even when the core temperature increases due to acute illness (pyrogenesis). Similarly, a decrease in body temperature, at least until the point where shivering is induced, reduces energy expenditure.



The Impact of Diet on Resting Metabolic Rate


Both the amount and the type of food ingested affect RMR. The effect of caloric restriction on RMR is well documented and clear-cut. Severe caloric restriction decreases RMR possibly as much as 10–20% after several weeks (Apfelbaum et al., 1971
; Bray, 1969
; Brownell et al., 1987
; Grande et al., 1958a
; Mole et al., 1989
; Stiegler and Cunliffe, 2006
). This is shown experimentally in the Focus on Research box where RMR decreased approximately 80 kcal·d−1
, regardless of the composition of the diet (Luscombe-Marsh et al., 2005
). Because resting metabolism represents the greatest percentage of daily caloric expenditure in sedentary individuals, the discouraging result is a slowing of the weight loss that would be expected from the amount of dietary restriction and negative balance if the 3,500-kcal·lb-1
 rule of thumb is used and the expectation is that the only change that occurs is a loss of body fat.






Example






1 lb (0.45 kg) of body fat contains the energy equivalent of approximately 3,500 kcal. If an individual expends 2,000 kcal·d−1
 and ingests 2,000 kcal·d−1
, weight should be maintained. If that same individual maintains this activity level but reduces his/her caloric intake to just 1,000 kcal·d−1
, a weight loss of 2 lb·wk−1
 would be anticipated (2,000 kcal·d−1
 − 1,000 kcal·d−1
 = −1,000 kcal·d−1
; −1,000 kcal·d−1
 × 7 d·wk−1
 = −7,000 kcal; −7,000 kcal ÷ 3,500 kcal = −2 lb), assuming that approximately 75% of the 2,000 kcal·d−1
 expenditure or 1,500 kcal·d−1
 is expended by RMR.







However, within 2–3 weeks of such a restricted diet, the RMR will have been reduced by approximately 15% (the range is typically 10–20%) to 1,275 kcal·d
−1
. The difference is now −1,775 kcal·d
−1
 expended + 1,000 kcal·d
−1
 ingested = −775 kcal·d
−1
; −775 kcal·d
−1
 × 7 d·wk
−1
 = −5,425 kcal; −5,425 kcal ÷ 3,500 kcal·lb
−1
 = − 1.5 lb instead of −2 lb·wk
−1
. As the drop in RMR continues with severe caloric restriction, the weight loss becomes progressively slower (

Mole et al., 1989

).








Researchers speculate that this decline in RMR is the body’s protective response to energy restriction (

Speakman and Selman, 2003

). Conversely, a short-term excessive ingestion of food and calories results in an elevation of RMR (

Apfelbaum et al., 1971

;
 
van Zant, 1992

). This elevation has been seen as protection against an increase in the body’s “natural” weight (

Brownell et al., 1987

).




Maintenance of a “natural” weight or body composition is often attributed to an individual’s genetically determined set point. According to the
 setpoint theory
, changes in body mass or fat content are perceived in the periphery and appropriate signals sent to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus integrates and interprets the incoming feedback and in turn sends out signals that modify food intake or energy expenditure (including but not limited to RMR) to correct any deviations in weight or fat from the set point. The existence of a set point for homeostatic control of human body weight/fat is uncertain and under debate. At the very least, a set point cannot be a fixed permanent value, as it is necessary to allow for such things as growth and development. It may be that the set point actually functions as a “settling point” with new levels set after continuous demands on the outer limits of the acceptable range. These demands may arise from a variety of influences including overfeeding or underfeeding without changes in activity level (

Harris, 1990

;
 
Macias, 2004

).



The Impact of Exercise on Resting Metabolic Rate


The energy cost of exercise (Figure 8.5
), in oxygen or calorie units, includes a resting component. Metabolic equivalents (METs) (Chapter 4
) express the energy cost of activity in multiples of the RMR. Therefore, although metabolism is definitely elevated by exercise, it is not the resting metabolism itself that is elevated. The resting metabolism is assumed to remain constant; the increase in energy consumption is attributed solely to the activity demands and responses.









FIGURE 8.5
 Exercise Is an Important Component of Body Weight/Body Composition Control.





Immediately after exercise, the metabolic rate remains elevated. This rate is called the excess postexercise oxygen

 consumption (EPOC) and is discussed in
 
Chapter 3

. This recovery oxygen utilization represents additional calories that are expended as a direct result of the response to exercise. These calories are typically not included in the measured caloric cost of the activity. Thus, if an individual expends 250–300 kcal walking or jogging 3 mi, an extra 20–30 kcal may be expended during the hour or two after exercise until complete recovery occurs. Additionally, a slow component that may last up to 48 hours expends even more calories (

Speakman and Selman, 2003

). These expenditures, however, also do not mean that the RMR itself has been affected.




For it to be concluded that the resting metabolism is changed by exercise, the change would have to be evident 24 or 48 hours after exercise. Research evidence for such a change is mixed and difficult to interpret. The inconsistency of the evidence can partially be attributed to the intensity and duration of the exercise involved. Mild to heavy exercise of moderate duration (35–86%
 

 for 20–80 minutes) has generally been shown to cause no long-term metabolic elevation in RMR, whereas longer, moderate exercise (50–70%
 

; 80–180 minutes) has.




There is a problem, however, in interpreting metabolic changes greater than 48 hours after exercise as being caused by the exercise. Studies showing an increase in RMR over the long term, even after heavy exercise, have not controlled for the ingestion of food during the intervening 48 hours. The elevated metabolism observed was probably due, at least in part, to the thermic effect of the meals taken. (The TEM will be fully explained later in this chapter.) Consequently, it is unlikely that exercise causes any permanent change in RMR per se—at least not light or moderate aerobic endurance exercise or dynamic resistance activity (

Bingham et al., 1989

;
 
Horton, 1985

;
 
Melby et al., 1993

;
 
Stiegler and Cunliffe, 2006

).



The Impact of Exercise Training on Resting Metabolic Rate


The effect of exercise training on RMR is controversial. Results of cross-sectional studies involving RMR and training/fitness status have reported higher, lower, or the same values between trained-untrained and high fit-low fit groups. Similarly, training studies have produced inconsistent results ranging from an increase, to no change, to a decrease. One recent study (Lee et al., 2009
) found that after a 12-week treadmill jogging/running program, the RMR of the training group stayed the same, but that of the control group decreased. They concluded that the training program may have prevented a seasonal decline (RMR is highest in winter and lowest in summer) in the training group.



A significant, direct rectilinear relationship has been shown between the level of training or fitness as measured by
 

 and RMR (

Sullo et al., 2004

). Thus, one reason why some studies have not revealed differences between trained and untrained individuals may be that the trained individuals were simply not trained enough. In these studies, neither the trained nor the untrained individuals were restricted calorically. Therefore, what is occurring may be a last-bout effect by those training at high levels (

Melby et al., 1993

). Or it may be that a high-energy flux (heavy training volume with caloric balance) is the cause. Individuals in a high-energy flux condition have shown higher levels of norepinephrine and RMR than when they were in a state of low-energy flux (sedentary but in caloric balance) (

Bullough et al., 1995

).

Macronutrient Impact on Appetite and Thermic Effect of a Meal during Caloric Restriction






Fifty-seven individuals, aged 20–65 years, with BMI values between 27 and 40 kg·m−2
, completed 12 weeks of caloric restriction and 4 weeks of maintenance. The purpose was to determine the effects of two calorically equal diets that differed in protein and fat content on weight loss, appetite regulation, and the thermic effect of test meals. The low-fat, high-protein (LF-HP) diet consisted of 29% fat, 34% protein, and 37% carbohydrate. The high-fat, standard-protein (HF-SP) diet consisted of 45% fat (~29% monounsaturated), 18% protein, and 37% carbohydrate. Caloric intake was set at approximately 1,400 kcal·d−1
 for both groups during weight loss and at energy balance during maintenance.







Hunger, fullness, satiety, desire to eat, and the amount of food desired were measured before and at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the test meal. Participants desired less to eat after the LF-HP meal than after the HF-SP meal both before and after the 16 weeks of dieting and maintenance. This indicates a greater satiety with a high-protein content despite equal total calories.








Total body weight loss, total fat mass loss, and abdominal fat mass loss are shown in the accompanying graph (A). The males lost more in each category than the females; however, there was no significant difference between the diet groups. This is consistent with the conclusion of most caloric restriction studies. That is, it is the energy intake and not macronutrient composition that primarily determines total weight and fat loss.








The differences in energy expenditure are presented in graphs B and C. The decrease in RMR (B) was not significantly different between diet groups. However, the decrease in the thermic effect of a meal (TEM) with weight loss (C) was smaller in the LF-HP groups than in the HF-SP group. The authors concluded that although over the short term of the study this difference did not appear to enhance weight loss, it might have some small effect on weight maintenance later.








Thus, a high-protein diet, still within the recommended level of 10–35%, had the advantage over a high monounsaturated fat diet of blunting both the appetite and the dietary-induced decrease in the TEM.

Longitudinal studies investigating the impact of exercise training on RMR often add the exercise component after several weeks of severe caloric restriction in an attempt to reverse the decline in RMR. Others simply examine the impact of training on RMR during a calorically balanced state. High-intensity programs performed daily have not only brought about a return to baseline in RMR but also, in some instances, caused an elevation of 7–10%. In those studies showing a reversal of the decline in RMR, the change began within just a few days, which is well before any change would be expected in body composition. Thus, the conclusion again is that the effect of training on RMR is over and above any change in muscle mass. The increases in RMR above pretraining levels in nondieting individuals could also reflect increased norepinephrine levels (

Brownell et al., 1987

;
 
Mole et al., 1989

;
 
Nieman et al., 1988

).




In those studies showing an additional decline in RMR when exercise was added to caloric restriction, the decline is often explained as part of the body’s protective mechanism. If RMR declines when calories are restricted, burning additional calories in activity simply makes matters worse. Therefore, it is logical that the RMR would decrease even further. It has been suggested that this decline occurs in individuals (such as some athletes) who are attempting to maintain body weights below their natural level (

Brownell et al., 1987

).




If diet and/or exercise results in a loss of body weight (mass), then a proportional long-term reduction in RMR should be expected. Despite the claims of many overweight individuals to the contrary, overweight or obese people typically have a higher RMR than normal-weight individuals of similar age, sex, and height to begin with. With weight loss, this higher RMR should not be expected to be maintained (

Garrow, 1987

;
 
Stiegler and Cunliffe, 2006

;
 
Wadden et al., 1990

).





Byrne et al. (2012)

 attempted to determine to what extent changes in RMR and body composition explained the less-than-expected weight loss in obese men and women participating in concurrent (16-week) severe dietary restriction (energy intake = 564–650 kcal·d
−1
) and exercise training (aerobic plus resistance). The relative energy deficit from baseline was 74–87%. Measured weight loss averaged 67% of the predicted value but ranged from 39% to 94%. Changes in RMR explained on average 67% of the less-than-expected weight loss and variability in the proportion of weight lost as fat mass accounted for 5% more. Only when adjusted for these changes in RMR and fat mass did the actual weight loss attain 90% of predicted values

.




Because RMR is highly correlated with or related to FFW, but not entirely dependent on it, it might be expected that resistance weight training would bring about an increase in RMR. Again, the data are not definitive. Perhaps the most impressive evidence for this idea comes from a study with males 50–65 years old. After 16 weeks of heavy resistance strength training, these subjects had no change in total body weight but showed a decrease in %BF, an increase in FFW, and an increase in RMR. This increase in RMR remained significant even when expressed per kilogram of FFW. Resting norepinephrine levels also increased. The researchers concluded that the increase in RMR with strength training was only partially due to the increased FFW and may also have been linked to an increase in basal sympathetic nervous system activity (

Pratley et al., 1994

). This conclusion reinforces the idea that RMR does not totally depend on muscle mass.




A 24-week strength training study resulted in significant increases in RMR in young and old males, but not in females, perhaps reflecting sex differences in sympathetic nervous activity (

Lemmer et al., 2001

). Conversely,

 a 9-week study by
 
Byrne and Wilmore (2001)

 found that both FFW and RMR (measured 72 hours after the last exercise session) increased in resistance-trained females. A second group who did a combination of aerobic endurance and resistance weight training increased their FFW equally, but their RMR decreased. The control group did not change significantly. When RMR was expressed relative to FFW, there was no significant change in the resistance-trained individuals (indicating that all the increase in RMR could be attributed to changes in FFW for this group), but there was an even greater decrease for the combined training group. The reasons for the decline in RMR are unclear. As noted above, this may simply be a compensatory response to an exercise program that is too intensive.




The amount of decline in resting metabolic rate is highest with diet alone, intermediate with a combination of diet and exercise, and least with exercise alone (

Tremblay et al., 2013

).



Thermogenesis


Think about this. The temperature is 38°C (100°F) with a relative humidity of 80%. Your apartment air conditioner is not working. You are hungry but cannot afford to eat out. In your food stock are ground beef, red beans and rice, tuna, and the ingredients for a fruit salad and a tossed salad. Which do you select? In all probability you will pick one or both of the salad options, intuitively choosing a meal you assume will not add to your heat load. Actually, though, following ingestion of any meal, metabolism is elevated.



The production of heat is called
 thermogenesis
. Heat production is associated with physical activity/exercise (EAT = exercise-associated thermogenesis) and nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). Thermogenesis also occurs in response to cold (
cold-induced thermogenesis
). When a mammal is exposed to cold, it first attempts to preserve body heat by vasoconstriction, piloerection, and/or postural changes to decrease exposed body surface area. If that is insufficient, endogenous heat production is increased by
 shivering thermogenesis
 (nonproductive muscular twitches). After a prolonged period in the cold, shivering ceases but a high metabolic rate continues. This is termed
 nonshivering thermogenesis
. Finally, thermogenesis is associated with the ingestion of food (

Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011

).






Thermogenesis
 The production of heat.



Thermic Effect of a Meal (TEM)
 The increased heat production as a result of food ingestion.



Adaptive Thermogenesis
 Any change in heat production or energy expenditure in response to a changing internal or external environment indicating either an increase or decrease in the efficiency of energy utilization.





The increased heat production as a result of ingesting a meal, such as seen in
 
Figure 8.6

, is called the
 thermic effect of a meal (TEM)
 or
 dietary-induced thermogenesis (DIT)
. TEM has two components: obligatory and facultative.
 Obligatory
 thermogenesis is due to the energy-requiring processes of digestion, absorption, assimilation, and synthesis of protein, fat, and carbohydrate. However, more energy is expended than can be accounted for by these processes. The extra energy expenditure is the
 facultative
 portion of TEM. Facultative thermogenesis usually peaks in 30–90 minutes but, depending on the size and content of the meal, may last as long as 4–6 hours. This energy all appears in the form of heat and has been attributed to sympathetic nervous system activity (

Acheson et al., 1984

;
 
Blanchard, 1982

;
 
Dulloo et al., 2004

). Convincing evidence is available for sympathetic activation after carbohydrate-rich meals, but similar evidence is currently lacking after protein and fat ingestion (

van Baak, 2008

). Cumulatively, the energy expenditure associated with the ingestion of all food during a day is called the
 thermic effect of feeding (TEF)
. TEF is what is depicted as thermogenesis in
 
Figure 8.1

 as constituting approximately 10% of daily energy expenditure (

Blanchard, 1982

;
 
van Baak, 2008

).










FIGURE 8.6
 The Thermic Effect of a Meal.
 The thermic effect of a meal is dependent upon the macronutrient content and total kilocalories ingested.





Dietary-induced and nonshivering thermogenesis may occur as a result of the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. That is, energy substrates are oxidized but ATP is not produced. Instead, heat is produced. This process may occur at specific steps in the metabolic pathways (known as substrate or futile cycling) or in brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria (

Himms-Hagen, 1984

;
 
van Baak, 2008

) (see
 
Figure 7.11

). The high number of iron-containing mitochondria in these adipose cells is the origin of their brown designation. The energy substrates may be the lipid droplets stored within the BAT cells or from circulating glucose and lipid. Brown adipose cells originate from precursor cells that can also differentiate to skeletal muscle cells (

Sidossis and Kajimura, 2015

;
 
Wu et al., 2013

). They contain a protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In uncoupling, the influx of H
+
 ions into the matrix of the mitochondrion from the intermembrane space (

Chapter 2

,
 
Figure 2.10

) bypasses the ATP synthase ball and stalk apparatus in electron transport and instead moves through the UCP1, releasing

 heat but not producing any ATP (

Cohen and Spiegelman, 2015

). BAT appears to be under adrenergic sympathetic nervous control (specifically norepinephrine) and leptin may play a role. Increasing insulin levels after eating may be responsible for dietary-induced thermogenesis. Conditions such as cold exposure or overfeeding increase norepinephrine activity in BAT. Adaptation can occur in cold-induced thermogenesis and diet-induced thermogenesis (

Lee et al., 2014

).




The term
 adaptive thermogenesis
 is not unequivocally defined but has come to mean any change in heat production or energy expenditure in response to a changing internal or external environment indicating either an increase or decrease in the efficiency of energy utilization. In the context of dietary-induced thermogenesis, an
 adaptive increase in thermogenesis
 indicates a change in the efficiency of energy utilization resulting in increased heat production preventing the storage of energy. Reduction of adaptive thermogenesis can be interpreted as a defensive, body mass–saving mechanism after underfeeding (

Erlanson-Albertsson, 2003

;
 
Mozo et al., 2005

;
 
Müller and Bosy-Westphal, 2013

;
 
Wijers et al., 2008

).




Until very recently, it had been thought that only human newborns had any BAT. It has now been demonstrated that substantial amounts of metabolically active BAT are present in healthy adult humans. The main BAT depots are in the neck and shoulder region of the upper torso, along the vertebrae, in the thoracic cavity, and around the renal glands. All individuals do not exhibit defined regions of functionally active BAT. BAT prevalence and activity are higher in young, lean individuals than older, obese individuals (

Betz and Enerbäck, 2015

;
 
Lee et al., 2013; Vertanen, 2014

).




To complicate things even more, in 2012, an additional variation of adipocyte cell was identified. It appears that white adipose tissue may be “browned” becoming “
brite
” (brown-in-white) or
 beige
 adipose tissue. Beige adipose cells (see Figure 7.11) arise from the same precursor cells as white adipose cells and reside sporadically with white subcutaneous adipose cells emerging in response to certain environmental cues such as temperature (cold), exercise, endocrine hormones (including GLP-1,
 
Figure 8.3

), metabolites (including lactate and the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate), and nutrition. However, they are, like BAT, thermogenic and utilize substrates to produce heat not ATP. Humans have both classic BAT and beige cells. That is, a large portion of adult human brown fat is not classic BAT but actually beige fat. In adults, the depth of fat in the neck seems to be a determinant of relative amounts of brown versus beige fat; that is, classic BAT is more abundant in deeper neck locations. Because brown fat cells of all types can dissipate stored chemical energy as heat, there is optimism that strategies targeting human BAT/beige fat induction and activation will eventually help to prevent weight gains, assist weight loss, maintain weight, prevent against the complications of obesity such as fatty liver and cardiovascular disease, improve glucose homeostasis in diabetes, and enhance overall metabolic, bone, and skeletal muscle health. Whether these potential therapeutic benefits can be achieved at all and, if so, be achieved by cold exposure or pharmaceuticals remains to be seen (

Betz and Enerbäck, 2015

Sharp et al., 2012

;
 
Sidossis and Kajimura, 2015

;
 
Wu et al., 2013

).




The relationship between BAT and/or beige fat and dietary-induced thermogenesis in humans has not been firmly established. However, a study involving 19 healthy males participants (11 BAT positive and 8 BAT negative) revealed that after the ingestion of a 500-kcal test meal, postprandial energy expenditure increased more in the BAT
+
 than the BAT
-
 group (

Saito et al., 2011

). A rigorously controlled 2014 study (Lee et al.) provided evidence linking BAT activity to overnight temperature exposure (1 month each at 24°C vs. 19°C) and its metabolic consequences. In 5 young normal-weight males, after cold acclimation, BAT volume and overall fat metabolic activity increased by 42% and 10%, respectively. Dietary-induced thermogenesis was increased by 32%. These changes were accompanied by enhanced postprandial insulin sensitivity, an increase in thyroid hormone T3-to-T4 ratio, an elevation in adiponectin (a strong insulin sensitizer), and a reciprocal reduction in leptin.




Most studies comparing the thermic response of lean and obese individuals to a test meal show a blunted TEM in the obese (

Blanchard, 1982

;
 
de Jonge and Bray, 2002

;
 
Jequier, 1987

;
 
Segal et al., 1984

,
 
1985

,
 
1987

).



The Impact of Diet on the Thermic Effect of a Meal


Both the total caloric content and the percent composition of a meal impact the thermic effect of the meal. The thermic effect of the macronutrients, as a percentage of their energy content, is 2–3% for fat, 6–8% for carbohydrate, and 25–30% for protein (Jequier, 2002
). These differences seem to suggest that a high-protein diet would be valuable for individuals wishing to expend extra calories. Indeed, the study (Luscombe-Marsh et al., 2005
) presented in the Focus on Research box earlier bears this out partially. Although both the group eating a high monounsaturated fat, standard-protein diet and the group eating a low-fat, high-protein diet exhibited a decrease in the thermic response to a standard meal, the decrease with weight loss was smaller in the group on the high-protein diet. However, the total weight loss did not differ between the groups. The authors suggested that this difference could be
 beneficial in maintenance of the weight loss, but it was not experimentally tested.



If the percentages of protein, fat, and carbohydrate are kept constant and close to those values recommended for a healthy diet, a direct relationship is found between the caloric content of a meal and TEM; that is, higher caloric meals cause a higher thermic effect. As a result, an individual on a restricted caloric diet will burn fewer calories through dietary-induced thermogenesis than when eating larger meals (

Belko et al., 1986

;
 
Bursztein et al., 1989

).



The Impact of Exercise on the Thermic Effect of a Meal


Both meal ingestion and exercise stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and thermogenesis. Because many people wish to maximize energy expenditure, researchers have tried to determine whether a combination of exercise plus a meal in close temporal proximity would potentiate (or increase) the singular effect of either exercise or food. A number of studies have been completed following two basic sequences. After a period of rest, the subjects eat a meal and then exercise. Or conversely, after a period of rest, the subjects exercise and then eat a meal. In both sequences, some studies have shown that TEM was enhanced due to exercise (Belko et al., 1986
; Denzer and Young, 2003
; Segal et al., 1984
, 1985
, 1987
; Zahorska-Markiewicz, 1980
), while others have shown that TEM was not enhanced due to exercise (Dallasso and James, 1984
; Pacy et al., 1985
; Welle, 1984
; Willms and Plowman, 1991
). The studies have been so diverse in terms of subjects, meal composition and energy value, exercise mode, intensity, and duration, however, that it is impossible to determine a pattern for when the effect is additive and when it is not.


The Impact of Exercise Training on the Thermic Effect of a Meal


Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating the effects of training have shown that aerobic-trained individuals have a larger (Davis et al., 1983
; Hill et al., 1984
; Lundholm et al., 1986
), smaller (LeBlanc et al., 1984a
, 1984b
; Tremblay et al., 1983
, 1985
), or similar (Owen et al., 1986
; Ratcliff et al., 2011
) TEM response. As in the studies dealing with the acute effects of exercise, these studies involve a wide diversity of subjects (especially in training level), meal composition, and meal energy value. The reasons for these inconsistent findings are presently unknown (Sullo et al., 2004
). However, there does appear to be a relationship between 

 and TEF (Davis et al., 1983
; Hill et al., 1984
; LeBlanc et al., 1984b
; Tagliaferro et al., 1986
) although whether this is positive or negative may depend on where (high or low) along the continuum of aerobic fitness one falls.



As with aerobic endurance training, study results using resistance-trained individuals are inconsistent. One study compared individuals with similar
 

 values within the range of the moderately fit just cited [resistance trained (52 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) and untrained (51.1 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
)] and found that the untrained subjects had a significantly higher TEM than the resistance trained (

Gilbert et al., 1991

). A second study compared the response of resistance-trained and sedentary individuals to a high-carbohydrate (79%) versus moderate-fat (45%), similar protein (18–20%) meal. The resistance-trained individuals had a higher TEM in reaction to the high-CHO meal, but there was no significant difference in response between groups to the moderate-fat meal (

Thyfault et al., 2004

). Still, a third study (

Ratcliff et al., 2011

) found no difference between the TEM in resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and sedentary individuals although there were differences between groups in response to whether the meal was liquid or solid. Obviously, the impact of training on the TEM has yet to be determined.



Exercise/Activity Energy Expenditure


The last element in the caloric balance equation is the amount of energy expended in manual work or exercise (Figure 8.7
). Restricting calories does not change the
 energy expended in any activity except as it influences body weight/body composition (Ghiani et al., 2015
). However, individuals on calorically restrictive diets may have insufficient energy and may not be able to do as much physical work or exercise (Westerterp, 2003
).









FIGURE 8.7
 Energy Expended in Manual Labor Is an Important Component of Total Energy Expenditure.





By definition, exercise increases energy expenditure and the effects of training are cumulative. Unless efficiency and/or body weight changes, the caloric expenditure of any activity does not change with exercise training.





Table 8.2

 summarizes the impact of diet, exercise, and exercise training on all of the elements of the caloric balance equation.

 Impact of Diet, Exercise, and Exercise Training on the Caloric Balance Equation








The Effects of Diet, Exercise Training, and Diet Plus Exercise Training on Body Composition and Weight




Many people wish to lose weight strictly for aesthetic reasons (to look better) without caring where this weight comes from. From a physiological standpoint, however, there are four goals for weight loss:



1.
 To lose body fat with special consideration to visceral abdominal fat




2.
 To preserve fat-free weight (FFW)




3.
 To maintain or improve health




4.
 To maintain or improve performance in athletes




Many factors influence whether these goals can be and are met, including the following:




1.
 The initial status of the individual (Is he or she a few pounds overweight or obese?)




2.
 The type of diet selected (Is the caloric restriction minimal, moderate, severe, or maximal? What percentages of the basic nutrients are included in the diet?)




3.
 The duration of the weight-reducing program (24–48 hours, 5–20 weeks, or longer)




4.
 Whether or not exercise training is included as part of the program, and if so, the amount and type of exercise (dynamic aerobic endurance, weight-bearing or non–weight-bearing, or dynamic resistance training)




The
 
American College of Sports Medicine (2001)

 recommends that adults with a BMI ≥ 25 kg·m
−2
 consider reducing their body weight, especially if their waist circumference indicates an excess of visceral abdominal fat. Adults with a BMI of ≥30 kg·m
−2
 are encouraged to seek weight loss assistance. The Obesity Evaluation and Treatment Expert Committee (

Barlow and Dietz, 2007

) recommends that children aged 2–7 years with a BMI in the 85th–94th percentile range according to the CDC growth charts (

Chapter 7

;
 
Figure 7.8A

 and
 
B

) and those greater than the 95th percentile without health complications maintain their weight. Weight loss is recommended for children above the 95th percentile with health complications. Children and adolescents over the age of 7 years with a BMI in the 85th–94th percentile range and no health complications are advised to maintain their weight. Weight loss is recommended for children between the 85th and 94th percentile with health complications and for all individuals with a BMI above the 95th percentile. The following discussion is primarily intended for these individuals for whom weight loss is recommended.




Exact responses to all possible combinations of the above factors (initial status of the individual, type of diet selected, duration of the weight loss program, inclusion

 or exclusion of exercise, type of exercise program) are not available. But some generalizations can be made. Chief among them is that weight reduction requires that energy expenditure exceed dietary energy intake. Excluding surgical and pharmacological manipulations, this means diet restriction, exercise, or a combination of both. Separately and collectively, diet and exercise affect body composition and body weight.




Underlying recommendations for weight loss by diet alone, exercise alone, or a combination of the two is the general guideline that states that a cumulative energy deficit of 3,500 kcal is required to lose 1 pound of body weight. The origin of this guideline can be traced back to a calculation that assumes exclusive loss of adipose tissue consisting of 86–87% fat. One pound of fat (or anything else) is equal to 454 g. Each gram of fat contains 9 kcal of energy, thus 454 g × 9 kcal
·
g
-1
 = 4,219 kcal × 0.86 = 3,514 kcal (rounded to 3,500 kcal) per pound. The rest of the adipose cell is fluid and protein. However, when energy intake does not meet energy expenditure requirements, the deficit is made up for by the metabolism not only of body fat but also protein and glycogen, and in the process, large amounts of water are also lost. The metabolizable energy density of glycogen is 1,912 kcal per pound and of protein 2,140 kcal per pound. Water has no metabolizable energy content. Thus, the 3,500 kcal·lb
−1
 is an oversimplification as an energy deficiency prescription (

Hall, 2008

).




Furthermore, the 3,500 kcal per pound rule implies (1) that loss of weight will be at a constant rate depending only on the magnitude of the energy intake change, (2) that the energy expended by the body remains unchanged during this time, and (3) that the rate of change is the same regardless of an individual’s starting point in terms of body adiposity. However, a recent analysis demonstrates that the use of the 3,500 rule significantly overestimates the size of weight loss in practice. In an analysis of seven studies with 103 participants (sex, 71 M, 32 F; baseline body weight, 82.1 ± 22 kg; baseline caloric intake, 2,876 ± 484 kcal·d
−1
), an average deficit of 1,439 ± 784 kcal·d
−1
, and an average treatment duration of approximately 65 days (range 31–93 days), the majority of participants recorded substantially less weight loss than the amount predicted by the 3,500-kcal rule. The mathematically predicted weight loss was 27.6 ± 16 lb; participants lost 20.1 ±11.3 lb, that is, 7.4 lb less than expected (

Thomas et al., 2013

).




In point of fact, the energy expended by the body does not stay constant as an individual loses weight even if the physical activity level remains relatively constant (as was discussed in the section on resting metabolic rate), and weight change varies depending on initial body fat content. People with more initial fat involuntarily allocate a greater proportion of a net energy deficiency toward a loss of body fat than do people with lower initial fat. Lean tissue requires more energy to maintain and thus contributes more to the body’s overall energy expenditure (

Hall, 2008

,
 
2012

;
 
Hall et al., 2011

). However, everyone will lose some lean tissue (FFW). The fact that the 3,500-kcal·lb
−1
 rule does not function in an unwavering assumed linear fashion does not invalidate the caloric balance equation. The caloric balance equation simply functions dynamically as the body adapts to the induced changes of a caloric deficit (or excess). Despite these problems with the 3,500-kcal rule, much of the literature and many of the recommendations for weight control still rely on it and it cannot be totally avoided in the discussions to follow.

The Effects of Diet on Body Composition and Weight


The vast majority of individuals wanting to lose weight choose to diet. Caloric restriction may be minimal (a deficit of about 250–500 kcal·d−1
), moderate (a total intake of 1,200–1,500 kcal·d−1
), severe (a total intake of 400–800 kcal·d−1
), or maximal (fasting or zero caloric intake). Assuming adherence, all of these will result in a weight loss
.



With dietary restriction, the percentages of body fat and fat-free weight (FFW) will vary based on the caloric content of the diet. Thus, body weight loss from total fasting is split equally between body fat (50%) and FFW (50%); from very-low- (400–800 kcal·d
−1
) or low- (800–1,200 kcal·d
−1
) calorie diets, the split is approximately 75% body fat and 25% FFW and from 1,200 to 1,500 kcal·d
−1
 diets 90% body fat and only 10% FFW (

Nieman, 1990

). Fasting, which is obviously incompatible with life over the long haul, is not recommended as a dietary technique. Low-calorie and very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) should be undertaken only in extreme situations under the direct supervision of a physician. This technique is typically reserved for extremely obese individuals and is often conducted in a live-in metabolic ward of a hospital. VLCDs result in larger, more rapid reductions in weight, and weight maintenance may be greater with this technique. However, neither the long-term health effects nor the effects of the rate of weight loss on body composition or regional fat loss have been determined (

Volek et al., 2005

). The 1,200–1,500 kcal·d
−1
 regimen is often recommended, but even that does not totally preserve lean body mass (

ACSM, 1983

). Furthermore, it is better to individualize this approach to a reduction in energy intake of 500–1,000 kcal·d
−1
. With this level of energy deficit, a weight loss of approximately 1–2 lb (0.5–0.9 kg) per week is reasonable but not guaranteed given the discussion on the 3,500-kcal rule above. A faster rate of weight loss or more initial weight loss has not been shown to improve long-term weight loss compared with this conservative approach (

ACSM, 2001

). The importance of the FFW loss may depend on how much excess weight the individual started with. Obese individuals have an excess of both body fat and FFW; their excess body weight is composed of 62–78% fat and 22–38% FFW. The excess FFW is necessary to support and move their larger mass. Therefore, as one loses total body weight, less FFW is needed, and its loss therefore is neither unexpected nor particularly harmful. The loss of some FFW in such an individual may not be critical, but its preservation would also not be detrimental from a health standpoint. Individuals with less weight to lose need to protect their FFW more (

Brown et al., 1983

;
 
Donnelly et al., 1991

;
 
Jequier, 1987

;
 
Pacy et al., 1986

).




Unfortunately, body weight/composition changes by dietary restriction alone also bring about decreases in resting and nonresting energy expenditure, fat oxidation, thyroid hormones (all of which are associated with increased energy storage), total energy expenditure, and exercise energy expenditure. Factors that increase energy intake, namely, increased ghrelin, and decreases in leptin, PYY, insulin, and sympathetic nervous activity also occur (

Figure 8.3

). All of these may persist for up to a year post weight loss (

Washburn et al., 2014

).




Recall that FFW is composed of water, protein, and bone mineral (see
 
Figure 7.2

 in
 
Chapter 7

). Bone loss often accompanies weight loss brought about by caloric restriction alone (

McTigue et al., 2006

;
 
Villareal et al., 2006

). The key to maintaining bone density may be the intake of adequate or higher calcium (

Riedt et al., 2007

) or exercise to achieve the negative energy balance (

Villareal et al., 2006

).




The relative proportions of water and protein loss when dieting vary with the duration of the diet. During the first several days of a diet, most weight loss (55–70%) is water loss. But by the end of the first month, this percentage is considerably reduced (to ~40%), and after 7–8 months, it may be as low as 5%. The protein (primarily the component of muscle tissue) loss is a consistent 5% in a nonexercising dieter (

Grande et al., 1958a

;
 
Heymsfield et al., 1989

). What does this say about the proportion of fat loss? Simply that the percentage of fat loss is a mirror image of the percentage of water loss: little fat is lost at first and then progressively more fat is lost as caloric restriction continues. In terms of the 3,500 kcal·lb
−1
, because body water has no metabolizable energy content, early weight changes have an energy density substantially lower than this value (

Hall, 2012

).




Strangely enough, restricting water intake while dieting causes a higher proportion of water to be lost, not less, which could lead to dehydration. More total weight is lost if water is restricted, but not more fat. Water intake should not be restricted when dieting (

Grande et al., 1958b

;
 
Heymsfield et al., 1989

).



The Effects of Exercise Training on Body Composition and Weight


Little evidence suggests that exercise alone produces weight losses as great as what can be achieved with dietary modification alone. Results from short-term studies lasting ≤16 weeks have shown that increased physical activity is positively associated with a reduction in total fat in a dose-response relationship; that is, the more calories expended in exercise, the greater the fat loss. In long-term studies (≥ 26 weeks), however, no dose-response is seen. On average, the weight loss attained in short-term studies is approximately 85% of that expected (based on the 3,500 rule of caloric expenditure) and is composed almost entirely of fat. Research evidence does not support resistance exercise as effective for weight loss with or without dietary restriction (ACSM, 2009
). A 2014 meta-analysis (Washburn et al.) found greater long-term weight losses with diet compared to exercise (only ~3%) but attributed this to insufficient energy expenditure in the exercise trials. They concluded that “…clinically significant weight loss can be achieved with aerobic exercise alone when exercise energy deficits are similar in magnitude to those induced by energy restriction” (p. 30). The failure of exercise in some studies to produce weight losses similar to those induced by dietary control may also result from individuals compensating for the increased energy expenditure during exercise by decreasing energy expenditure the rest of the day (sometimes called nonexercise activity thermogenesis or NEAT), which again results in a lower-energy deficit than intended. The study presented in Figure 8.8
 reveals that NEAT changes actually do occur. Thirty-four overweight or obese females
 (age, 32 years; BMI, 29.3 kg·m−2
) exercised for 150 min·wk−1
 for 8 weeks expending a net
 total of 30.2 ± 12.6 MJ (7,724.7 ± 3,014.3 kcal) for a predicted fat loss of 0.8 ± 0.2 kg (1.76 ± 0.44 lb). Food intake was not controlled. For the group as a whole, no change in body fat mass occurred. However, there was a large individual variation. The range of fat loss can be seen in Figure 8.8A
. The 11 individuals who achieved more than the predicted fat loss were classified as “responders,” and the 23 individuals who achieved less than the predicted fat loss were classified as “nonresponders.” There were no significant differences in the energy intake or macronutrient percentages between responders and nonresponders. Responders increased their daily caloric intake by 0.86 ± 0.75 MJ (206 ± 179.4 kcal) and nonresponders by 1.03 ± 0.53 MJ (246 ± 126.8 kcal) per day. Figure 8.8B
 shows the changes in daily energy expended by responders and nonresponders categorized as total energy expenditure (TEE), activity energy expenditure (AEE, calculated as the energy expenditure of all active activities except the structured exercise sessions), sedentary energy expenditure (SEDEE), and sleeping energy expenditure (SEE). The only significant change was in the AEE with responders showing an increase of 0.79 ± 0.5 MJ (+189 kcal) and the nonresponders a decrease of 0.62 ± 0.39 MJ (−148.3 kcal). Given that both groups expended approximately the same amount of energy during exercise [28.55 MJ ± 2.14 (6,830 ± 523 kcal) responders; 30.29 ± 1.76 (7,246.3 ± 421 kcal) nonresponders] and increased their energy intake approximately equally, these data indicate that the lower-than-predicted fat mass loss in the “nonresponders” can be attributed, to some extent, to a compensatory reduction in physical activity outside the supervised exercise sessions.

When the energy deficit is held constant and other factors affecting energy balance are controlled, dynamic aerobic exercise can induce meaningful weight loss. Increases of less than 150 min·wk−1
 of exercise result in minimal weight loss. Exercise increases between 150 and 225 min·wk−1
 result in modest weight loss (~2–3 kg/4–7 lb), whereas 225–420 min·wk−1
 result in 5–7.5 kg (~11–17 lb) weight loss over months to years of activity. Obviously, there is a dose-response relationship operating in that higher doses can potentially provide larger losses from initial weight (ACSM, 2009
; Hansen et al., 2007
; Ross and Janssen, 2001
).



When energy expenditure is equal (in supervised studies where exercise energy expenditure is substantial), weight and fat loss are likely to be equal regardless of sex. There is some evidence (although not overwhelming) that suggests that lean females do not lose as much weight in response to exercise as lean males. However, in overweight/obese individuals, any differences in weight loss can be attributed to greater exercise-induced energy expenditure in the males rather than an increased compensatory energy intake in females regardless of the time span of the exercise training. When the exercise intervention is based on intensity and duration, larger individuals (typically males) will expend more energy. When the energy expenditure is controlled, measured, and the same for males and females, then similar changes in body weight and body fat are observed. There is, of course, a large individual variability in response to the same dose of exercise within the sexes so any given male or any given female may lose more or less weight or %BF than any other male or female (

Caudwell et al., 2014

).
 
Figure 8.9A

 shows the changes in anthropometric variable in 107 overweight and obese males and premenopausal females as the result of a 12-week aerobic exercise program in which the intensity was set at 70% HRmax and the duration individualized so that each participant expended 500 kcal each exercise session, 5 days per week. The intervention resulted in significant reductions in BMI, total body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), and waist circumference (WC). The mean reduction in %FM (−2.45%) was identical between males and females. A significant increase in absolute fat-free mass (FFM) was observed in the females but not males. However, when FFM was expressed as a percentage of BM, a significant and similar percentage of increase occurred (2.47% M; 2.50% F). Panel 8.9B shows the extreme interindividual variation in FM and FFM (

Caudwell et al., 2013

).

Realistically, few people wishing to lose body weight set out to do it entirely by exercising. You may encounter some of these people in health clubs, but they are a minority. On the other hand, there are many individuals who consciously or unconsciously do control their body weight through exercise training. These are, of course, athletes. If we ignore the fact that some athletes also closely watch their caloric intake, indirect evidence of the effect of exercise on body composition can be inferred from the %BF values measured in various groups of athletes.
 
Figure 8.10

 presents a compilation of sports.

Keeping in mind that the %BF for an average young adult male should be 12–15% and that for a young adult female it is 22–25%, several conclusions can be made from this graph. First, even among athletes, the male-female difference in %BF is maintained. Second, male and female athletes in different sports vary considerably in their %BF, from much leaner than average to slightly above average. Third, the %BF values appear to have a direct relationship to the demands of the sport. Athletes in sports where body aesthetics play a part in success (dance, figure skating, bodybuilding, and gymnastics) tend to have low %BF values. Endurance athletes (cyclists, cross-country skiers, distance runners, and triathletes) also tend to have low %BF values. Athletes in predominantly motor skill sports (baseball, golf, and volleyball) tend to be about average. The only athletes consistently at or above average %BF values are the field event participants.



These data tend to support the value of exercise training in maintaining a low %BF, because athletes in activities known to have high caloric costs and engaged in for long periods of time have the lowest %BF. However, the problem of self-selection is present in studies of this type; that is, we do not know whether individuals who are genetically programmed for leanness and success in these sports naturally gravitate to them or whether the training demands of the sport determine the body composition of the performer. Both factors are probably operating.




Although the mean values in this graph show a definite pattern, a wide range of variability exists among successful athletes in any given event. For example, successful female distance runners have an average-measured %BF value of 16.5%. Included in that group, however, is an athlete who won six consecutive international cross-country championships and another who held the 1972 world best time for the marathon; both of these runners had only 6% BF. At the other end of the range, the mid-1970s world record holder for the 50-mi run tested at 35.8% BF (

Brownell et al., 1987

). These extremes point out the importance of not establishing a specific %BF value for all athletes in any sport. The average values should not be interpreted as optimal values for all athletes competing in a particular sport. If %BF values are suggested to athletes, they should be in the form of a range of values. The health and the performance of the athlete need to be monitored within that range, and individual adjustments made based on this monitoring. Eating disorders, which are sometimes associated with attempts to control body composition for sport, are discussed fully in
 
Chapter 6

.




It must be emphasized that the key to weight and fat loss is not exercise per se but the achievement of a sufficient caloric deficit through exercise (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Donnelly et al., 1991

;
 
Walberg, 1989

). Diet alone can also achieve a caloric deficit, but when weight is lost through dieting alone, it includes a greater percentage of FFW. Dynamic aerobic endurance activity is most helpful for increasing caloric expenditure; dynamic resistance activity (which is low in caloric cost) acts more directly to increase muscle mass. There seems to be no direct influence of training intensity on fat mass loss; however, there is a volume effect in short-term studies, as more exercise equates to greater caloric expenditure (

Hansen et al., 2007

).




A 1995 meta-analysis (

Garrow and Summerbell, 1995

) of 28 studies found that aerobic exercise without dietary restriction led to weight loss but had little effect on FFW (meaning at least that it was maintained). Conversely, resistance exercise had little effect on weight loss but increased FFW by approximately 2–5 lb

 (1–2 kg). More importantly, recent evidence has shown that overweight/obese individuals benefit from exercise even if they remain overweight/obese. The Focus on Application box in
 
Chapter 7

 discusses some of this evidence from dynamic aerobic exercise. Active overweight/obese persons have better risk profiles for the diseases identified earlier and lower rates of morbidity and mortality than their sedentary counterparts. These health gains are related to the beneficial changes in glucose-insulin responses, lipoprotein values, and cardiovascular function. There is also some evidence that resistance training improves high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), insulin, and blood pressure risk factors. Thus, the value of exercise training for overweight individuals goes far beyond the sometimes minor contribution to weight loss (

ACSM, 2009

).




Children and adolescents appear similar to adults in relation to the influence of exercise training on body composition. Comparisons of young athletes with their sedentary counterparts typically show that both boy and girl athletes have a lower percent body fat and higher FFW values. The variation among sports is similar to that for adults. Training studies also show that a decrement in percent body fat results from systematically applied exercise programs (

Boileau et al., 1985

;
 
Epstein and Goldfield, 1999

;
 
Plowman, 1989

). Two separate systematic reviews (

Atlantis et al., 2006

;
 
Watts et al., 2005

) both concluded that exercise training does not consistently decrease body weight in children and adolescents but that exercise is associated with beneficial changes in fat (decreases) and fat-free mass (increases). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Growth and Health Study reported that at ages 18–19 years, BMI was 2.10 kg·m
−2
 less for active white girls and 2.98 kg·m
−2
 less for active black girls than their sedentary counterparts. Similarly, the sum of skinfolds was 15.04 and 13.54 mm less for the active white and black girls, respectively, than their inactive counterparts. Active girls were doing only the equivalent of 30 minutes of brisk walking 5 d·wk
−1
. The change in reported energy intake ranged from 17 to 121 kcal·d
−1
 (

Kimm et al., 2005

).

The Effect of Increased and Decreased Exercise on Weight Loss and Gain






Even those individuals who routinely use exercise, whether
 intentionally (many fitness participants) or unintentionally (athletes), to control body weight have variations in their exercise routines. The off-season transition phase, illness/injury, family obligations, work or school demands, aging, weather, travel, holidays, or simply motivational lags often result in temporary or gradual decreases in overall physical activity. Williams investigated the impact of decreases in exercise and contrasted them with changes in body weight and waist circumference with equal amounts of exercise increase.







Data from 4,632 males (M) and 1,953 females (F) whose running distances increased 2 km·wk
−1
 (1.25 mi·wk
−1
) or more and 17,280 M and 5,970 F whose running distances decreased by the same amount during 7.7 years of follow-up were analyzed. All data were self-reported and collected nationally at races and through a popular running magazine. Baseline values for BMI (M, 23.9 vs. 23.8 kg·m
−2
; F, 21.2 vs. 21.3 kg·m
−2
) and waist circumference (M, 84.3 vs. 84.4 cm; F, 68.5 vs. 68.6 cm) were all in the normal range and similar between those who increased and decreased their running distance, respectively. The groups differed slightly by age (M, 43.6 vs. 44.8 years; F, 37.8 vs. 38.2 years). Running distances were divided into six intervals (0–8, 8–16, 16–32, 32–48, 48–64, and 64–80 km·wk
−1
 [~0–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, and 40–50 mi·wk
−1
]).








The accompanying graph presents the results for BMI. Look first at the right axis and the line labeled “weight loss from initiating running.”








Read this line from left to right and note that the axis has a loss in BMI (numerically negative changes) above the zero point. At the lowest levels of running (<20 km·wk
−1
), BMI actually increases. As previously noted, this could be because of increases in FFW, a compensatory decrease in other daily activity, or a combination of both. It is not until a man runs 25 km·wk
−1
 (15.5 mi·wk
−1
) and a woman 48 km·wk
−1
 (30 mi·wk
−1
) that a reduction in BMI is expected. For example, a male nonrunner who at follow-up was running 41 km·wk
−1
 (25.5 mi·wk
−1
) would have an expected change of −0.23 kg·m
−2
 in his BMI.








Now look at the left axis and the line labeled “weight gain from running cessation.” Read this line from right to left and note that the axis has a gain in BMI (numerically positive changes) above the zero point. Decreasing running distance causes significant weight gain at all running levels, but the gain becomes progressively greater (the slope of the line steeper) with the fewer kilometers (miles) run. Thus, a man who reduced his running from 16 km·wk
−1
 to nothing would expect to see a gain in BMI of 0.81 kg·m
−2
. If an individual male reduced his running from 32 km·wk
−1
 to nothing, he would expect to see a gain in BMI of 1.26 kg·m
−2
. However, if this individual male reduced his distance run from 32 to 16 km·wk
−1
, his increase in BMI would only be 0.45 kg·m
−2
 (1.26–0.81 kg·m
−2
).








The most striking aspect of the overall graph interpretation is the asymmetry between the changes in BMI loss with increasing exercise and BMI gain with decreasing exercise. Above 32 km·wk
−1
 (the equivalent of 30 kcal·kg
−1
·wk
−1
) for men and 16 km·wk
−1
 (the equivalent of 15 kcal·kg
–1
·wk
−1
) for women, the effects of training and detraining are comparable. The weight gains and losses associated with changes in energy expended in exercise above this threshold are probably reversible. However, at exercise levels below this, an interruption in exercise would be expected to produce a weight gain that is not reversed simply by resuming the prior exercise level. Changes for waist circumference parallel these for BMI.








Food intake data were not available for the study participants, but clearly, there was an imbalance between intake and output. Recall that appetite does not automatically adjust in proportion to energy expenditure decrement. Obviously, the duration of detraining was quite long in this study. However, the process of energy imbalance begins immediately. Unfortunately, what happens to many of us is that a temporary decrease in exercise (think of holidays) is accompanied by excess food intake.








These results suggest:






1.
 Weight gains from becoming inactive may not be reversible simply by resuming prior activity levels. This depends on the accustomed level of activity and is most evident in the least active.




2.
 It is important to minimize exercise variation and/or to match exercise variation with conscious equal adjustment in energy intake for long-term weight control.

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Guidelines for Evaluating a Weight Loss Diet






Throughout this chapter, guidelines are presented for developing and evaluating exercise programs through the use
 of the training principles. Because the most effective technique for weight loss and control is a combination of diet and exercise, the following guidelines can assist in the development and evaluation of diets intended for weight loss. An acceptable diet should meet the following standards (ACSM, 2000
, 2007
; Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005
; van Horn et al., 1998
). The diet should:





1.
 Provide a daily energy intake of approximately 500–1,000 kcal below normal prediet intake, but not lower than RMR (~1,200 kcal·d
−1
 for females and 1,500 kcal·d
−1
 for males), or the total calories halfway between RMR and 30% above RMR.




2.
 Meet the nutritional requirements of 45–65% carbohydrate, 10–35% protein, and 20–35% total fat (<10% saturated, trans fats as low as possible) and the Dietary Reference Intakes/Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamins and minerals.




3.
 Emphasize a variety of food choices and allow for individual and cultural preferences in terms of acquisition, taste, preparation, and cost.




4.
 Not be based on some “secret” ingredient or “magic” combination of foods or require the simultaneous ingestion of “fat burning” or other supplements. Taking a daily multivitamin may be acceptable.




5.
 Be backed by credible scientific or medical organizations (e.g., the American Dietetic Association or the American Heart Association) and/or well-designed research published in peer-reviewed journals that supports both the effectiveness and safety of the diet. Anyone may write a diet book; the publication of diet books is not regulated by any governmental agency or professional society. If someone intends to make money with the diet, “let the buyer beware.”




6.
 Include at least three meals per day (more frequent smaller meals are also acceptable) and 74–100 fluid oz of drinking water and other beverages per day. Alcohol intake should be controlled.






What about the manipulation of macronutrients in diets? Claims that the ingestion of a low-glycemic index diet (as opposed to a high-glycemic index diet) will increase the weight loss have generally not been supported. Calorie-restricted diets differing substantially in glycemic load can result in comparable long-term weight loss. If anything, a reduced calorie intake may be harder to sustain on a low-glycemic diet over time (

Das et al., 2007

). Low-carbohydrate/high-fat diets and high-protein diets can be successful for weight loss but are probably based on water loss, ketosis-induced appetite suppression, and high satiety. Long-term health risks are a concern, and such low-carbohydrate diets are not recommended (

Astrup et al., 2004

). Similarly, high-carbohydrate diets have been shown to have unfavorable effects on blood lipid levels (

Volek et al., 2005

). Moderate levels of fat (20% to <30%) as recommended by
 
American College of Sports Medicine (2001)

 often represent a decrease in fat intake in overweight/obese individuals. However, it is probably not fat restriction per se that results in weight loss but the decrease in total caloric intake (

Volek et al., 2005

). Fat restriction avoids the increase in ghrelin caused by dietary energy restriction (

Weigle et al., 2003

). In addition, a fat intake less than 30% could have beneficial health effects as well that result from the fat restriction per se. Some theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that diets high in protein are beneficial for weight loss and weight maintenance (

ACSM, 2001

;
 
Layman, 2004

;
 
Volek et al., 2005

). A high-protein diet can be defined as 18–30% or a ratio of 1 g PRO/1.5 g CHO. A high-protein, moderate-fat, moderate-carbohydrate diet has been shown to be better than a low-protein, moderate-fat, high-carbohydrate diet of equal caloric restriction either alone or when combined with an aerobic plus resistance exercise program for promoting weight loss (

Meckling and Sherfey, 2007

). Similarly, a high-protein diet has been shown to maintain weight after weight loss with or without controlling for the percentage of carbohydrate in the diet (

Weigle et al., 2005

;
 
Westerterp-Plantenga et al., 2004

). Finally, a high-protein diet was shown to maintain FFW, even when weight was regained (

Leidy et al., 2007a

;
 
Westerterp-Plantenga et al., 2004

). The benefits of high-protein diets have been attributed in these experimental studies to decreased food efficiency, decreased ghrelin rise, increased leptin sensitivity, increased thermogenic effects of feeding, and increased satiety. A study (

Dansinger et al., 2005

) of four popular diets (Atkins, carbohydrate restriction; Zone, 40–30–30 macronutrient balance; Weight Watchers [caloric restriction]; Ornish, fat restriction) found that after a year, each diet modestly reduced body weight by approximately 2–3 kg (~4–7 lb) and improved several cardiac risk factors. The amount of weight lost was related to adherence to the diet but not to the diet type.








Above all, it must be remembered that the macronutrient content of any diet will affect body weight only when there is a reduction in caloric intake that results in a negative caloric balance. The health costs or benefits of any diet must also be considered. The optimal levels of each macronutrient beyond those established in the current dietary guidelines, if optimal levels actually exist, remain to be determined.

The Effects of Diet Plus Exercise Training on Body Composition and Weight


Studies that have combined diet and exercise seem to suggest that this approach is best for positive, long-term changes (Washburn et al., 2014
). Body weight is not lost faster in combined exercise plus diet programs than in diet alone programs because, as has been said several times, weight loss is all about achieving a negative caloric balance and changes in fat mass exceeding changes in FFW (Hansen et al., 2007
; Stiegler and Cunliffe, 2006
; Wing, 1999
).



Exercise training, whether alone or in combination with dietary restriction, achieves the desirable maintenance of FFW (

Stiegler and Cunliffe, 2006

). In some cases, muscle mass can actually be gained, despite very similar total weight loss (

Caudwell et al., 2013

;
 
Zuti and Golding, 1976

). Furthermore, the addition of an exercise component to a weight control program carries several other benefits. These include improved dietary compliance, the maintenance of resting metabolic rate, the numerous fitness benefits mentioned throughout this chapter, and the possibility of more effective maintenance of weight loss (discussed later in this chapter) (

Hansen et al., 2007

).




The key to weight loss while maintaining FFW is probably the total caloric deficit, the inclusion of resistance training, and the nutrient content (PRO and CHO) of the calories ingested (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Walberg, 1989

). One advantage of adding exercise to a weight loss regimen may simply be that it allows an individual to ingest more kilocalories and still be in a negative caloric balance. Eating a moderately restricted diet allows for adequate nutrition and lifestyle changes that can be tolerated for a lifetime; by contrast, a VLCD can seldom be sustained for a prolonged time. Furthermore, physical activity will increase weight loss if dietary restriction is moderate, but not if severe, that is, less than the number of calories equal to RMR (

ACSM, 2009

).



The Effects of Diet, Exercise Training, and Diet Plus Exercise Training on Abdominal Obesity


Of special concern is the impact of diet, exercise training, and diet plus exercise training on abdominal fat, both subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), also known as visceral abdominal adipose tissue, as illustrated in Figure 8.11
. The concern is that abdominal fat is known to be an independent predictor of the metabolic risk factors that are the antecedents for type II (non–insulin-dependent) diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and various cardiovascular diseases.









FIGURE 8.11
 Abdominal Obesity.
 While many individuals are concerned with scale weight, the amount of visceral abdominal fat is more important for health.





A review of studies investigating the impact of diet alone on VAT found that for every kilogram of weight loss, VAT was reduced 3–4 cm
2
, or approximately 2–3% of the total VAT. Furthermore, there appeared to be a preferential reduction in VAT (which is desirable) over subcutaneous fat loss (

Ross, 1997

). The degree of caloric restriction (low-calorie or very-low-calorie diet) does not appear to have any influence on the ratio of the % change in VAT to the % change in total fat. Individuals with the most VAT lose the greatest amount of VAT (

Smith and Zachwieja, 1999

). The macronutrient content of the diet does not appear to influence the amount of visceral fat lost (

de Souza et al., 2012

).




The impact of exercise training alone on abdominal obesity in adults has been confounded by what measure was used to evaluate it and whether or not a weight loss was achieved. In general, in the absence of weight loss, abdominal fat levels are not reduced if measured by waist-to-hip ratio or waist circumference. Waist circumference is responsive to exercise training, but a change in waist circumference is not always evident

 when imaging methods show decreased abdominal obesity. Conversely, physical activity with or without weight loss is associated with reductions in visceral and abdominal subcutaneous fat loss when measured by techniques such as MRI or computerized tomography (CT) scan (

Ross and Janssen, 1999

). The fact that changes in SAAT and VAT can occur without changes in body weight is important because it means that individuals using exercise to lose weight need to be informed of this possibility and appropriate measures taken so that they can see that positive changes are taking place despite what the scale may indicate. On the other hand, both total and abdominal fat are generally much more reduced when weight is lost. Limited evidence from randomized trials shows that reductions occur in abdominal (SAAT and VAT) fat when moderate- to high-intensity aerobic exercise interventions of at least 8 weeks’ duration are undertaken by middle- to older-aged, overweight or obese males and females (

Kay and Fiatarone Singh, 2006

;
 
Ross and Janssen, 1999

).




A systematic review of clinical trials (

Ohkawara et al., 2007

) reinforced the conclusions that in obese adults with no metabolic disorders, there is (1)a significant relationship between aerobic exercise training and visceral fat reduction and (2) that although visceral fat reduction is significantly related to weight reduction during the aerobic exercise training, a significant reduction in visceral fat can occur without significant weight loss. Moreover, there is a dose-response relationship between the amount of aerobic exercise and the amount of visceral fat reduction. At least 10 MET-hr·wk
−1
 of aerobic activity appears to be the threshold to achieve visceral fat reduction. Brisk walking at 3.0 mi·hr
−1
 represents 3.3 METs. Thus, it would take roughly 182 minutes of walking at this pace to achieve the threshold—very comparable to current exercise recommendations (

ACSM, 2009

).




Although some evidence shows that the average % change in VAT to the % change in fat ratio is higher as a result of exercise training than caloric restriction (CR) alone, it is insufficient to regard exercise training as a more specific therapy for visceral fat loss than dietary restriction (

Smith and Zachwieja, 1999

). This is shown by a randomized controlled trial conducted on 48 healthy males and females with an initial BMI of 27.3 kg·m
−2
. Participants were assigned either to a 20% CR diet, an exercise program (EX) designed to produce a similar energy deficit, or healthy lifestyle control group (HL). After 1 year, weight changes corresponding to −10.7%, −8.4%, and −1.7% occurred in the CR, EX, and HL groups, respectively. Whole-body fat mass as well as visceral and SAAT decreased significantly and comparably in the CR and EX group but did not change in the HL group (

Racette et al., 2006

).




The benefits of strength training on VAT reduction are unclear. A 2013 meta-analysis that included only 1 strength training study and 2 studies that combined strength and aerobic training versus 12 strictly aerobic training studies found that aerobic exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity had a greater effect on VAT than low-intensity aerobic exercise or resistance strength training in adults. The authors concluded that combining aerobic training with resistance strength training did not appear to result in a greater decrease of visceral adipose tissue than aerobic training alone (

Visseers et al., 2013

). However, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (

Mekary et al., 2015

) that has tracked 10,500 healthy males since 1996 found that less age-associated waist circumference increase was seen in those who had a 20 min
.
d
−1
 increase in weight training than a similar amount of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity. Finally, two additional recent studies, these involving obese adolescents, support the importance of weight training. In the first study, it was determined that strength training alone was as effective in reducing VAT as aerobic training or aerobic plus resistance training (

Alberga et al., 2015

); in the second, it was found that aerobic plus resistance training was more effective than aerobic training alone (

Damaso et al., 2014

). Obviously, more research is needed here to determine the precise role of resistance training in VAT reduction. Despite an overall paucity of research, interactions between exercise training/physical fitness and abdominal adiposity seem to extend to children and adolescents as exemplified by the two studies reported above. Additionally, a cross-sectional study of 9- and 15-year-old students has shown that cardiovascular fitness is inversely associated with abdominal adiposity

 independently of the time spent at different intensities of physical activity and total physical activity. However, in the low-fit group, time spent in vigorous physical activity was related to lower abdominal adiposity. Suggested cutoff values for the inclusion of vigorous physical activity are ≥40 and ≥25 minutes for boys and girls and ≥20 and ≥15 minutes for adolescent males and females (

Ortega et al., 2007

,
 
2010

). The Focus on Application: Clinically Relevant box shows that exercise training can reduce subcutaneous adipose tissue and retard visceral adipose tissue increase in children (

Owens et al., 1999

).




The few studies that have investigated the impact of diet plus exercise training on VAT have shown that the relative reduction in VAT is similar to the response induced by diet alone; that is, the addition of exercise training did not provide any preferential benefit for the reduction of VAT (

Fayh et al., 2013

;
 
Ross, 1997

). This may or may not be true for subcutaneous adipose tissue, as seen by the results from a 20-week intervention study (

You et al., 2006

). Forty-five obese (BMI, 33 kg·m
−2
) middle-aged females were assigned to one of three groups, each intended to achieve a 2,800-kcal·wk
−1
 deficit: diet only, diet plus low-intensity exercise, and diet plus high-intensity exercise. All three interventions reduced body weight, fat mass, % BF, waist circumference, and hip girth similarly. However, only the diet plus exercise interventions significantly reduced subcutaneous abdominal adipose cell size. Whether this is another case where the use of waist circumference to reflect changes in VAT masked results that imaging might have shown was unknown.




A study by
 
Redman et al. (2007)

 provides some insight. This study directly compared the effects of equal amounts of exercise increase and caloric reduction on weight loss, total fat mass (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), and visceral fat mass (measured by computed tomography). Participants were randomized into a control group ([C] who ingested a healthy weight maintenance diet), a caloric restriction group ([CR] who had a 25% reduction in energy intake), or a caloric restriction plus exercise group ([CR + EX] who had a 12.5% caloric restriction and 12.5% increase in energy expenditure). No significant changes occurred in the control group. The CR group lost 8.3% body weight and the CR + EX group lost 8.1% body weight. These losses were not different between groups. Fat losses are presented in
 
Figure 8.12

. They represented losses of 27 and 22% for total fat mass, 31 and 24% for VAT mass, and approximately 30 and 25% for subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue in males and females, respectively. Males showed a significant preferential reduction in VAT. These data suggest that exercise training plays the same role as caloric restriction in terms of changes in total fat mass and abdominal visceral fat mass. However, the addition of exercise did improve the aerobic fitness of the participants more, and this has important additional health implications. The pattern of fat distribution throughout the whole body and within the abdominal compartment was not altered by caloric restriction, reinforcing the idea that individuals are genetically programmed for fat storage in a particular pattern.

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Exercise Training and Visceral Fat in Obese Children






High levels of total body fat mass and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) increase the likelihood that children will develop other coronary artery disease risk factors and non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Owens et al. (1999)
 conducted this study to determine if controlled physical training would have a favorable impact on VAT and % body fat in obese children. These authors assigned volunteers to a control group or a physical training group. The physical training group exercised for 40 minutes, at an average heart rate of 157 b·min−1
, 5 days a week, for 4 months. The accompanying graph presents the percent change in several variables in the training group and in the control group after 4 months.







These data indicate that obese children:






1.
 Were capable of participating in a high-intensity exercise training program




2.
 Experienced a loss in fat mass, % body fat, and SAAT, whereas the control group experienced a gain in fat mass and SAAT over the same period




3.
 Experienced a smaller increase in VAT than the control group






This study indicates that increasing physical activity of obese children, even without dietary intervention, can improve the aspects of body composition related to cardiovascular risk factors.

Application of the Training Principles for Weight and Body Composition Loss and/or Control




Based on the previously described impact of diet, exercise training, and diet plus exercise training on body weight and composition, the training principles can be applied to achieve weight and body composition loss, change, and/or control using the following guidelines. These guidelines are intended for the mildly or moderately overweight and overfat individuals whom physical educators and fitness leaders are likely to encounter; they are not meant for more severely obese individuals, who require more drastic reductions and medical supervision.


Specificity


In reality, weight/body composition control is important in three situations:



1.
 When the goal is to lose weight




2.
 When the goal is to prevent weight gain, particularly that which tends to occur as individuals age




3.
 When the goal is to maintain weight loss





Table 8.3

 presents physical activity recommendations for weight loss and maintenance from several organizations. The principles for weight loss are discussed first; those for weight maintenance will be discussed under the maintenance training principle.

 Physical Activity Recommendations for Weight Loss and Maintenance

Weight Los
s


Only the 2001 and 2009 recommendations by the American College of Sports Medicine are directed specifically at weight loss. The general goals of weight and body composition control should be (as stated previously) to maximize the decrease in body weight or body fat while minimizing FFW loss and supplying adequate nutrition. To accomplish this, American College of Sports Medicine (2001)
 recommends a caloric deficit of 500–1,000 kcal·d−1
 achieved by a combination of decreased energy intake (dietary restriction) and increased energy expenditure (exercise and/or physical activity). Both dynamic aerobic endurance exercise and dynamic resistance training exercise are recommended. The endurance exercise modality selected (walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, aerobic dancing, stair stepping, or stair climbing) does not matter. The aerobic activity produces most of the caloric deficit, while the resistance activity helps in the maintenance of fat-free weight. A minimum of 150 min·wk−1
 of moderate-intensity physical activity is encouraged. A dose-response relationship exists with more physical activity/caloric deficit resulting in more weight loss at least initially.


Spot Reduction


Another way to interpret specificity in relation to weight control might be a desire to reduce body fat from a specific body location called spot reduction. The idea behind spot reduction is that fat will be selectively mobilized and thus reduced from the area exercised. For example, as seen in Figure 8.13
, individuals wishing to reduce his or her abdominal region would concentrate on pelvic tilts, curls, and sit-ups.









FIGURE 8.13
 Anatomically Specific Exercises Do Tone Muscles But Do Not Reduce Fat in That Area.





Consistent training of specific muscles can increase muscle tone, which may give a slimming appearance (or if hypertrophy occurs, give a more defined appearance). However, no experimental evidence shows that fat (in the form of fatty acids) is mobilized preferentially

 from adipose cells located near active muscles; that is, spot reducing may be an attractive idea but in reality does not work for either males or females. In one study, when 13 men underwent a 27-day training program during which 5,004 sit-ups were performed, no significant changes occurred in %BF, skinfold, or girth measurements either as a result of training or in comparison with six nonexercising controls. Adipose biopsy measures did show significant decreases in fat cell diameters, but there was no significant difference in these changes between the heavily exercised abdominal site and nonexercised gluteal and subscapular locations (

Katch et al., 1984

). A newer study involving 24 males and females 18–40 years divided into either a control group or an abdominal exercise group confirmed these results. The exercise group performed seven abdominal exercises, for 2 sets of 10 reps, 5 days per week for 6 weeks. There was no significant effect on body weight, %BF, android fat, abdominal circumference, and abdominal or suprailiac skinfold measurements although the exercise group did significantly increase the number of curl-ups performed (

Vispute et al., 2011

). Similarly, when 7 males and 4 females participated in 12 weeks of localized muscle endurance resistance training, the training was effective in reducing total fat mass, but this reduction was not achieved in the trained body segment (

Ramirez-Campillo et al., 2013

).




Fat is mobilized to be used as a fuel by hormonal action. Hormones circulate to all parts of the body via the bloodstream. The distribution of body fat in the android (abdominal), gynoid (gluteofemoral), or intermediate pattern does not appear to affect the amount of weight lost by caloric deficit, nor is the relative distribution of fat altered by the weight loss. That is, the general shape of the individual is preserved despite a reduction in the total amount of fat and despite any attempt at spot reduction. Because spot reduction does not work, any activity that burns enough calories to cause a negative caloric balance can be used.



Weight Gain Prevention


Five of the other recommendations from national and international organizations (ACSM, 2009
; Erlichman et al., 2002
; Haskell et al. (ACSM/AHA), 2007
; Institute of Medicine, 2002
; Saris et al. (IASO), 2003
; Table 8.3
) deal with strategies to prevent weight gain [defined by American College of Sports Medicine (2009)
 as an increase of greater than 3%] in an individual initially of normal weight. All of these have concluded that a minimum of 45–60 min·d−1
 or 150 min·wk−1
 of physical activity are needed for adults, and probably more for children. There is now sufficient prospective epidemiological evidence that an increase of approximately 350 kcal·d−1
 (0.25 PAL units) or 50–60 minutes of moderate-intensity activity is needed to prevent weight gain over the years (Haskell et al., 2007
; Saris et al., 2003
).



The reports cited above introduced another way of quantifying physical activity—
physical activity level (PAL)
. The PAL is defined as the ratio of total energy expenditure (TEE) to 24-hour resting or basal/resting energy expenditure (BMR/RMR), that is, TEE/RMR. Four categories of PAL are frequently used: sedentary (1.0–1.39), low active (1.4–1.59), active (1.6–1.89), and very active (1.9–2.5) (

Ross and Janssen, 2007

). By definition, RMR alone is equal to a PAL of 1.0. The sedentary category includes the energy expenditure required for BMR/RMR, TEF, and maintenance activities of daily independent living (ADL). Because everyone has some values for TEF and ADL, a baseline of approximately 1.4 is typically the starting point for calculating additional needed energy expenditure. Thus, if an individual had an RMR of 1,400 kcal·d
−1
, the difference between PALs of 1.4 and 1.7 is an additional 420 kcal of activity (1.7–1.4 = 0.30; 0.30 × 1,400 kcal = 420 kcal) (

Saris et al., 2003

). This can be achieved by a combination of exercise and other physical activities such as mowing the grass, cleaning house, occupational demands, etc., during the day.

Overload


When weight loss is the goal, overload really means the attainment of a net deficit. However, the general guidelines for the application of the training principles for dynamic aerobic endurance training outlined in Chapters 5
 and 13
 also apply here. The one exception is a shift in the importance of intensity and duration. The bottom line is that burning large numbers of calories is what is most important
.



Previously sedentary, unfit, and overweight or overfat individuals cannot work at high-intensity levels for even short periods of time, and they should not try to. They do not tolerate high-intensity exercise well, risk injury and the inability to then continue exercising, and, at the very least, often dislike the exercise and/or feelings associated with fatigue so much that they will stop. Instead, low-intensity activities continued for a long duration are recommended. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommended duration of exercise for weight loss is presented in
 
Table 8.3

. Note that this recommendation is for a minimum of 150 min·wk
−1
 of moderate-intensity exercise progressing to greater than 250 min·wk
−1
 of endurance and resistance training. This can be broken up into sessions in any number of different ways. The bottom line is that any combination of frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise that burns sufficient calories to obtain a deficit is the goal for weight loss.




This recommendation is contrary to a common misconception that the best way to lose fat is to burn fat doing long-duration, low-intensity exercise. Although it is true that fat is the dominant fuel in long-duration, low-intensity exercise, the important factor in weight loss is to establish a caloric deficit, regardless of the fuel being used during exercise. This principle is exemplified in a study by
 
Ballor et al. (1990)

 of two groups of obese women on equally restricted caloric intakes (1,200 kcal·d
−1
). One group exercised on a cycle ergometer at 51% of their peak
 

 for 50 minutes and the other at 85% of their peak
 

 for 25 minutes. The low-intensity group expended an average of 283 kcal per session at an RER of 0.80, and the high-intensity group expended an average of 260 kcal per session at an RER of 0.92. The estimated fat utilization was 26% for the high-intensity group and 66.6% for the low-intensity group. Although the high-intensity group did improve their cardiovascular fitness more, both groups lost equal amounts of body weight, fat-free mass, fat mass, and percent body fat and had the same decrease in the sum of five skinfold thicknesses.




The advantage of the low-intensity exercise is not an increased loss of fat but a better initial tolerance to the exercise sessions. Individuals who are overweight or obese are also frequently out of shape, and low-intensity work at the initiation of an exercise program is more appropriate and less likely to bring about muscle and joint problems than a high-intensity program. On the other hand, more active or higher fit individuals need not think about decreasing exercise intensity in order to reap the weight control benefits of exercise. The intensity and duration can be manipulated to best suit each individual interested in body weight or composition control.




Increasing caloric expenditure per session and increasing the frequency of the exercise both enhance fat and weight loss. An individual combining dynamic aerobic endurance and resistance weight training can alternate days (three each) and still have a rest day or can combine sessions on each of 3 or 4 days. The caloric cost of dynamic resistance exercise is less than that of dynamic endurance exercise, and this difference needs to be taken into account when designing the exercise program for weight loss or maintenance.




In calculations of the energy cost of an activity session, the
 net
 value rather than the
 gross
 value should be used. That is, the calories that would have been burned anyway, had the individual been sedentary, should be subtracted from the cost of the exercise (

ACSM, 2000

;
 
Pacy et al., 1986

). For example, if the energy cost of playing tennis is 7.1 kcal·min
−1
 but the individual would have expended 1.3 kcal·min
−1
 at rest, the net cost is 5.8 kcal·min
−1
. Thus, it would take almost 52 minutes of tennis to burn 300 excess calories, not 42 minutes.



Rest/Recovery/Adaptation


The importance of adaptation in caloric deficit lies in the fact that the composition of the weight loss varies the longer the deficit is maintained. One consistent, moderate-deficit diet is therefore better than a series of short, very calorically restricted diets. The individual must get past the early water loss stages and into the stage where fat loss is proportionally the greatest. This adaptation will occur in addition to the specific adaptations to the exercise training. There is no rest or recovery specific for weight loss beyond that built into any exercise program.


Progression


The greatest progression is made in the number of calories that can be expended in exercise as the individual adapts to the training. When the calories expended in exercise increase, the amount of food ingested can be kept at the same level, thereby increasing the deficit and/or possibly offsetting any decrease in RMR that may occur. Another possibility is to proportionally increase the amount of food ingested to maintain the same relative deficit. The fact that a lower body weight may also mean a lower-energy expenditure for any given physical activity or exercise (Ghiani et al., 2015
) should be kept in mind. Although it may take a greater caloric deficit to continue to lose weight as the weight loss program continues (Thomas et al., 2013
), progression should not be interpreted as an attempt to exercise more and more while eating less and less beyond a reasonable point.


Individualization


To tailor a weight or fat loss program for an individual, several evaluations and calculations are helpful. The first is the direct measurement or estimation of the person’s RMR. Formulas such as those presented earlier in this chapter (Table 8.1
) can be used to estimate RMR fairly easily. Second, the nutrient and caloric intake of the individual should be analyzed. Computer programs are available for this analysis. Third, the number of calories normally expended in daily activity needs to be calculated. Lists of the caloric cost per kilogram of activities, such as that in Table 4.7
 in Chapter 4
, can be used for this calculation
.



Once these numbers are known, the relative proportions of the caloric deficit to come from food intake and from energy expenditure can be determined. How much comes from which category should depend on the current caloric intake and fitness level of the individual.







Example






If a sedentary, unfit female ingests 2,000 kcal·d−1
 and expends 1,800 kcal·d−1
, 1,200 kcal of which is RMR, then an initial 650-kcal decrement makes sense (2,000−1,800 = 200 kcal to get to a caloric balance, and a 450-kcal deficit for a weight loss). If this individual is really unfit, 100 kcal·d−1
 of exercise may be all she can do; the other 550 kcal needs to come from decreasing the calories ingested. This diet would still allow for daily caloric ingestion of 1,350 kcal. If, however, the individual is relatively fit, more calories can be expended in exercise and either a greater intake of food allowed or a greater deficit achieved.







The caloric ingestion should not fall below the RMR. Although the flat values of 1,200 for females and 1,500 kcal·d
−1
 for males are often suggested as a lower limit of caloric intake (

ACSM, 1983

), a more individualized system is to calculate a value halfway between RMR and 30% above RMR as used in the above example (

Schelkun, 1991

).



Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


Weight loss tends to be uneven, even when caloric intake and output remain the same. Weight loss is fastest in the early stages of caloric deficit and then tends to level off. This pattern occurs, at least in part, because of the early loss of large amounts of glycogen and water. Later, RMR may decrease, and food efficiency and adaptive decreases in exercise energy expenditure may become a factor (Astrup et al., 1999
; Bray, 1969
; Major et al., 2007
). Although few who are attempting to lose weight want to hear about these patterns, they need to be informed so that they are mentally prepared to deal with them. Reverting to old habits of food intake and a sedentary lifestyle (in a sense, detraining) will result in a rapid retrogression or complete reversal, exemplified by regaining lost weight.


Maintenance


As stated previously, many more people manage to lose weight than to maintain that weight loss. The key to the maintenance of a weight or fat loss may be exercise training (ACSM, 2009
; Jakicic and Rogers, 2013
; Saris et al., 2003
; Tate et al., 2007
; Wing, 1999
). As can be seen in Table 8.3
, the major public policy organizations in this area universally recommend exercise/physical activity to maintain weight loss. Evidence is compelling that prevention of weight regain in formerly obese individuals requires at least 60–90 minutes daily of moderate-intensity activity (or lesser amounts of vigorous-intensity activity) or approximately 200–300 min·wk−1
 (Jakicic and Rogers, 2013
; Saris et al., 2003
), which is more than a never-obese individual at a similar absolute body weight. This International Association for the Study of Obesity (IASO) recommendation and the remarkably consistent recommendations from the other reports all assume that caloric intake will not exceed that required to maintain weight. More activity does seem to be better than minimal activity (ACSM, 2009
). The level of food intake and exercise output at the weight the individual wishes to maintain must be continued for life.


Weight Cycling


Individuals who fail to maintain a weight loss often find themselves weight cycling. Weight cycling
 is repeated bouts of weight loss and regain. Sometimes, this cycling is called the “rhythm method of girth control” or the yo-yo effect.





Weight Cycling
 Repeated bouts of weight loss and regain.





In addition to nonmaintaining dieters, some athletes (wrestlers, jockeys, ski jumpers, and the like) (

Figure 8.14

) lose and gain weight purposely as they make weight for

 competition and then make up for missed meals by eating large quantities. Dieters may take months or years to complete each cycle; weight class athletes will do the same thing in 2 or 3 days. Furthermore, dieters may lose and gain 20–100 lb or more in each cycle, but athletes generally lose or gain less than 20 lb.










FIGURE 8.14
 Some Athletes, such as Jockeys, Undergo Repeated Bouts of Weight Cycling to Make Weight in Their Sport.
 Jockeys must “weigh out” before races and “weigh in” after races and be within 1 kg of their prerace weight.





While weight cycling is undoubtedly frustrating to dieters and possibly inconvenient for weight class athletes, there have also been concerns about how it affects the health of the individuals involved. It has been theorized that weight cycling slows down the RMR, increases the difficulty of subsequent weight loss, and enhances abdominal fat (

Blackburn et al., 1989

;
 
Nash, 1987

). Despite the theory, experimental evidence from studies testing the influence of weight cycling on RMR has had inconclusive results. High school wrestlers who weight cycled exhibited a 15% lower RMR than those who did not (

Steen et al., 1988

). However, college wrestlers who weight cycled had RMRs similar to those of non–weight-cycling wrestlers, and both wrestling groups had higher RMR values than nonwrestling controls (

Schmidt et al., 1993

). Studies of dieters who were initially obese or overweight are also conflicting, with only one (

Strychar et al., 2009

) of four studies finding evidence (

Beeson et al., 1989

;
 
van Dale and Saris, 1989

;
 
Wadden et al., 1992

) that a history of weight cycling affected RMR.




One study did find that prior weight cycling made subsequent weight loss harder (

Blackburn et al., 1989

). However, three other studies found no relationship between weight loss in one cycle and the subsequent rate or amount of weight loss in later cycles (

Beeson et al., 1989

;
 
van Dale and Saris, 1989

;
 
Wadden et al., 1992

).




Higher android (upper body) fat deposition, increased adiposity in normal weight, and greater weight gain have been found in several studies of individuals who weight cycled (

Anastasiou et al., 2010

;
 
Field et al., 2004

;
 
Rodin et al., 1990

;
 
Saarni et al., 2006

;
 
Strychar et al., 2009

;
 
Wallner et al., 2004

). Conversely, similar studies have found no difference in fat distribution, waist-to-hip ratio, or increased long-term weight gain as a function of weight-cycling history (

Wadden et al., 1992

). It may matter what the initial body weight/body composition is. Indeed, it is dieting to lose weight in people who are in the healthy normal range of body weight, rather than those who are overweight or obese, that most strongly and consistently predicts future weight gain (

Dulloo et al., 2015

). There is no direct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence that weight cycling leads to increased abdominal visceral fat deposition (

Montani et al., 2006

). Thus, neither body fat distribution nor body composition in humans is conclusively affected by a history of weight cycling (

National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity, 1994

). Another area of controversy involves evidence of increased cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality associated with weight cycling (

Diaz et al., 2005

;
 
Montani et al., 2006

;
 
Olson et al., 2000

;
 
Rzehak et al., 2007

). It has yet to be determined if this relationship is directly or indirectly linked to fat accumulation or other factors such as the effects of preexisting disease and smoking. There is no firm evidence that weight loss or weight fluctuation in otherwise healthy previously overweight/obese individuals is hazardous (

Graci et al., 2004

;
 
Strychar et al., 2009

;
 
Wannamethee et al., 2002

). However, counterintuitively, there is emerging evidence that fluctuations of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids, and insulin put more stress on the cardiovascular system of relatively lean people who initially did not really need to lose weight but chose to diet and ended up rapidly regaining more weight than they initially started with during each cycle than those who were initially overweight or obese (as a result of a progressive weight gain ) and ended up weight cycling. More and more individuals are beginning to diet at early ages and could thus be setting themselves up for major future difficulties (

Dulloo et al., 2015

;
 
Montani et al., 2015

). It is, of course, preferable to lose weight into a healthy zone and/or maintain a healthy weight rather than to weight cycle. This is unfortunately easier said than done.



Why Is It So Hard for Some People to Lose Body Weight/Fat?


Under the same energy deficit conditions, whether imposed by diet, exercise, or diet + exercise, there is a wide variation in body weight/fat loss. Why is it so hard for some individuals to lose weight? Why do almost all individuals lose less weight than theoretically expected? And why do virtually all individuals seeking to lose weight ultimately plateau (Melanson et al., 2013
)? How many times have you heard someone say: “I just can’t seem to lose that last 5 pounds”? There are a number of possibilities:



1.
 Lack of compliance




2.
 Overestimation of weight/fat loss based on the 3,500-kcal rule




3.
 A reduction in NEAT (nonexercise activity thermogenesis)




4.
 A compensatory increase in energy intake




5.
 Adaptive thermogenesis




Lack of compliance
 It is possible that any given individual is simply not exercising as much as he/she thinks or as much as is needed; and/or he/she is actually eating more than is being reported. Self-reporting of both of these variables is notoriously unreliable with underreporting of energy intake in the 20–30% range (

Melanson et al., 2013

;
 
Thomas et al., 2012

). If the energy imbalance is lower than prescribed, the weight/fat loss will also be lower. However, there are any number of well-controlled studies in which equally compliant individuals lose vastly different amounts of weight/fat (see
 
Figure 8.8

).




Overestimation of weight/fat loss based on the 3,500-kcal rule
 The deficiencies of this “rule” have been previously discussed. Part of the difficulty

 with this guideline is the uncertainty of the baseline energy needed to maintain the starting weight. If this value is inaccurate (and in many cases it is only a calculated estimate or generic 1,200–1,500 kcal·d
−1
), then the estimated changes based on this will also be inaccurate (

Hall, 2012

).




A reduction in NEAT (nonexercise activity thermogenesis)
 The failure of some individuals to lose weight/fat may also result from those individuals compensating for the increased energy expenditure during exercise by decreasing energy expenditure the rest of the day (sometimes called nonexercise activity thermogenesis or NEAT). Some, but not all, studies show a clear trend for a decrement in NEAT with an energy deficit and that decrement may be more likely when diet is used alone to achieve the deficit. Older individuals, in particular, are more likely to decrease nonexercise physical activity. Some of this may be on purpose (the individual may feel tired and decided to do less) or it may be unconscious (

Melanson et al., 2013

).




A compensatory increase in energy intake
 When exercise is used as the sole means of attempting to achieve an energy deficit and there is no specific energy intake restriction, a compensatory increase may occur in energy intake. The evidence is not compelling; however, whether this occurs or not may depend upon the degree of overweight/obesity at the initiation of the weight/fat loss program. In general, lean individuals (who nonetheless want to lose weight) tend to spontaneously increase their energy intake to unconsciously maintain energy balance whereas obese individuals are more likely not do this (

Melanson et al., 2013

;
 
Thomas et al., 2012

). Nonetheless, any given individual can be susceptible to enhanced hunger and hyperresponsive to the pleasures of eating and increase intake (

Melanson et al., 2013

;
 
Tremblay et al., 2013

).




Adaptive thermogenesis
 As stated earlier in this chapter, the term adaptive thermogenesis is not unequivocally defined but has come to mean any change in heat production or energy expenditure in response to a changing internal or external environment indicating either an increase or decrease in the efficiency of energy utilization. In the context of energy expenditure relative to weight/fat loss difficulty, this means a reduction in energy expenditure (i.e., an increase in energy efficiency). Decreasing adaptive thermogenesis is independent of both cold-induced and diet-induced thermogenesis. While cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis probably reside in brown adipose tissue and increase energy expenditure in the form of heat, decreasing adaptive thermogenesis is primarily located in fat-free mass (most body organs including skeletal muscle) (

Müller and Bosy-Westphal, 2013

). It may represent a defense mechanism to protect energy stores from depletion. This adaptation occurs in both resting metabolic rate (RMR) as previously discussed and the energy expenditure for any given physical activity/exercise. Part of the decrease cost of activity/exercise is because of any weight/fat loss that has occurred, but the remainder is due to the increase in energy efficiency. This change has been shown to average −15.4 kcal·kg
−1
·d
−1
 or 7% beyond weight-related changes. Paradoxically, the greater the decrease in thermogenesis, the higher the fasting hunger sensations. A decrease in plasma thyroid hormone (T3), leptin, and sympathetic nervous system activity has been found in weight-reduced obese individuals to be among the possible causes of adaptive thermogenesis (

Thomas et al., 2012

;
 
Tremblay and Chaput, 2009

;
 
Tremblay et al., 2013

).



Why Is It So Hard for Many People to Keep Body Weight/Fat Off Once It Has Been Lost?


There is no easy answer to why maintenance of a body weight/fat loss is so difficult. The only sure thing is that the problem is pervasive. The recidivism rate is approximately 75–80% in both youngsters and adults. That is, after an otherwise successful weight loss, the vast majority of obese individuals who have successfully lost weight regress to pre–weight loss levels of body weight/fat. This appears to result from the coordinated action of behavioral, neuroendocrine, and metabolic responses designed to maintain body energy stores (fat) at a central nervous system–defined “ideal” weight (Rosenbaum and Leibel, 2010
). The following factors appear to operate for weight/fat regain:



1.
 Lack of compliance




2.
 Altered enzymatic and hormonal functions




3.
 Adaptive thermogenesis




Lack of compliance
 The most obvious behavioral reason for the difficulty in maintaining weight loss, at least in part, is failure of compliance—the failure to maintain a regular exercise program of sufficient energy expenditure and/or a healthy calorically controlled dietary intake. Sooner or later, many individuals revert back to the same lifestyle that made their weight loss necessary initially. We live in an obesogenic environment marked by fast-food promotion, high availability of calorically dense foods and beverages, a social milieu based around partying, large serving sizes, and decreased necessity and opportunity for active employment, transport, and recreation. Such environmental pressures may overshadow biological control of body weight. It is important in the maintenance phase of a weight loss program to adhere to obesity-reducing behaviors. Those who successfully maintain weight losses exhibit frequent self-monitoring of food and calorie intake, select lower-calorie foods with little variation, plan meals in advance, eat breakfast, weight themselves regularly, limit television, and participate regularly in an exercise program (

Greenway, 2015

; Strohacker et al., 2014;
 
Sumithran and Proietto, 2013

). For example,
 
Tate et al. (2007)

 randomly assigned 202 overweight adults into either 18 months of standard behavioral treatment (SBT) with an exercise goal of 1,000 kcal·wk
−1
 or a high physical activity (HPA) group with an

 exercise goal of 2,500 kcal·wk
−1
 in addition to the SBT. The HPA group achieved significantly greater exercise levels and weight loss than the SBT group at 12 and 18 months of follow-up. At 30 months, the average exercise levels were no longer different between the groups, nor did weight loss differ. Participants who reported continuing to engage in high levels of exercise maintained a significantly larger weight loss.




There seems, however, to be more to the problem than a lack of compliance. Will power may be counteracted by powerful internal signals that sense deviations in body weight and trigger compensatory mechanisms such as those discussed below (

Dulloo, 2007

;
 
Major et al., 2007

)




Altered enzymatic and hormonal functions
 When individuals gain weight, body composition also changes including significant alterations in adipose cellularity. Initially, adipose cell size increases (hypertrophy), but eventually, adipose cell number will also increase (hyperplasia). With body weight loss, adipocyte hypertrophy decreases, but adipocyte hyperplasia does not. One possible internal signal is lipoprotein lipase. Lipoprotein lipase is the enzyme responsible for fat synthesis and storage in adipose tissue. It has been theorized that lipoprotein lipase notifies the brain when fat cells have shrunk, as they would when the body is losing weight. In response, appetite increases, fat metabolism slows, and fat cells refill. In other words, “starving leads to stuffing.” The appetite not only increases but also seems selectively predisposed to disproportionately increase the amount of fat ingested. Fat, of course, is calorically dense. Furthermore, after restrictive dieting, the body can more easily convert other excess food nutrients to fatty acids. Previously or currently obese individuals seem to be more susceptible to the stimulus and response of lipoprotein lipase. In these individuals, lipoprotein lipase activity may be twice as high as in nondieting individuals. That is the bad news. The good news is that when people who are not obese are put on a mildly or moderately restricted diet, the changes in lipoprotein lipase activity are minimal. It may be that a certain amount of weight (~15% of total body weight) must be lost before lipoprotein lipase activity becomes a counterproductive factor (

Gershoff, 1991

,
 
1992

;
 
Nash, 1987

;
 
Schelkun, 1991

).




In addition to insulin, several other appetite-related hormones have a key role in weight regain after weight loss. With the exception of increases in PP (pancreatic peptide), changes in hormones following weight loss tend to favor weight regain by increasing hunger and promoting energy storage. Following diet-induced weight loss, there are increases in circulating levels of ghrelin and decreases in circulating levels of leptin, PYY (peptide tyrosine-tyrosine), CCK (cholecystokinin), insulin, and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide) (

Greenway, 2015

) (

Figure 8.3

). These changes can persist at least up to 1 year.




Recall that leptin is an appetite-suppressing (anorexigenic) hormone primarily secreted by adipose tissue. Conversely, ghrelin is an appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) hormone secreted primarily by endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Given the respective roles of leptin and ghrelin, it would be expected that in obese individuals, pre–weight loss leptin levels would be decreased and ghrelin levels increased. Precisely, the opposite is true. Obese individuals exhibit high levels of leptin and low levels of ghrelin. Obese individuals seem to be leptin resistant—exhibiting high levels of leptin whose function is blocked. At the same time, obese individuals seem to be overly sensitive to ghrelin, and the decreased levels may represent a physiological adaptation to the positive energy balance of obesity (

Huda et al., 2006

;
 
Klok et al., 2007

). Leptin levels are reduced within 24 hr of energy restriction. These reductions appear to trigger a “starvation defense response” despite the availability of abundant fat stores. Exercise training protocols that result in reduced fat mass are also generally accompanied by lower leptin concentrations (

Bouassida et al., 2010

). The result is a reduction in metabolic rate and physical activity (hence lower-energy expenditure), increased hunger, reduced thyroid metabolism, and diminished sympathetic activity (

Ochner et al., 2013

;
 
Rosenbaum et al., 2005

).




When an individual loses weight, ghrelin levels increase. Conversely, ghrelin levels decrease when anorexia nervosa patients gain weight. These opposing responses suggest that ghrelin levels change in response to energy intake variations to maintain the current body weight. Increasing ghrelin, therefore, might be a compensation for weight loss, making maintenance of that loss difficult (

Hansen et al., 2002

;
 
Klok et al., 2007

;
 
Leidy et al., 2007b

;
 
Romon et al., 2006

). The good news is that the rise in ghrelin with weight loss may be transient and may eventually decrease with weight maintenance if that can be achieved. In a randomized clinical trial using diet, exercise, and the weight loss drug orlistat, a group of obese females lost 8.5% of their body weight in 6 months. They had the expected rise in ghrelin. However, when they maintained their weight loss for 6 months, their ghrelin levels returned to baseline (

Garcia et al., 2006

). Thus, ghrelin may be a counterregulatory mechanism in the short but not long term. In addition, a low-fat diet seems to have an inhibitory effect on ghrelin levels (

Klok et al., 2007

). Protein consumption results in ghrelin suppression over a long period of time. Carbohydrate consumption results in an initial suppression of ghrelin more than protein, but then, ghrelin rebounds to a higher than baseline level within hours (

Foster-Schubert et al., 2008

). Despite the importance of leptin, ghrelin, and insulin, the changes that have been reported in studies have not been found in and of themselves to predict weight regain following weight loss (Strohacker et al., 2014).




Both PYY and CCK promote satiety. Thus, their reduction potentially encourages formerly obese individuals to overeat (

Ochner et al., 2013

). Reduced thyroid hormone (T3) results in decreased thermogenesis (discussed below) and overall metabolic rate (

Trexler et al., 2014

)

.




Adaptive thermogenesis
 An adaptive decrease in (or suppression of) thermogenesis indicates a change in the efficiency of energy utilization that results in a reduction of energy expenditure in any or all components of TEE including TEF, resting, nonexercise, and exercise expenditure. The composition of the diet used for weight loss may influence subsequent weight gain. Low-fat diets tend to decrease TEE and RMR more than low-carbohydrate diets (

Greenway, 2015

).




Maintenance of ≥10% reduction in body weight in either lean or obese individuals is accompanied by approximately 20–25% decline in a 24-hour TEE. This decline in weight maintenance calories is 10–15% below what is predicted based solely in the accompanying alterations in FFM and FM. Thus, a formerly obese individual would require approximately 300–400 fewer calories per day to maintain the same body weight/composition and physical activity level as a never-obese individual of the same body weight/composition (Rosenbaum and Leibel, 2010;
 
Trexler et al., 2014

).




As described earlier, the TEF depends on macronutrient and caloric content of the food ingested. When caloric input goes down in dieting, so does the TEF. Further, as was seen in the Focus on Research box, the TEM decreases with a reduction in body weight. The adaptive decrease in TEF indicates a change in food efficiency.
 Food efficiency
 is an index of the number of calories an individual needs to ingest to maintain a given weight or percent body fat. Food efficiency
 increases
 when the calories needed to sustain a certain weight (or percent fat) decrease. This response could be protective if food were scarce. Food efficiency
 decreases
 when the number of calories needed to sustain a certain weight (or percent fat) increases. Being able to eat more to maintain a given weight is what every dieter would like to have happen, but which does not happen (

Brodie, 1988

).






Food Efficiency
 An index of the number of calories an individual needs to ingest to maintain a given weight or percent body fat.





A residual reduction (adaptive decrease) in RMR is well documented but not universally shown, in part because of wide differences among individuals. The impact on RMR is particularly important because it accounts for the highest percentage of daily energy expenditure. When 12 studies were combined in a traditional meta-analysis, relative RMR was 5.1% lower in the formerly obese group than the control group. The authors concluded that the cause of the lower RMR remained unknown; however, the implication was clear. A low RMR is likely to contribute to the formerly obese individual’s difficulty in maintaining a weight loss (

Astrup et al., 1999

).




As stated in the last section, many, but not all, studies show a clear trend for a decrement in NEAT (nonexercise activity such as fidgeting or normal daily activities) during a period of energy deficit. This decrement persists after individuals return to a free choice diet and are simply trying to maintain the weight loss unfortunately making this goal more difficult to achieve (

Trexler et al., 2014

).




Finally, an adaptive decrease in exercise energy expenditure has also been documented (

Greenway, 2015

;
 
Major et al., 2007

;
 
Trexler et al., 2014

). Several studies involving dietary and activity analysis indicate that some female distance runners ingest only between 1,400 and 1,990 kcal·d
−1
 while training as much as 65 mi·wk
−1
. These caloric intake values are much lower than those for comparably sized, inactive females of the same age (

Brownell et al., 1987

). Similar discrepancies have been shown in obese adult males walking on the treadmill (

Doucet et al., 2003

).




Part of this decrease in energy expenditure may be related to changes in uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3). UCP3 is similar to UCP1 in that it separates oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat. UCP1 is found in BAT and beige tissue; UCP3 is located primarily in skeletal muscle mitochondria. Decreases in UCP3 have been documented in humans in response to energy restriction and as such could potentially play a role in decreasing energy expenditure. Individuals identified as “diet resistant” have shown decreased UCP3 activity compared to “diet-responsive” subjects during maintenance of a reduced bodyweight (

Trexler et al., 2014

).





Making Weight for Sport




Although athletes in many sports are concerned with maintaining a low body weight and/or a low-percent body fat, only a few sports organize the competition around weight classes. The original intention was to make the competitions as fair as possible by matching individuals of approximately the same size. However, in practice, many participants manipulate their body weight to drop down to a lower-weight class on the assumption that they will then have a physical and psychological advantage over their opponents. One wonders, however, what possible advantage there can be when both competitors are following the same strategy (although each athlete will always think he or she can drop down more than his or her opponent) and, more importantly, the health and performance implications are ignored. Despite these concerns, dropping into a lower-weight class is routinely done, often by individuals in their growth years. Boxers, wrestlers, rowers, martial arts athletes, judo participants (judokas), and jockeys all engage in making weight, but by far, most research attention involves wrestlers (Figure 8.15
).









FIGURE 8.15
 Making Weight by Following Sound Scientific Guidelines Should Be an Important Goal for Wrestlers at All Levels of Competition.





The
 
American College of Sports Medicine (1996)

 has published several versions of the “Position Stand on Weight Loss in Wrestlers,” the latest in 1996. The techniques typically used by wrestlers and the physiological consequences were detailed in the 1976 version, as well as suggestions for “making weight” in a healthier manner. Unfortunately, these early recommendations appear to have had little impact on the patterns of weight loss

 and regain in wrestlers. In 1997, in one 5-week period, three collegiate wrestlers died from complications caused by rapid weight loss (

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998

). These tragedies brought about rule changes from the NCAA (and adopted by many high school associations). These changes and regulations included adding 7 lb to each weight class, moving weigh-ins to 1 hour before the competition; requiring preseason assessment of body composition, hydration, and weight by a member of the school’s athletic medical staff; a minimal weight for each wrestler; and regulation of weight loss/gain. The raw data from the preseason assessments are entered into the online National Wrestling Coaches Association Optimal Performance Calculator. An ideal minimal competition weight and a safe weight loss/gain plan are established, and athletes are assigned to daily nutrient goals based on their weight loss/gain plan. This plan mandates that a wrestler may not lose more than 1.5% of body weight per week while descending to the lowest certified weight class. The ACSM guidelines of not less than 7% BF for male competitors younger than 16 years and not less than 5% BF for males 16 years or older are part of this mandated plan. Female wrestlers are required to have a minimum of 12–14% BF. Total body weight loss cannot exceed 7%. The use of laxatives, emetics, excessive fluid and food restriction, self-induced vomiting, hot environments (including practice rooms of >80°F), saunas, steam rooms, diuretics, vapor-impermeable suits, and intravenous rehydration are prohibited (

National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2007

;
 
Khodaee et al., 2015; Rosenfeld, 2014

). Hydrostatic (underwater) weighing, displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod), and skinfolds using the
 
Lohman (1981)

 equation are approved by the NCAA. Several high school associations allow bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as well, although BIA has been shown to have a high prediction error in wrestlers and research indicates that skinfolds and BIA body composition values cannot be used interchangeably (

Clark et al., 2002

,
 
2005

).




The Lohman skinfold equation is as follows:











Example






If a 17-year-old wrestler weighs 165 lb and his sum of skinfolds for the selected sites is 46 mm, the calculation would be











The D
B
 value is then substituted into the age-appropriate formula presented in
 
Table 7.1

 in
 
Chapter 7

 for a male adolescent to determine %BF. For a 17-year-old, this is












Equations 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 are then used to determine the wrestler’s most appropriate competitive weight. Using Equation 7.4,












Using Equation 7.5,












Note:
 16% is used here as the desirable %BF, not 5%, which is the lowest recommended %BF for a wrestler of this age. The 16.3% complies with the recommendation that weight loss not exceed 7% of body weight.








To get down to 5% BF, this wrestler would need to lose 18.3% of his body weight, and that is too much. Using Equation 7.6,












To achieve his recommended body weight, this wrestler needs to lose 13.7 lb.








Specific guidelines for making weight have not been established for other sports, but the principles discussed here can and should be applied.

Several studies have investigated compliance with the new regulations. A 1999 survey of 43 collegiate teams (

Oppliger et al., 2003

) found that the most weight lost during the season was 6.9% of body weight, but average weekly weight loss was 4.3%. Although 40.2% indicated that the then-new NCAA rules deterred extreme weight loss behaviors, approximately 55% fasted, approximately 28% used saunas, and approximately 27% used vapor barrier suits at least once a month. Overall, however, compared to college wrestlers in the 1980s, weight behavior was less extreme. A follow-up study (

Oppliger et al., 2006

) of 811 competitors in Division I, II, and III national championship tournaments from 1999 to 2004 showed that weight and %BF decreased from preseason to postseason competition. However, the preseason certified minimum weight remained unchanged (68.0 ± 9.2 kg vs. 67.9 ± 9.1 kg), thus showing good agreement between the preseason recommendations and the actual end-of-season weights. Rapid weight loss before weigh-in was found to be statistically significant but small (~1.7% of body weight). The average wrestlers at the tournaments were competing at 9.5% BF, down from the preseason average of 12.3 ± 3.4%, but well above the minimum of 5%. The investigators concluded that the NCAA weight management program appears to be effective in reducing unhealthy weight-cutting behaviors (although the wrestlers were not asked how they achieved weight goals) and promoting competitive equity.




This is an example of very successful cooperation between science and sport for the benefit of the participants, but it needs to be extended to all levels and types of wrestling and modified appropriately for use in all weight-category sports.





SUMMARY





1.
 Weight gain, loss, and stabilization follow the First Law of Thermodynamics as expressed in the caloric balance equation. The components of this equation are food ingestion (+), resting or basal metabolic rate (−), thermogenesis (−), and exercise (−).




2.
 Diet, acute exercise, and exercise training can have an impact on the components of the caloric balance equation.




3.
 The goal of weight or fat control should be to lose body fat (especially visceral abdominal fat), to preserve fat-free weight (FFW), to maintain or improve health, and for athletes to maintain or improve performance.




4.
 The theoretical 3,500-kcal·lb
−1
 rule significantly overestimates the size of weight loss in practice.




5.
 Body weight loss from very low (ingesting 400–800 kcal·d
−1
) and low (ingesting 800–1,200 kcal·d
−1
) dietary restriction is approximately 75% BF and 25% FFW; from a moderate intake diet (1,200–1,500 kcal·d
−1
), the split is approximately 90% BF and 10% FFW.




6.
 Body weight loss from exercise alone rarely is as much as from diet alone, probably because of insufficient energy expenditure, compensatory decreases in nonexercise energy expenditure, or an increase in unrestricted energy intake. When these factors are controlled, weight loss from exercise alone will not differ from diet alone. More FFW is preserved when weight is lost using exercise alone than diet alone.




7.
 A combination of diet plus exercise is the preferred technique for body composition and body weight control both to accomplish an initial loss and to maintain a weight loss.




8.
 The exercise training component of weight and fat control should include both an aerobic endurance portion (to expend 1,200–2,000 kcal·wk
−1
) and a resistance weight training portion (to maintain and/or build FFW).




9.
 Under the same energy deficit, there are wide individual differences in body weight/fat loss. Possible reasons include (1) lack of compliance, (2) overestimation of weight/fat loss based on the theoretical 3,500-kcal·lb
−1
 rule, (3) a reduction in NEAT, (4) a compensatory increase in energy intake, and/or (5) adaptive thermogenesis.




10.
 Difficulty in maintaining weight/fat loss may be linked to (1) lack of compliance, (2) altered enzymatic and hormonal functions, and/or (3) adaptive thermogenesis.




11.
 Proper weight for all sports should be determined based on %BF and safe weight loss procedures.
