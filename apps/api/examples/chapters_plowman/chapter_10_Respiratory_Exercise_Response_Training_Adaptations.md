Introduction





During exercise, the demand for energy increases. The demand varies, of course, with the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise. In most exercise situations, much of the body’s ability to respond to the demand for more energy depends on the availability of oxygen. To provide the needed oxygen for aerobic energy production, the respiratory system—including pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration—must respond. Pulmonary ventilation increases to enhance alveolar ventilation, external respiration adjusts to maintain the relationship between ventilation and perfusion in most cases, and internal respiration responds with an increased extraction of oxygen by the muscles. These changes in respiration not only provide adequate oxygenation for the muscles but also play a major role in maintaining acid-base balance, which is, in turn, closely related to carbon dioxide levels.



In general, all levels of respiratory activity are precisely matched to the rate of work being done. Furthermore, because of this precise control and the large reserve built into the system, respiration in normal, healthy, sedentary, or moderately fit individuals is generally not a limiting factor in activity. This is true despite the perception of feeling out of breath during exercise. Occasionally, however, the capacities of the cardiovascular and metabolic systems exceed that of the respiratory system such that respiration can be considered a limitation to primarily high-intensity or maximal work and, paradoxically, that happens most frequently, but not exclusively, in elite highly trained athletes.




Of course, changes in pulmonary ventilation would be of little benefit if parallel changes in pulmonary blood volume and flow and total body systemic circulation did not also occur. These accompanying cardiovascular responses will be detailed in the chapters in the cardiovascular unit.




This chapter concentrates on pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration responses to aerobic activity, including short- and long-term, constant-load submaximal activity and incremental exercise to maximum. The most prominent changes in the respiratory system occur within these classifications of activity. Static exercise responses will also be briefly discussed. However, respiratory responses to dynamic resistance activity and high-intensity anaerobic exercise have not been specifically documented and therefore cannot be discussed here. When reading this discussion and studying the accompanying graphs, you may wish to refer to the glossary of respiratory symbols in
 
Table 10.1

. Note that several variables are involved in more than one process.

Response of the Respiratory System to Exercise




Short-Term, Light to Moderate Submaximal Aerobic Exercise


The responses to short-term (5–10 minutes), light to moderate submaximal (30–69% of maximal work capacity) aerobic exercise are shown in Figures 10.1
, 10.2
. and 10.5
. These responses are discussed in detail in the following subsections.

Pulmonary Ventilation


The most obvious response to an increased metabolic demand, such as exercise, is the increase in pulmonary minute ventilation (

 L·min−1
), called hyperpnea. What is perhaps a little surprising is the initial immediate reaction. In Figure 10.1A
, note that between the onset of exercise at 0 and 2 minutes into the exercise, a triphasic response in 

 occurs. Within the first respiratory cycle at the onset of exercise, there is an initial abrupt increase in 

, termed phase 1. This increase is
 maintained for approximately 10–20 seconds. Phase 2 is a slower exponential rise from the initial elevation to a steady-state leveling off. At the low to moderate workload depicted here, this exponential rise is generally completed in 2–3 minutes. At this point, phase 3, a new steady state, is achieved. The actual level of this achieved exercise steady state depends on a number of factors, including the workload, the fitness status of the individual, and the environmental conditions. In the time span depicted in this graph, the steady-state level is maintained. The three-phase response at the onset of activity is typically not seen when 

 is reported or graphed minute by minute, rather than second by second or even breath by breath, but it does occur (Bell, 2006
; Pardy et al., 1984
; Whipp, 1977
; Whipp and Ward, 1980
; Whipp et al., 1982
).



The initial rise in ventilation occurs primarily because of an increase in tidal volume (

Leff and Schumacker, 1993

). Theoretically, tidal volume ranges from the resting level to the limits of vital capacity (VC). In reality, rarely is more than 50–65% of  VC reached before a plateau occurs. Furthermore, although tidal volume encroaches into both the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) and the expiratory reserve volume (ERV), it encroaches much more into IRV than ERV (

Koyal et al., 1976

;
 
Pearce and Milhorn, 1977

;
 
Turner et al., 1968

;
 
Younes and Kivinen, 1984

).




At light to moderate workloads, the contribution of increased breathing frequency to minute ventilation is minimal and gradual. Both tidal volume and frequency level off at a steady state that satisfies the oxygen requirements of the short submaximal activity (

Figure 10.1B and C

).




Airway resistance decreases because of bronchodilation as soon as exercise begins. Likewise, the ratio of dead space (V
D
) to tidal volume (V
T
) decreases, and in this case, the largest changes are evident at the lowest work rate (

Wasserman et al., 1967

;
 
Whipp and Ward, 1980

). This result is shown in
 
Figure 10.1B

. The depth of the drop in V
D
/V
T
 is moderate at low to moderate exercise intensities. The V
D
 itself changes minimally with bronchodilation, but with the proportionally larger increase in V
T
, the ratio declines (

Grimby, 1969

). This result is important because alveolar ventilation (


) thus increases from about 70% of the total pulmonary ventilation at rest to a higher percentage during exercise. Since
 

 is the critical ventilation, this reduction in the V
D
/V
T
 ratio means that the appropriate level of
 

 can be achieved with a smaller rise in
 

 than would be needed if the ratio did not change (

Wasserman and Whipp, 1975

).



External Respiration


The 

 response to low to moderate exercise is depicted in Figure 10.2A
. This curve parallels the change in 

, except that the initial adjustments seen in 

 are not depicted for 

. The rise in 

 is sufficient to maintain PO2
 at the alveolar level (PA
O2
) during short-term submaximal exercise (Figure 10.2B
). Maintenance of PA
O2
 is important because it represents the driving force for oxygen transfer across the alveolar-capillary interface (Powers et al., 1993
; Wasserman, 1978
).



As explained in Chapter 9, under resting conditions, there is a difference in PO
2
 between the alveoli (P
A
O
2
) and systemic arterial blood (PaO
2
) owing to the dilution of the systemic arterial blood with the bronchial venous blood. During short-term, low-intensity submaximal exercise, PaO
2
 is maintained. The alveolar to arterial oxygen partial pressure difference, depicted as (A-a)PO
2
diff in
 
Figure 10.2C

, either does not change or decreases slightly

 (

 Jones, 1975

;
 
Leff and Schumacker, 1993

;
 
Wasserman and Whipp, 1975

). At moderate workloads, a slight increase may occur. The (A-a)PO
2
diff reflects the efficiency and/or adequacy of oxygen transfer in the lungs during exercise. At the steady-state submaximal levels described here, there is no noticeable change in this efficiency.




Gas exchange and blood perfusion in the lungs during low to moderate exercise are sufficient to maintain the saturation of red blood cells with oxygen (SaO
2
%) within a narrow range approximating resting levels (

Figure 10.2D

) (

Gurtner et al., 1975

).



Internal Respiration


Recall that internal respiration involves the dissociation of oxygen from the red blood cells so that it may diffuse down the pressure gradient into the muscles and other tissues.



Refer to
 
Figure 10.3

 and refamiliarize yourself with the resting relationships for oxygen dissociation described in
 
Chapter 9

 and labeled in this figure. The perpendicular line on the x-axis at 95 mmHg represents the PaO
2
 for resting arterial blood. It intersects with the middle curve and indicates a percent saturation of hemoglobin (SbO
2
%) of approximately 97% (seen on the left y-axis). The perpendicular line on the x-axis at 40 mmHg represents the PvO
2
 for resting venous blood. This line also intersects with the middle curve and indicates a SbO
2
 of 75%; that is, at rest, 75% of the oxygen remains associated with the red blood cells in venous blood. Thus, much more oxygen could be extracted at the tissue capillary level and normally is during exercise.










FIGURE 10.3
 Oxygen Dissociation during Exercise.
 The center curve represents normal resting values: PaCO2
 = 40 mmHg, pH = 7.4, body temperature = 37°C. During all intensities and types of exercise, the PaCO2
 increases, pH decreases (becomes more acidic), and body temperature increases. Each of these conditions causes the curve to shift to the right, with the result that more oxygen is dissociated from red blood cells to be used by the muscles. Consequently, the higher the intensity of exercise, the lower both the oxygen content of the venous blood and the SbO2
% in venous blood.





Four factors are involved in the increased oxygen extraction during exercise:




1.
 Increased PO
2
 gradient




2.
 Increased PCO
2




3.
 Decreased pH




4.
 Increased temperature




Each of these factors is depicted in the oxygen dissociation curve in
 
Figure 10.3

. The first factor, an increased PO
2
 gradient (seen along the x-axis), occurs as more oxygen is used to produce the additional energy needed during exercise. Factors 2, 3, and 4 (an increased PCO
2
, decreased pH, and increased temperature) all cause the oxygen dissociation curve to shift to the right. This shift is indicated in
 
Figure 10.3

 by the arrow pointing to the right-hand curve. As the oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the right, more oxygen is extracted for any given PO
2
. How each factor operates specifically to increase oxygen extraction is described below.



INCREASED PO2 GRADIENT Under resting conditions, sufficient oxygen remains in the muscle tissue to maintain a PO2
 of 40 mmHg. When exercise increases the demand for energy, the oxygen already present in the muscle tissue is used immediately. Since the oxygen
 is used, the muscle tissue partial pressure is reduced correspondingly. The PO2
 of arterial blood remains unchanged. Therefore, the pressure gradient can widen from 55 mmHg (95 mmHg at the arterial end of the capillary minus 40 mmHg in the muscle tissue) up to possibly 65 mmHg (95 mmHg at the arterial end of the capillary minus 30 mmHg in the muscle tissue) during light submaximal exercise.



Equilibrium is reached between the muscle tissue and the blood by the venous end of the capillary, so the returning venous blood also has the lower PO
2
. Refer to
 
Figure 10.3

 and find the line labeled submaximal for venous blood during exercise above the x-axis value of 30 mmHg. Assume for the moment that this is the only change that occurs (a false assumption, as will be seen later, but which does no harm here). In the figure, you can see the effect this increased pressure gradient has on the dissociation of oxygen. By following this submaximal exercise line to where it intersects the solid line middle curve and then to the left y-axis, you can see that the corresponding SbO
2
% (actually SvO
2
% now) is approximately 59%, not 75%. Instead of 23% of the oxygen being dissociated as it was at rest (97% SaO
2
% − 75% SvO
2
% = 22%; 22% ÷ 97% = 23%), now 38% (97% SaO
2
% − 59 SvO
2
% = 38%; 37% ÷ 97% = 39%) has been released from the red blood cells just because of the change in the pressure gradient. Thus, an additional 16% of the available oxygen (39% − 23% = 16%) has been dissociated and is used for energy production. Because all submaximal exercise does not require the same amount of oxygen, these numbers simply illustrate the effect of a widening pressure gradient.



INCREASED PCO2 When oxygen is used to provide energy, carbon dioxide is produced as a by-product. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide mean that PCO2
 increases. An increase in PCO2
 shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. This shift occurs in a minimal way even at rest, as seen in the venous curve in Figure 9.18
. However, during exercise, the shift is further to the right. Exactly how far the curve shifts depends on the intensity of the exercise and how much carbon dioxide is produced. The shift in the curve to the right means that at any given PO2
, more dissociation occurs, as shown in Figure 10.3
. Follow the line for venous blood during exercise from the value of 30 mmHg on the PO2
 x-axis until it intersects the right-hand curve. A horizontal line from this intersection to the left y-axis yields a saturation value of about 41%. Thus, more oxygen is dissociated than would have been if the pressure gradient had been operating alone. Figure 10.4
 emphasizes that the actual shift occurs during the red blood cell transit through the capillary before reaching the venous blood vessel.









FIGURE 10.4
 Factors Influencing Oxygen Dissociation during Exercise.
 The by-products of the production of energy—namely, carbon dioxide, heat, and hydrogen ions (H+
)—in skeletal muscle fibers stimulate the dissociation of oxygen from red blood cells as they traverse systemic capillaries.




DECREASED PH OR INCREASED HYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION Hydrogen ions (H+
) come from two primary sources during exercise. First, carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then breaks down into hydrogen ions and
 bicarbonate. Second, lactic acid breaks down into lactate and hydrogen ions. The presence of increased levels of hydrogen ions lowers the pH to a more acidic level. This more acidic pH shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right in the same way that an increased PCO2
 does and with the same results: a greater dissociation of oxygen from red blood cells. How far to the right the curve shifts depends on the amount of hydrogen ions released. As with carbon dioxide, this effect is taking place during the red blood cell’s transit through the muscle capillaries (Figure 10.4
). The interactive effect of carbon dioxide and pH on the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is known as the Bohr effect
 (Hall, 2016
; Kenney, 1982
).


Increased Temperature Another by-product of muscle energy production is heat. Heat is transferred from the muscle tissue (high heat) to the capillary (low heat) (Figure 10.4
). The resultant rise in temperature shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. The action is precisely the same as that of the increased PCO2
 and decreased pH, and so it is again depicted by the same shift in Figure 10.3
. Thus, the elevation in the use of oxygen to produce energy during exercise and the by-products of that energy production operate together to make the reserves of oxygen available: the first (increased oxygen consumption) by widening the pressure gradient and the other three (increased PCO2
, decreased pH, and increased body temperature) by shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right.



The exercise responses for the variables from the oxygen dissociation curve are depicted in
 
Figure 10.5

. The best overall indicator of internal respiration is the arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO
2
diff) (

Gurtner et al., 1975

). Because PaO
2
 (

Figure 10.5A

) and SaO
2
% (

Figure 10.2D

) do not change with short-term, low-intensity exercise, the actual amount of oxygen being carried in the arteries (in milliliters per deciliter) also does not change (

Wasserman et al., 1967

). However, because energy production uses more oxygen even at these low intensities, the venous oxygen value, PvO
2
 (

Figure 10.5C

), and SvO
2
% (

Figure 10.5F

) decrease. With an equal arterial oxygen and lower venous oxygen content, the a-vO
2
diff (

Figure 10.5E

) increases. Because this is a steady-state submaximal situation, the a-vO
2
diff will level off when sufficient oxygen is being extracted to supply the needs of the cell (

Davies et al., 1972

;
 
Dempsey et al., 1977

;
 
Kao, 1974

).

Because energy production also produces carbon dioxide, it would be anticipated that the PvCO
2
 would increase. As shown in
 
Figure 10.5D

, this increase does occur, but it is not particularly large at these low to moderate workloads. The extra carbon dioxide is exhaled easily from the lungs, and the hyperpnea of exercise may even blow off a little extra carbon dioxide, resulting in a slight decrement in PaCO
2
 (

Figure 10.5B

). Regulation of ventilation maintains PaCO
2
 very close to resting values (

Davies et al., 1972

;
 
Dempsey et al., 1977

;
 
Kao, 1974

;
 
Wasserman et al., 1967

;
 
Whipp and Ward, 1980

).




These combined responses are well within the reserve capacity of the respiratory system for normal, healthy individuals.



Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Aerobic Exercise


If submaximal aerobic exercise is increased in duration and maintained at high-moderate to heavy intensity (60–75% of maximal working capacity), respiratory responses vary primarily in magnitude compared with the changes just discussed for short-term, light to moderate submaximal exercise. In addition, several of the variables have a drifting pattern.


Pulmonary Ventilation



Figure 10.6A
 shows that 

 increases to a higher level than during light to moderate submaximal exercise before plateauing at a steady state. Achievement of the steady state may take somewhat longer than at lower work intensities and often is not held throughout the duration of the exercise. Note that after about 30 minutes, a gradual rise in 

 occurs, despite an unchanging workload, an effect called ventilatory drift
 (Dempsey et al., 1977
; Hanson et al., 1982
; Wasserman, 1978
). The precise reason for this drift is
 unknown (Sawka et al., 1980
), although a rising body temperature is most often speculated as the primary reason. This drift is both inefficient and advantageous. It is inefficient because the extra air breathed is in excess of the workload demand. It is advantageous for gas exchange because alveolar ventilation parallels the drift, and acid-base balance is maintained (Dempsey et al., 1977
; Hanson et al., 1982
).

 Minute ventilation (V.E
). B.
 Tidal volume (VT
) and ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD
/VT
). C.
 Frequency.





As for lower-intensity submaximal exercise, the initial change in
 

 is due primarily to an increase in V
T
 (

Figure 10.6B

). However, in the later stages of heavy submaximal work, tidal volume may decrease slightly. The drift in
 

 comes about primarily as a result of increased breathing frequency (

Figure 10.6C

). The V
D
/V
T
 ratio (

Figure 10.6B

) still decreases primarily at the onset of activity, but it does so to a greater extent with a heavier workload than at lighter loads. After about an hour of heavy submaximal work, the V
D
/V
T
 ratio may increase very slightly.



External Respiration


As stated earlier, the drift in 

 is paralleled by a similar drift in 

 (Figure 10.7A
). PA
O2
 remains constant (Figure 10.7B
),
 as it did with lower-intensity submaximal work. However, PaO2
 decreases gradually but slightly until about the time when ventilatory drift occurs, forming a shallow U-shaped curve (Dempsey et al., 1977
). It then returns toward baseline values. This variation in PaO2
 while PA
O2
 remains unchanged is reflected in a mirror image relationship in the (A-a)PO2
diff (Figure 10.7C
), depicted as a truncated, inverted U-shaped curve. The initial increase in the (A-a)PO2
diff indicates inefficiency in gas exchange. However, the small loss of efficiency seen here has very little practical meaning and does not limit the exercise (Hanson et al., 1982
; Wasserman et al., 1967
).

Internal Respiration


Other than differences in magnitude, all of the internal respiration variables respond in the same way during long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal dynamic exercise as during shorter, lighter dynamic exercise, as previously described.



Despite the higher workload and the shallow U-shaped response, PaO
2
 is relatively constant (

Figure 10.8A

). Because of the heavier workload, more oxygen is dissociated and used, and the PvO
2
 (

Figure 10.8C

) and SvO
2
% (

Figure 10.8F

)

 decrease to lower levels than in shorter, lighter workloads. The result is a widening of the a-vO
2
diff (

Figure 10.8E

). The factors responsible for the dissociation of oxygen are the same as those for lower-intensity exercise. PaCO
2
 (

Figure 10.8B

) decreases slightly due to the increased volume of air being exhaled. PvCO
2
 (

Figure 10.8D

) increases because the greater use of oxygen to produce energy also results in more carbon dioxide being carried in the venous system to the lungs to be exhaled.

Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum


Incremental aerobic exercise to maximum consists of a series of progressively increasing work intensities, which stop when the individual cannot do any more work. The length of each work intensity, often called a stage, generally varies from 1 to 3 minutes to allow for the achievement of a steady state at that level, at least until the higher workloads, when a steady state cannot be either attained or maintained
.


Pulmonary Ventilation


It might be anticipated, because 

 rises and levels off at submaximal workloads, that this rise would be proportional, direct, and rectilinear throughout the entire range from rest to maximal exercise. However, as shown in Figure 10.9A
, the response is not a smooth rise. At light to moderate and even heavy intensities, up to approximately 50–75% of maximum workload, 

 does increase in a rectilinear fashion. At this point, a break in the linearity occurs, and a second, steeper linear rise ensues. This proportional rise continues until approximately 85–95% of maximum workload, when a second break in linearity occurs. The slope of the third linear rise to maximum that follows is even steeper (Koyal et al., 1976
; Powers and Beadle, 1985
; Wasserman, 1978
). These points where the rectilinear rise in minute ventilation breaks from linearity during incremental exercise to maximum have had a variety of names. The first breakpoint has been called the “point of optimal ventilatory efficiency” reflecting the point at which a maximum amount of oxygen can be taken up with a minimum of ventilation. The second breakpoint is often called the “respiratory compensation point” reflecting a relative hyperventilation (Binder et al., 2008
). However, in this text, we use the most acceptable simple terminology that does not imply causation, that is, ventilatory thresholds
. The first breakpoint is called the first ventilatory threshold (VT1), and the second breakpoint is called the second ventilatory threshold (VT2).

Ventilatory Thresholds
 Points where the rectilinear rise in minute ventilation breaks from linearity during an incremental exercise to maximum.





Precisely what causes these breakpoints is unknown. One theory has linked ventilatory breakpoints with an excess of carbon dioxide resulting from the buffering of lactic acid; this theory calls the breakpoints anaerobic thresholds. Although carbon dioxide is a known respiratory stimulator, this theory is probably not completely accurate (for reasons that are fully discussed in the unit on metabolism). Therefore, the term “ventilatory threshold” is preferable. Other possible mechanisms—including catecholamine or potassium stimulation of the carotid bodies; limitations in changes in V
T
, frequency, and V
D
/V
T
 to maintain
 

; increasing body temperatures; and feedback from the skeletal muscle proprioceptors—have been suggested as causes of the VTs, but their role remains unproven. A combination of factors likely is responsible (

Loat and Rhodes, 1993

;
 
Skinner and McLellan, 1980

;
 
Walsh and Banister, 1988

).




Knowledge of the VTs, regardless of why they occur, has some practical benefit. The workloads at which the VTs occur are related to endurance exercise training and performance. VT1 is thought to indicate the upper boundary of moderate exercise and VT2 to separate heavy but sustainable exercise intensity from very heavy nonsustainable intensity. This means that VT1 and VT2 can be used for exercise prescription. That is, training at work rates between VT1 and VT2 would stimulate aerobic metabolism but allow for activity of long duration (

Neder and Stein, 2006

). It also means that the VTs can be useful for predicting performance (

Amann et al., 2006

). The higher the workload where the breaks occur, the greater the intensity of activity that can be sustained (

Loat and Rhodes, 1993

;
 
Walsh and Banister, 1988

).




Once again, the changes in minute ventilation (


) during low to moderate workloads are achieved primarily by an increase in V
T
 (

Figure 10.9B

). At very heavy workloads, however, the depth of breathing may actually decrease, forming a truncated, inverted U pattern (

Dempsey, 1986

;
 
Younes and Kivinen, 1984

). When V
T
 reaches its highest point, any further increase in ventilation can occur only as

 the result of an increased breathing frequency (

Wasserman, 1978

). The rise in breathing frequency is exponential at the higher work levels (

Figure 10.9C

). As with submaximal workloads, the V
D
/V
T
 ratio decreases the most in the initial light to moderate stages of the incremental work (

Grimby, 1969

). The maximal reduction is reached at about 60% of maximal work, and this value is maintained to maximum. Since the V
D
/V
T
 ratio is reduced to 0.1 (or 10% of V
T
), 90% of V
T
 is available for exchange at the alveoli (


), providing a more efficient ventilation (

Grimby, 1969

;
 
Jones, 1975

;
 
Wasserman and Whipp, 1975

;
 
Wasserman et al., 1967

).



External Respiration


Changes in 

 parallel the changes in 

, including the slope of the rectilinear rises and the two breakpoints (Figure 10.10A
). The breakpoints in 

, however, occur before the breakpoints in 

—that is, at slightly lower percentages of maximal work (Jones, 1975
; Wasserman, 1978
).

The rise in
 

 is sufficient to maintain P
A
O
2
 and subsequently PaO
2
 through the light to moderate submaximal exercise stages (

Figure 10.10B

). As the workload becomes higher, P
A
O
2
 rises exponentially to maximum. This rise provides the driving force to reach an equilibrium of alveolar gas with mixed venous blood and, in so doing, maintains PaO
2
 and SaO
2
% (solid lines) within narrow limits in normal or moderately fit individuals (

) (

;

2
diff follows the pattern of the exponential rise in P
A
O
2
 (

). The increase of the (A-a)PO
2
diff to approximately 20–25 mmHg shown in

 is considered to be a normal, small increase (

Amann, 2012

;
 
Jones, 1975

).



Internal Respiration


The dissociation or release of oxygen reaches its limit during incremental exercise to maximum. At low and moderate workloads, more and more oxygen is released, as depicted by the sigmoid-shaped curve in Figure 10.3
. The factors that stimulate the dissociation of oxygen during incremental exercise to maximum are the same as previously described, but they typically are greater in magnitude, that is, the pressure gradient is wider, PCO2
 is higher, pH is lower, and temperature is higher as the exercise load increases (Wagner, 1991
). A muscle PO2
 of 3–15 mmHg is considered reasonable for maximal or very heavy dynamic exercise, indicating that almost all of the oxygen can be extracted from the blood perfusing the working muscles. A muscle PO2
 of 15 mmHg has a corresponding pressure gradient of close to 80 mmHg (95 mmHg at the arterial end of the capillary minus 15 mmHg in the muscle tissue). Some oxygen is returned in venous blood. The result is a venous saturation (SvO2
%) of oxygen of approximately 15–35% (Figure 10.11F
), which exerts a partial pressure of 15–25 mmHg (Figure 10.11C
) (Richardson et al., 1995a
, b
; Wagner, 2006
).

As more oxygen is used to produce more energy, more carbon dioxide is produced. This metabolic carbon dioxide—as well as nonmetabolic carbon dioxide produced in the effort to buffer the lactic acid that accumulates at the higher workloads—results in the slightly curvilinear rise in PvCO2
 shown in Figure 10.11D
. Conversely, PaCO2
 (Figure 10.11B
) is maintained at first and then decreases. This fall in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure reflects the excess removal of carbon dioxide brought about by alveolar hyperventilation (Dempsey et al., 1977
; Grimby, 1969
; Jones, 1975
). The a-vO2
diff (Figure 10.11E
) parallels the changes in oxygen dissociation, gradually increasing with the incremental workloads until it can increase no more. It plateaus at approximately 50–60% of the maximal workload (Rowell, 1969
; Saltin, 1969
). Thus, even maximal exercise is well within the respiratory reserves for most individuals.






FOCUS ON APPLICATION: Clinically Relevant






Breathing Patterns during Exercise






Beginning exercisers often ask how and when they should breathe. The best advice for most land exercise appears to be to breathe in whatever pattern comes naturally, whether spontaneously or synchronized with the movement. The primary exception is weight training. The static component of weight training can cause the Valsalva’s maneuver
, a breath-holding action that involves closing of the glottis (which keeps air in the lungs) and contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal musculature. The result is an increase in intra-abdominal pressure and a large increase in blood pressure. Individuals may become light-headed or faint. Blood pressure remains much lower when breathing during the contraction. For this reason, it is generally recommended to inhale during the lowering phase of a resistance exercise and to exhale during the lifting phase of each repetition (Fleck and Kraemer, 2004
; Narloch and Brandstater, 1995
).

Exercise-Induced Arterial Hypoxemia (EIAH)
 A condition in which the amount of oxygen carried in arterial blood is severely reduced by ≥4% consistently.






Respiratory Limitations to Exercise





As has been discussed in the previous sections, the respiratory system of most healthy young to middle-aged individuals is usually not considered a major limiting factor for high-intensity aerobic exercise. The small change in (A-a)PO2
diff indicates an adequate rate of O2
 diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Furthermore, alveolar hyperventilation can increase sufficiently to raise alveolar PA
O2
 high enough to compensate for the widened (A-a)PO2
diff thus maintaining Pa
O2
 with minimal reductions in arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2
%) from light to maximal exercise. Airway resistance and the change in volume per unit change in pressure (compliance) of the lung are maintained close to resting levels. Breathing requires ≤10% of both maximal oxygen consumption and maximal cardiac output and intrathoracic pressure changes approximate only 40–50% of their maximal dynamic capacity in most untrained individuals.



While it might be anticipated that these more than adequate changes with exercise would persist or even improve in a highly trained individual, such is not the case. There are three major situations in which the respiratory system may be inadequate for the task at hand and thus limit high-intensity exercise. These are




1.
 Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia




2.
 Respiratory muscle fatigue




3.
 Excessive fluctuations in intrathoracic pressure (

Amann, 2012

)



Exercise-Induced Arterial Hypoxemia


Refer again to Figure 10.10B–D
. Note the dotted lines, which show steep decreases in PaO2
 and SaO2
% and a steep rise in (A-a)PO2
diff. A decrease of at least 10 mmHg PaO2
 or 4% SaO2
% (if persistent) is called exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH)
. This is a condition in which the amount of oxygen carried in arterial blood is decreased. As shown on the graph in Figures 10.10B
 and 10.11A
, the decline in PaO2
 with EIAH can be considerable, ranging from 18 to 38 mmHg below resting values (96 − 18 = 78 mmHg; 96 − 38 = 58 mmHg). At the same time, the SaO2
% (Figure 10.10D
) is reduced. Mild EIAH is indicated by a SaO2
% of 93–95%, moderate as 88–93%, and severe as less than 88% (Amann, 2012
; Richards et al., 2004
).



Surprisingly, 40–50% of highly trained, healthy, elite male cyclists and runners with
 

 in excess of 4.5 L·min
−1
 or 55 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 exhibit this response at work rates from 60% to 90% of maximum. Even the highly successful Kenyan runners have been shown to experience EIAH (

Foster et al., 2014

). Although most of the original data were collected from elite adult male athletes, there is now evidence of EIAH in females as well as younger and older adult athletes of both sexes (

Prefaut et al., 2000

). Recently, EIAH has also been reported in untrained, low-fit females (

Richards et al., 2004

;
 
Dominelli et al., 2013

) and nonelite sportsmen and sportswomen following high-intensity interval training (

Mucci et al, 2004

). However, no published reports have

 shown EIAH in untrained males. Thus, females may be more prone to developing EIAH than males. The pattern of respiratory changes differs greatly among those who experience EIAH at submaximal exercise intensities (

Dominelli et al., 2013

).




During EIAH, the individual’s ability to process oxygen and therefore to perform high-intensity activity is lower than it would be without EIAH, although both may be higher than in untrained or moderately trained individuals. It has been estimated that
 

 is reduced by approximately 1.5–2% for each 1% reduction in SaO
2
% once the reduction is more than 3% below resting values (

Dempsey and Wagner, 1999

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

). One study tested participants with and without EIAH who had similar
 

 and power outputs (

Legrand et al., 2005

). The EIAH athletes, however, had higher muscle deoxygenation. That is, their working muscles had adapted and were able to compensate, at least to some extent, for the reduced oxygen delivery by extracting more oxygen from what was available. Thus, external respiration may be a limitation for exercise in some individuals with full or partial compensation from internal respiration. Athletes who exhibit EIAH at sea level suffer more severe gas exchange impairments during short-term exposure to higher altitudes than athletes who do not exhibit EIAH at sea level (

Amann, 2012

;
 
Powers et al., 1993

).



What Causes EIAH?


With EIAH, the (A-a)PO2
diff curve increases more than normal as shown by the dotted line increase to 30–50 mmHg in Figure 10.10C
. This excessively widened (A-a)PO2
diff is the most consistent marker and cause of EIAH. It is a definite indication of lack of efficiency in respiration (Romer et al., 2012
; Rowell et al., 1964
; Shapiro et al., 1964
). The widening of (A-a)PO2
diff during exercise has been attributed to a combination of (1) nonuniformity in alveolar ventilation (

) and cardiac output (

) distribution, (2) extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary shunts where red blood cells do not come in contact with oxygen or deoxygenated blood is dumped into the left side of the heart, (3) mechanical constraints on airflow or insensitivity to the ventilatory stimuli associated with exercise, and (4) an alveolar-capillary diffusion disequilibrium as determined by the alveolar-capillary surface area, the diffusion gradient from alveolar to capillary PO2
, and the time available for equilibrium in the pulmonary capillary.



During exercise, there is a small but meaningful increase in the overall nonuniformity of
 

 distribution throughout the lung. Shunting may increase. However, the first critical component resulting in EIAH appears to be diffusion disequilibrium, that is, ventilatory-perfusion inequality (

Hopkins, 2006

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

).




The failure to achieve complete perfusion/diffusion equilibrium may in turn be partially related to a mild, transient extravascular water accumulation and edema, which lengthens the diffusion distance from the alveolar membrane to the red blood cells (

Hodges et al., 2006

;
 
Powers et al., 1993

;
 
Prefaut et al., 2000

;
 
Segal, 1992

). Alternatively, this could be related to the faster transit time of red blood cells through the capillary bed of athletes with a highly developed cardiovascular system. In normal sedentary or moderately trained individuals, pulmonary capillary blood volume increases with exercise. This increases the surface area for diffusion and slows down the red blood cell transit time sufficiently to allow complete diffusion and equilibration of the gases. In highly trained athletes, pulmonary capillary blood volume reaches its maximum at relatively low workloads (

Segal, 1992

). When these elite athletes continue to increase their workloads and total body blood flow, pulmonary capillary volume cannot expand further. Instead, blood flow velocity increases, decreasing red blood cell transit time. As a result, the red blood cell transit time in elite endurance athletes is estimated to be considerably less than that required for gas equilibration (

Foster et al., 2014

;
 
Wagner, 1991

). This creates an imbalance between respiratory ventilation and circulatory perfusion and results in incomplete diffusion equilibrium (

Romer et al., 2012

).




Secondarily, mechanical ventilatory constraints (lung size and airway size/geometry) may prevent adequate increases in external ventilation and compensatory alveolar hyperventilation. Although external ventilation may increase with training, that does not mean that the improvement is sufficient to meet the need. The underlying anatomical factors do not change with training and are typically smaller in females than males (

Dominelli et al., 2013

).




Why EIAH occurs in some individuals and not others has not been determined. Preventive techniques are unknown.



Respiratory Muscle Fatigue


Both respiratory muscle fatigue and excessive fluctuations in intrathoracic pressures can limit cardiac output. These are most evident in sustained high-intensity endurance exercise performance (>85% 

).



High-intensity endurance exercise requires large increases in both inspiratory and expiratory muscle work, often leading to respiratory muscle fatigue. Fatigued respiratory muscles may affect exercise performance via the
 metaboreflex
. That is, metabolites accumulate in the respiratory muscles and activate afferent neurons that transport signals to the brain, which in turn increases sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity in the vasculature of the exercising limbs. This vasoconstriction leads to decreased blood flow and oxygen delivery, peripheral muscle fatigue, increased perception of effort, and ultimately to a decrease in exercise performance

.



Excessive Fluctuations in Intrathoracic Pressures


The ventilatory response during high-intensity exercise is associated with substantial changes in both negative and positive intrathoracic pressures. The normally occurring negative inspiratory intrathoracic pressures associated with high-intensity exercise increase stroke volume. However, when negative pressures are increased beyond these normal levels, no additional increase occurs in stroke volume. Conversely, even small increases in positive intrathoracic pressures with expiration result in a reduced stroke volume. Increases in expiratory positive pressures occur during the transition from moderate to intense exercise in well-trained individuals and/or individuals who develop mechanical expiratory flow limitations during exercise. Since stroke volume times heart rate equals cardiac output, it is possible that the positive pressure changes will outweigh the negative changes and decrease cardiac output. Any limitation in cardiac output contributes to a decrease in blood flow to the exercising limbs and brings about less oxygen delivery. During sustained exercise greater than 85% 

 in a highly trained endurance athlete, the respiratory muscles require up to 15–16% of 

 and cardiac output versus ≤10% in the untrained individual (Amann, 2012
; Dempsey et al., 2008
).


Static Exercise


Static exercise involves the production of force or tension with no mechanical work being done. Therefore, gradations of static exercise are usually expressed relative to the individual’s ability to produce force in a given muscle group (called the maximal voluntary contraction, or MVC) held for a specified period of time. For example, an individual might perform a 30% MVC for 5 minutes.




Figure 4.5

 presents respiratory and metabolic responses to heavy static exercise. Note that, despite this being “heavy” static activity, the rise in
 

 representing energy cost is minimal. As always, pulmonary ventilation (


) increases to provide the needed additional oxygen. At the onset of static exercise, however, the initial (0–2 minutes) three-phase response in
 

 that occurs in aerobic exercise is absent. The a-vO
2
diff either remains the same or decreases slightly during static exercise. This is undoubtedly related to the occlusion of blood flow in statically contracting muscles. For both
 

 and a-vO
2
diff, a rebound rise occurs in recovery. In all other aspects, the respiratory responses are similar in static exercise and in low-intensity, aerobic exercise. Static exercise does not push the reserve capacity of the respiratory system (

Asmussen, 1981

).

Locomotor-Respiratory Coupling (Entrainment) during Exercise



Entrainment
 is defined as frequency and phase locking between two periodic (rhythmic) systems. In some but not all individuals, the performance of rhythmical exercise (such as walking, running, cycling, and rowing) is accompanied by a synchronization of limb movement and breathing frequency, a form of entrainment known as locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC)
 (Hill et al., 1988
; Mahler et al., 1991
; O’Halloran et al., 2012
; Sporer et al., 2007
). For example, an individual may always inhale during the recovery phase of rowing and always exhale during the drive portion of the stroke. Or a walker, runner, or cyclist may always exhale during the push-off phase of one leg or the other. In these patterns, the same number of locomotor movements occurs per breath. Entrainment appears to occur most frequently in experienced runners working at high intensities. Unlike swimming, in which breathing coordination is a function of head placement during the stroke as a learned response, LRC entrainment occurs without conscious thought. Not all individuals entrain during exercise; not all who do entrain use the same pattern. Humans frequently use LRC movements per breath ratios of 2:1, 2.5:1, 3.1, or 4.1, although in running the 2:1 foot strike to breath pattern often predominates (Daley et al., 2013
).





Locomotor-Respiratory Coupling (LRC)
 A form of entrainment that involves the synchronization of limb movement and breathing frequency that accompanies rhythmical exercise.





The precise mechanisms responsible for LRC are not known although mechanical consequences of locomotion (e.g., the impact on internal structures surrounding the respiratory muscles caused by foot strikes) and neural control mechanism including central locomotor control and peripheral feedback (from extremity muscle action) have been suggested (

Daley et al., 2013

;
 
Hoffman et al., 2012

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

).




Entrainment may serve a number of beneficial physiological functions including reducing the work of ventilator muscles, delaying respiratory muscle fatigue, and/or improving respiratory efficiency (

Daley et al., 2013

). Indeed, individuals who entrain naturally have a slightly improved ventilatory efficiency (

Bonsignore et al., 1998

) and a lower-energy cost during exercise when they entrain but not when they breathe randomly. Subjects forced to breathe in specific entrainment patterns rather than being allowed to breathe spontaneously do not exhibit any reduction in energy cost or perceive any less breathing effort with entrained breathing (

Maclennan et al., 1994

). Conversely, an increase in LRC and a corresponding decrease in energy consumption have been shown when individuals were instructed to cycle in cadence with an auditory stimulation whose rhythm corresponded to the preferred limb movement frequency (

Hoffman et al., 2012

).





The Influence of Sex and Age on Respiration at Rest and during Exercise




Male-Female Respiratory Differences


Lung Volumes and Capacities


Values for total lung capacity (TLC) and each of its subdivisions are, on the average, lower for females than males across the entire age span, with the possible exception of around 12–13 years of age, when most girls have had their pubertal growth spurt but boys have not. These differences carry over into the dynamic measurements of maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1
). Part of these differences can be attributed to the smaller size of females. Males, for example, have larger-diameter airways, more alveoli, and larger diffusion surfaces than females. However, even when values are expressed relative to height, weight, or surface area, some differences in lung capacities remain (Åstrand, 1952
; Comroe, 1965
; Ferris et al., 1965
; Harms, 2006
; Loe et al., 2014
).


Pulmonary Ventilation


At rest, there is no consistent difference in breathing frequency between males and females (Malina et al., 2004
). However, at the same submaximal ventilation, females typically display a higher frequency and a lower VT
 than males. This pattern is maintained at maximal exercise (Saris et al., 1985
) (Figure 10.12B
). Ventilatory responsiveness during exercise may be influenced in females by levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone (Harms, 2006
). Males also exhibit higher 

 at most ages than females at maximal exercise, although these differences are narrowed considerably when expressed relative to body weight (Figure 10.12A
) (Åstrand, 1952
, 1960
). Because females have airways that are smaller relative to lung size than males, they are more likely to develop expiratory flow limitations, exhibit an increased elastic load on the inspiratory muscles, and experience more flow-resistive work of breathing than males at increasing exercise intensities. Thus, at a given 

 L⋅min−1
, both the ventilatory work and oxygen cost of breathing are significantly higher for the same-age female as male. Surprisingly, experiments have shown that the inspiratory muscles including the diaphragm of females may fatigue at a slower rate than those of males (Dominelli et al., 2015
; Gonzales and Scheuermann, 2006
; Guenette et al., 2010
; Loe et al., 2014
; Romer et al., 2012
).

External and Internal Respiration


Data to compare males and females are unavailable for most external and internal respiratory measures (Harms, 2006
). The a-vO2
diff has been measured at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise, but the results show little consistency (Åstrand et al., 1964
; Becklake et al., 1965
; Zwiren et al., 1983
). The (A-a)PO2
diff is higher and the PaO2
 is lower in females compared to males at any given level of oxygen utilization. An excessive widening of the (A-a)PO2
diff occurs in EIAH, and females exhibit this condition at least as often as males (Dominelli et al., 2013
; Harms, 2006
). 

 is equal in males and females. The PaCO2
 is slightly lower in females than males at any given 

 (Hopkins and Harms, 2004
; Romer et al., 2012
).


Children and Adolescents


Lung Volumes and Capacities


In general, the TLC and each of its subdivisions increase in a mostly rectilinear pattern for both boys and girls as they progress from about 6 years of age into the late teens or early twenties. The FEV1
 and MVV follow essentially the same incremental pattern in children (Åstrand, 1952
; Åstrand et al., 1963
; Bjure, 1963
; Koyal et al., 1976
; Malina et al., 2004
). From birth to approximately age 10, these changes depend largely on the growth and development of the respiratory system. After that, cell proliferation ceases and hypertrophy of existing structures occurs until maturity. Thus, these changes result primarily but not exclusively from structural enlargement and are strongly related to body height (Bjure, 1963
; Johnson and Dempsey, 1991
). When the subdivisions of TLC are expressed as a percentage of the VT
, the proportions remain the same from about age 8 to age 20. The anatomical dead space increases in proportion to maturity (Ashley et al., 1975
; Robinson, 1938
) and, as in adults, is approximately 1 mL⋅lb−1
 of body weight (Rowland, 2005
).


Pulmonary Ventilation


The control of ventilation is similar in children and adults, except that there is a lower set point of PCO2
 in children than adults (Rowland, 2005
), that is, the respiratory centers of children are more sensitive to CO2
 (Romer et al., 2012
). However, there are some minor differences in 

 and its components across the age span (Zauner et al., 1989
).


REST The 

 at rest is surprisingly consistent regardless of age (Robinson, 1938
). Figure 10.13
 shows that 

 in males varies less than 2 L⋅min−1
 from ages 6 to 76. Comparable data are not available for females. When 

 is expressed relative to body weight, younger boys have a higher 

 than older adolescents or adults, but from adolescence to old age, there is little change in 

.

The remarkably consistent
 

 is achieved differently by children, however, than by older adolescents and adults.

;

T
 than older adolescents and young adults (

).

SUBMAXIMAL EXERCISE Children’s and adolescents’ respiratory responses to exercise are similar to those of
 adults. 

 rises in response to greater oxygen needs at all ages, but it does so faster at the onset of exercise in younger individuals than adults (Rowland, 2005
). The higher 

 in relation to body weight at rest is maintained, as is the variation in how 

 is obtained. That is, children exhibit a higher frequency and lower VT
 at any given submaximal load than adults. They also respond with a higher 

 in relation to body weight at an equal work rate. The ratio of liters of air processed per one liter of oxygen used (

) is called the ventilatory equivalent
. Children and adolescents have a higher ventilatory equivalent at all exercise intensities than adults, indicating that they are hyperventilating. Girls
 hyperventilate more than boys (Rowland, 2005
). These differences are considered negative, indicating a wasteful ventilation, and gradually disappear by late adolescence (Bar-Or, 1983
; Do Prado et al., 2010
; Robinson, 1938
; Rowland, 2005
; Rowland and Green, 1988
; Rowland et al., 1987
). Figure 10.15A and B
 shows differences in frequency (f), VT
, and 

 for 11-year-old girls and boys in comparison to 29-year-old adults (Rowland and Green, 1988
; Rowland et al., 1987
). The speeds are different for males and females, so direct comparison between the sexes cannot be made, but within the sexes, the age differences are similar. In addition to the differences shown in Figure 10.15
, younger children use a marginally lower proportion of their VC during submaximal exercise than adults.

Ventilatory Equivalent

During prolonged submaximal exercise, children and adolescents have the same ventilatory drift as adults, probably in response to a rising core temperature. Nothing in the respiratory response to prolonged exercise would indicate that children are not suited for such activity (

Malina et al., 2004

;
 
Rowland, 2005

).



MAXIMAL EXERCISE In general, children’s responses to maximal exercise parallel the differences seen at rest and during submaximal work rates. The older the child, the higher the 

 that can be achieved in absolute terms. The 

 in relation to body weight gradually declines from about age 7 until adulthood is achieved at about 20 years of age, although in 4- to 6-year-olds, this value is comparable to that of young
 adults (Figure 10.12A
) (Åstrand, 1952
; Åstrand et al., 1963
; Fahey et al., 1979
; Krahenbuhl et al., 1985
; Robinson, 1938
; Rowland, 1990
; Rowland and Green, 1988
). Breathing frequency decreases consistently from the youngest children tested to approximately age 20, while VT
 shows a steady rise over the same time span (Figure 10.12B
). The percentage of VC used as VT
 rises slightly from childhood to young adulthood. The work of breathing is higher in children than in adults and children probably reach respiratory constraints during maximal exercise at lower relative 

 than adults do (Romer et al., 2012
). The 

 gradually declines at maximal work in both boys and girls (Rowland, 2005
). Children also show ventilatory breakpoints during incremental exercise to maximum. Some inconclusive evidence suggests that VT1 and VT2 (expressed as a percentage of 

) are higher in younger children than adults and gradually decline as children mature into adults (Do Prado et al., 2010
; Mahon and Cheatham, 2002
). The physiological mechanisms responsible for the VT1 and VT2 in children are as unclear as they are for adults (Bar-Or, 1983
; Rowland and Green, 1988
).


External and Internal Respiration


Little is known about the changes in gas exchange and transport that occur during normal growth and maturation. The higher frequency and lower VT
 of children in relation to adolescents and adults, at rest and during exercise, seem to be offset by their smaller anatomical dead space. Consequently, 

 is more than adequate at all values of 

 (Bar-Or, 1983
; Malina et al., 2004
; Zauner et al., 1989
).



Pulmonary diffusion during exercise does not appear to differ by age. Likewise, no meaningful aging trends are apparent for P
A
O
2
, PaO
2
, or (A-a)PO
2
diff at rest or during exercise. However, PaO
2
 decreases slightly and the (A-a)PO
2
diff increases slightly as children mature to adulthood (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Eriksson, 1972

;
 
Robinson, 1938

). As a consequence, SaO
2
% is also relatively constant across the age span (

Robinson, 1938

). EIAH is evident in some trained youth as in some adults, and the causes are undoubtedly the same in this age group (

Nourry et al., 2004

;
 
Prefaut et al., 2000

).




The a-vO
2
diff is also very similar at both rest and maximal exercise levels from childhood to maturity. If anything, children may be able to extract about 5% more oxygen during maximal exercise than adults (

Eriksson, 1973

).







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Side Stitches






The “side stitch,” known medically as exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP)
, is a common, poorly understood, generally self-limiting acute abdominal pain that is difficult to treat (Waterman and Kapur, 2012
). Mild ETAP is generally described as cramping, aching, or pulling whereas more severe pain is described as sharp or stabbing. Most stitches occur in the right or left lumbar regions of the abdomen, but occasionally the pain radiates to the shoulder. Although most frequently associated with runners, a high incidence of ETAP has also been reported in other athletes whose sport involves repetitive torso movement and/or jolting such as swimmers and endurance equestrians. Cyclists seem to have a low incidence of ETAP (Morton and Callister, 2000
, 2015
).







Stitches seem to occur more frequently in younger individuals and in individuals with kyphotic or lordotic spinal misalignment (

Morton and Callister, 2010

). Some studies report more incidences of stitch in females than males, but others do not. ETAP is experienced more commonly when starting a new or increased exercise routine, but training/fitness level is not totally protective (

Morton and Callister, 2002

,
 
2015

;
 
Waterman and Kapur, 2012

). The consumption of large amounts of food before or fruit juice that is high in carbohydrate and osmolality both shortly before and during exercise tends to increase the incidence of stitches in individuals susceptible to ETAP (

Morton and Callister, 2000

,
 
2015

;
 
Morton et al., 2004

).








Several theories have been postulated to explain the causes of ETAP, but there is no consensus to date (

Waterman and Kapur, 2012

). Theories include (1) a lack of blood flow to the diaphragm during exercise leading to pain from ischemia, (2) subdiaphragmatic visceral ligament stress, (3) skeletal muscle cramps, and (4) irritation of the parietal peritoneum. Given that the muscles involved in respiration may deprive the rest of the body of blood flow under circumstances of deficit cardiac output and that ETAP is not associated with reduced inspiratory performance, it is unlikely that the diaphragm is directly responsible (

Morton and Callister, 2000

,
 
2006

). Electromyogram (EMG) activity is not elevated during ETAP; therefore, it is also highly unlikely that muscle cramps are responsible despite the subjective feeling of cramping (

Morton and Callister, 2008

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

). The visceral ligament stress theory is consistent with the influence of increased mass in the gut but does not explain the shoulder-referred pain. The primary function of the parietal peritoneum is to lubricate mobile viscera. Irritation could arise as a result of friction and that in turn could lead to pain. However promising this theory, it has yet to be fully substantiated (

Morton and Callister, 2000

,
 
2015

;
 
Plunkett and Hopkins, 1999

;
 
Waterman and Kapur, 2012

).








Several practical applications of the collective research have been suggested. To avoid a side stitch, an exerciser can try these recommendations:






1.
 Do not exercise immediately after eating a big meal or ingesting a large amount of fluid (≥1 L). Wait 2–3 hours.




2.
 When drinking during exercise, take small amounts (200–400 mL) frequently (at 15- to 30-minute intervals) rather than a single large drink at a rest stop or aid station.




3.
 When running downhill, try to keep your breathing regular and your footfalls light.






To deal with a stitch when it occurs:






1.
 Push in at the location of the pain with your hand, bend forward, and tighten the abdominal muscles.




2.
 Breathe more deeply to move more air into the lungs at the beginning of each breath, but do not try to force more air out at the end of each breath.




3.
 Breathe out through pursed lips. This contracts the abdominals. At the same time, if you are an entrainment breather, try to exhale on the opposite foot/side from normal.




4.
 If you experience side stitches frequently, try wearing a light, wide belt around your waist that can be tightened when necessary or better yet improve your core strength.

Older Adults


Normal, healthy aging causes progressive deterioration in both the structure and function of the respiratory system. The changes begin as young as 20 years and accelerate in the 50s and 60s.


Lung Volumes and Capacities


The effect of aging on TLC is controversial. Inconsistent evidence shows that TLC may
 decrease or stay the same in individuals over the age of 50 years (Berglund et al., 1963
; Jain and Gupta, 1974a
,b
; Johnson and Dempsey, 1991
; Kenney, 1982
; Stanescu et al., 1974
; Storstein and Voll, 1974
). However, research has firmly established that VC and inspiratory capacity (IC) decrease with age and that residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity (FRC) increase, thus changing the percentage of total volume that each occupies (Åstrand, 1952
, 1960
; Ericsson and Irnell, 1974
; Slonim and Hamilton, 1976
; Stanescu et al., 1974
; Turner et al., 1968
). For example, the ratio of RV/TLC doubles from about 15–30% in the elderly (Comroe, 1965
; Johnson and Dempsey, 1991
).



FEV
1
 and MVV decline steadily after approximately age 35 in both males and females (

Ashley et al., 1975

;
 
Ericsson and Irnell, 1974

;
 
Quanjer et al., 2012

;
 
Shepard, 1978

;
 
Slonim and Hamilton, 1976

;
 
Stanescu et al., 1974

). These declines result from a combination of structural

 and mechanical changes in the respiratory system. These changes include (1) decreased elastic recoil of lung tissue; (2) stiffening of the thoracic cage, which decreases chest mobility and creates a greater reliance on the diaphragm; (3) a decrease in intervertebral spaces, which in turn decreases height and changes the shape of the thoracic cavity; and (4) losses in respiratory muscle force and velocity of contraction. Of all these changes, the loss of elastic recoil appears to be the most important (

Johnson and Dempsey, 1991

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

;
 
Turner et al., 1968

).



Pulmonary Ventilation


REST Resting 

 (Figure 10.13
) and its components VT
 and frequency (Figure 10.14A
) are remarkably consistent across the entire age span. However, at rest, the percentage of VC used as VT
 does show a very slight U-shaped curve (Figure 10.14B
). Both young children and older adults use slightly more of their VC for VT
 at rest than young adults (Robinson, 1938
).


Submaximal Exercise 

 rises in older adults in response to increased energy needs. As in young adults, this increase is accomplished mainly by an increase in VT
 at lighter work rates and then by an increased frequency, if needed. Like children, older adults seem to have an exaggerated response in 

 compared with younger adults. That is, the absolute 

 is higher at any given work rate in older than in younger adults. Because the VC decreases with age and VT
 remains fairly stable, VT
 represents a higher percentage of the older adult’s VC (Åstrand, 1952
, 1960
; Davies, 1972
; DeVries and Adams, 1972
; Robinson, 1938
; Shepard, 1978
).


MAXIMAL EXERCISE With aging, both the ability to exercise maximally and the ability to process air decline. The decrement in pulmonary function contributes to the decline in work capacity but probably simply parallels the changes in circulation, metabolism, and muscle function that are occurring.



The highest
 

 values are typically seen in young adults, and these may decline by almost half by the seventh decade of life (

Figure 10.13

). This decline is evident both in absolute values (


 in liters per minute) and in values adjusted for body weight (


 in liters per kilogram per minute). Most of this decline is brought about by a reduction in V
T
, although maximal frequency does decrease slightly.




The percentage of VC used during maximal work is relatively stable with age from young adulthood on. However, the dead space to tidal volume ratio is consistently 15–20% higher in older adults than in younger adults (

Robinson, 1938

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

) because dead space increases both at rest and during exercise. Older adults begin to exhibit meaningful expiratory flow limitations at ventilatory rates that may be only half of where a younger individual would. This limitation worsens as the exercise intensity increases. At any given exercise ventilation, the work of breathing is higher in the older individual than the younger adult. This is often reflected in higher perceptions of dyspnea as one ages (

Romer et al., 2012

). The ventilatory breakpoints occur at lower absolute and relative workloads in older adults than in younger adults (

Shepard, 1978

).



External Respiration


REST The loss of elastic recoil in the lungs not only affects static and dynamic lung volumes but also influences the distribution of air in the lungs. Thus, ventilation may not be preferentially directed to the base of the lung in the upright posture at rest, although most blood flow is still directed there. As a result, there may be an imbalance between alveolar ventilation and pulmonary perfusion ( Johnson and Dempsey, 1991
).



In addition, structural changes in aging lung tissue decrease the alveolar-capillary surface area, which in turn means a decrease in diffusion capacity (

Donevan et al., 1959

;
 
Johnson and Dempsey, 1991

). Furthermore, pulmonary capillary blood volume decreases because of a stiffening of both pulmonary arteries and capillaries. The cumulative effects of these changes are a decrease in PaO
2
, but not P
A
O
2
, and a widening of the (A-a)PO
2
diff—although these changes are neither inevitable nor large. The saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen in arterial blood declines about 2–3% from age 10–70 (

Robinson, 1938

;
 
Shepard, 1978

).



EXERCISE During exercise, the increased ventilation that is required results in a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation in the lungs. Although the decreases noted at rest in diffusion surface and pulmonary capillary blood volume remain, the matching of ventilation and perfusion improves during exercise as more of the lung is used. The available reserve is sufficient to meet the demands for oxygen transport even to maximal exercise levels.



Nevertheless,
 

 is a smaller portion of minute ventilation in older adults than in younger adults. This change indicates a slightly decreased efficiency of respiration, but general arterial hypoxemia is prevented, and carbon dioxide elimination is adequate. That is, the PaO
2
 and PaCO
2
 are maintained within narrow limits and are similar to those for younger adults. The (A-a)PO
2
diff is more variable in older than in younger adults but, on average, is only slightly wider than the usual mean values for younger individuals (

 Johnson and Dempsey, 1991

;
 
Robinson, 1938

;
 
Shepard, 1978

). Highly fit older adults can, however, exhibit EIAH, as noted previously (

Prefaut et al., 2000

;
 
Romer et al., 2012

).



Internal Respiration


At rest and at any given submaximal level of exercise, the a-vO2
diff is greater in older adults than in younger adults. Thus, SvO2
% is lower. Conversely, at maximal exercise, the a-vO2
diff is lower in older individuals than in younger ones. Maximal values average 14–15 mL⋅dL−1
 in older adults but average 15–20 mL⋅dL−1
 in younger adults. Some of these changes in the a-vO2
diff can be attributed to a shift in the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, which makes the release of oxygen to the tissues more difficult (Kenney, 1982
; Shepard, 1978
). Refer to Figure 10.3
 to see this effect.




Respiratory Muscle Training Principles and Adaptations




Extensive training principles or guidelines are not included here for the respiratory system because respiratory training for healthy individuals is still rare and requires specialized equipment. Yet, the respiratory muscles are muscles and as such are subject to fatigue, especially the diaphragm, and as mentioned previously, this may cause vasoconstriction in the working musculature. During both short- and long-duration incremental or constant-load exercise ≤80% 

, the diaphragm does not fatigue. However, at more than 80–85% 

 intensity continued to exhaustion, the diaphragm does fatigue. The consequence of this fatigue is a decrease in exercise tolerance possibly due to the aforementioned metaboreflex (Sheel, 2002
). One study (Enright et al., 2006
) documented increased diaphragm thickness with increased performance and power output after high-intensity inspiratory muscle training. There is a growing interest in specific training for the respiratory muscles.



As with any type of muscular training, either strength or endurance may be emphasized in respiratory muscle training (RMT). There are two major types of respiratory muscle strength training (RMST): (1) inspiratory flow-resistive loading (IFRL) and (2) inspiratory pressure-threshold loading (IPTL). Respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET) consists primarily of voluntary isocapnic hyperpnea training (VIHT). Only occasionally has expiratory strength muscle training been undertaken alone. Most strength training involves only the inspiratory muscles, whereas endurance training typically stresses both inspiratory and expiratory muscles.














FIGURE 10.16
 Respiratory Muscle Training.
 A.
 This is an example of the specialized equipment used in respiratory muscle training. B.
 An individual is using the specialized equipment for respiratory muscle training.





Two techniques for IFRL training are used. The first technique utilizes equipment that requires the individual to inspire using a variable diameter opening (

Figure 10.16A and B

). At any given flow, the smaller the opening, the greater the resistance. The second technique first tests individuals by having them forcefully exhale to residual volume followed immediately by maximally inhaling against resistance to TLC. An image representing typically 80% of this pressure-time profile effort is presented on the computer screen. The training regime requires the participant to match (or exceed) this onscreen template within a progressively increasing work-rest ratio. For example, the maneuver is initially performed six times with a 60-second recovery. Only 45 seconds of recovery is permitted following the second set of six efforts. This pattern continues for six sets during which recovery is gradually reduced to 5 seconds.




IPTL involves inspiration against a resistance at a set percentage of peak inspiratory mouth pressure using a specific muscle trainer. This device requires continuous application of inspiratory pressure during inspiration for the valve to remain open while allowing for unrestricted expiration. Typically 30 inspiratory efforts are performed twice a day.




VIHT is performed with a device that uses partial rebreathing and ensures normal CO
2
 values. Tidal volume is controlled by feedback and breathing frequency is paced. Training sessions consist of low-force, high-velocity contractions and are typically conducted for 30 min·d
−1
, 3–5 d⋅wk
−1
 at 60–90% of MVV.




In general, regardless of the specific type of inspiratory muscle training employed (either RMST or RMET), functional measures of inspiratory muscle strength, endurance, maximal rate of shortening, maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity, and power have been increased. The importance of these changes is that they likely prevent or delay exercise-induced diaphragmatic fatigue. Delaying or diminishing respiratory muscle fatigue may attenuate the reflex vasoconstrictor activity in the limbs and help preserve limb blood flow. Whole body training does not provide resistance to inspiratory muscles fatigue. Structurally, significant increases in the proportion of type I (slow-twitch, oxidative) fibers and the size of type II (fast-twitch, oxidative glycolytic) fibers have been observed with RMT. Often, but not always, the perception of dyspnea is decreased. Respiratory values for minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation, breathing frequency, and tidal volume as well as oxygen consumption and lactate concentration are typically lowered and

 actual performance increased during constant submaximal performances or time trials even at intensities less than 80–85%
 

, whereas no improvement is seen at maximal exercise or in incremental tests to maximum. The magnitude of performance improvements when compared to control groups ranges from approximately 3–36%. Less fit individuals benefit more from RMT than highly trained athletes and improvements are greater in long-duration exercise. The inability of RMT to bring about significant changes during incremental tests and in
 

 is not really surprising as central circulatory adaptations require sustained and direct cardiovascular stimulation and this does not occur during RMT. In addition,
 

 tests only require high respiratory volumes for a brief period at the end of the test. Conversely, endurance time trial performances require high ventilatory volumes for a long duration placing a greater demand directly on respiratory muscles. These positive changes have been seen in rowers, cyclists, soccer players, swimmers, and runners as well as nonathletes such as the elderly (

Verges et al., 2007

;
 
Volianitis et al., 2001

;
 
Watsford and Murphy, 2008

).



Controlled-Frequency Breathing Training


In addition to RMT, swimmers occasionally use a technique called controlled-frequency breathing (CFB) as a training technique. As opposed to RMT, which makes the work of breathing harder, CFB restricts the number of breaths from the normal breathing pattern. The original assumption was that if a swimmer inhaled once every third, fifth, or eighth arm stroke, instead of every other arm stroke, then the reduced volume of air taken in would decrease oxygen partial pressure and create hypoxia, a decrease in available oxygen. According to this idea, hypoxia should bring about the same beneficial effects for swimmers as altitude training. Now, it is accepted that this does not occur. However, it is theorized that by restricting air exchange at the lungs, oxygen concentrations in pulmonary circulation and at the muscle tissue level allow the swimmer to train at moderate intensity but to mimic the limited oxygen levels characteristic of high-intensity exercise, thus stimulating adaptations to improve oxygen delivery. The long-term benefits of CFB on either sprint or endurance swim performance have yet to be evaluated.



Controlled-frequency breathing does reduce
 

 somewhat despite compensatory increases in V
T
 and oxygen extraction. At the same time, CFB as low as every fourth stroke increases the severity of inspiratory muscle fatigue that occurs during high-intensity front crawl swimming. Most importantly, it produces not hypoxia but hypercapnia, an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The hypercapnia in turn has been shown to alter the heart rate response to exercise by lowering it. This reduction in exercise HR means that if workouts are monitored by HR intensity, adjustment needs to be made in target values. In addition, hypercapnia often causes headaches that last for 30 minutes or more after the workout ceases. These headaches are painful and may interfere with training. On the positive side, CFB may increase buoyancy and improve body position, enabling the swimmer to concentrate on the biomechanics of the stroke. Despite this, CFB should be used sparingly and be closely monitored (

;
 
Lavoie and Montpetit, 1986

;
 
West et al., 2005

;
 
Zempel, 1989

).





Whole Body Respiratory Training Principles and Adaptations




Other than the specific responses to inspiratory muscle training indicated above, training adaptations that have been documented in the respiratory system occur as a by-product of whole body training for cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and/or metabolic improvement. Applications of the training principles are presented for these systems in their respective units. The few training adaptations that do occur in the respiratory system are documented in the following section.


Lung Volumes and Capacities


Studies of traditional land training sports (running, cycling, wrestling, and the like) have found no consistent significant changes in TLC, VC, RV, FRC, or IC in adult males or females of any age, nor have they found any differences favoring athletes over nonathletes (Bachman and Horvath, 1968
; Cordain et al., 1990
; Dempsey and Fregosi, 1985
; Eriksson, 1972
; Kaufmann et al., 1974
; Niinimaa and Shepard, 1978
; Saltin et al., 1968
). One exception appears to be yoga. Regular yoga training, which involves specific breathing exercises, has been shown consistently to improve respiratory muscle strength, MVV, FEV1
, VC, and peak expiratory flow rates (Abel et al., 2013
).



Evidence in children suggests that prepubertal exercise training may accelerate lung growth as an adaptive response. Moreover, prepubescent children may increase lung volumes and expiratory flow rates with long-term endurance training (

Romer et al., 2012

).




Studies of water-based activities (swimming and scuba diving) have shown that swimmers have higher volumes and capacities than both land-based athletes and nonathletes (

Cordain et al., 1990

;
 
Leith and Bradley, 1976

). In addition, swim training studies have demonstrated increases in TLC and VC in both children and young adults. Similar generalizations can be made for the dynamic measures of FEV
1
 and MVV (

Andrew et al., 1972

;
 
Bachman and Horvath, 1968

;
 
Clanton et al., 1987

;
 
Vaccaro and Clarke, 1978

;
 
Walsh and Banister, 1988

).




Precisely why swimmers but not land-based athletes show improvements in static and dynamic lung volumes is not known. However, swimmers doing all strokes except the backstroke breathe against the resistance of water, using a restricted breathing pattern with repeated expansion of the lungs to total lung capacity. Swimming also takes place with the body in a horizontal position, and this posture is optimal for perfusion of the lung and diffusion of respiratory gases (

Cordain and Stager, 1988

;
 
Mostyn et al., 1963

)

.




Evidence in children suggests that prepubertal exercise training may accelerate lung growth as an adaptive response. Moreover, prepubescent children may increase lung volumes and expiratory flow rates with long-term endurance training (

Romer et al., 2012

).



Pulmonary Ventilation


Changes in 

 are the primary and most consistent adaptations seen in the respiratory system as a result of endurance training. Although 

 itself does not change at rest, a shift occurs in its components: VT
 increases, and frequency decreases. This shift is maintained during submaximal
 work, but overall VT
 is lower during submaximal exercise as a result of the training. At maximal work, 

 is higher after training than before, accompanying the ability to do more work. The major component that changes is frequency, but VT
 increases as well (Dempsey et al., 1977
; Mahler et al., 1991
; Rasmussen et al., 1975
; Reid and Thomson, 1985
; Whipp, 1977
; Wilmore et al., 1970
). In addition, the capacity for sustaining high levels of voluntary ventilation is improved, reflecting increased strength and endurance of the respiratory muscles (Krahenbuhl et al., 1985
; Robinson and Kjeldgaard, 1992
).



These adaptations occur within the first 6–10 weeks of a training program (

Reid and Thomson, 1985

). They result from both land- and water-based activities across the entire age span (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Fringer and Stull, 1974

;
 
Nourry et al., 2004

;
 
Pollock et al., 1969

;
 
Seals et al., 1984

;
 
Zauner and Benson, 1981

;
 
Zauner et al., 1989

). The ventilatory thresholds shift to a higher workload and oxygen consumption as a result of training both in children and in adults indicating that a greater intensity of exercise can be maintained during endurance exercise performance across this age span (

Haffor et al., 1990

;
 
Laursen et al., 2005

FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Respiratory Training Changes in Older Adults






This study exemplifies several important concepts discussed in this text. Eighteen healthy sedentary males, aged 65–75 years, were divided into three equal groups. One group performed leg training (LT) on a leg ergometer (LE); the second group performed arm training (AT) on an arm ergometer (AE); the third group served as a control (C) and remained sedentary. Pre (before) and post (after) training, all participants performed two incremental exercise tests to maximum: one on the cycle ergometer and one on the arm ergometer. Twelve weeks of training occurred between tests. Training intensity was based on heart rate at the first ventilatory threshold (HRVT1
): 7 minutes at 90%; 10 minutes at 100%; 5 minutes at 110%; and 5 minutes at 90% for a total of 30 minutes 3 d·wk−1
. This is an example of how VT1 can be used to prescribe exercise. Approximately every 2 weeks, the training load (in watts) was adjusted to maintain the HRVT1
 percentages.







The results are presented in the accompanying graphs. Panel A presents the results in terms of power output (W). Four conclusions can be drawn:






1.
 The control group (data not shown) did not change either its maximal power output or the wattage at which the VT1 occurred. Thus, changes in the training groups can be interpreted as being the result of the training.




2.
 The AT and LT groups significantly improved post training in both modalities of testing and had significantly higher values than the controls. Thus, elderly individuals were trainable.




3.
 In all three groups, the power outputs were higher at both peak exercise and VT1 for the LE than the AE. This is a good example of large muscle versus small muscle mass differences.




4.
 The LT group improved more on the LE than the AE; the AT group improved more on the AE than LE. This exemplifies the principle of specificity. Both groups, however, improved in both modalities, indicating a degree of cross-training.






Panels B and C present the results for
 

 at peak exercise and VT1 during submaximal exercise. Parallel conclusions can be drawn for these variables:






1.
 Again, the control group (data not presented) did not show any changes.




2.
 Posttraining increases in both respiratory variables showed significant increases over pretraining values, except for the AT group on
 

 peak during LE testing. Maximal (or peak) minute ventilation increases are the most consistent pulmonary ventilation adaptation to training. Ventilatory thresholds were also expected to increase and did so consistently.




3.
 In all three groups, both
 

 and VT1 were significantly higher for LE than for AE, paralleling the differences in power output.




4.
 Specificity was again evident for both and VT1; the LT group improved more on the LE than the AE, and the AT group improved more on the AE than the LE.

External and Internal Respiration


In a healthy individual of any age and either sex, gas exchange varies little as a result of training (Reid and Thomson, 1985
; Romer et al., 2012
). Diffusion capacity has been reported to be higher in elite swimmers (Comroe, 1965
; Magel and Andersen, 1969
; Mostyn et al., 1963
; Vaccaro et al., 1977
) and runners (Kaufmann et al., 1974
), but it does not consistently increase at either submaximal or maximal work as a result of training (Saltin et al., 1968
). Even in studies where diffusing capacity did increase with training, it was most likely due to circulatory changes (an increase in pulmonary capillary volume) rather than any pulmonary membrane change per se. Higher values in diffusion capacity may be an example of genetic selection for specific athletes (Comroe, 1965
; Dempsey, 1986
; Dempsey et al., 1977
; Niinimaa and Shepard, 1978
; Vaccaro and Clarke, 1978
; Wagner, 1991
).



Arterial values of pH and PCO
2
 do not change with training, but venous pH levels increase (become less acidic) and PCO
2
 values decrease (

Rasmussen et al., 1975

) during the same submaximal exercise. The (A-a)PO
2
diff decreases at submaximal workloads as a result of training, indicating greater efficiency (

Saltin et al., 1968

). Training may also cause the oxygen dissociation curve to shift to the right, facilitating the release of oxygen from the blood into the muscle tissue (

Rasmussen et al., 1975

).




In children, neither the submaximal nor the maximal a-vO
2
diff adapts as a result of training (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Eriksson, 1973

). In young adults, the a-vO
2
diff increases at rest (

Clausen, 1977

;
 
Saltin et al., 1968

) and at maximal exercise as a result of training (

Blomqvist and Saltin, 1983

;
 
Coyle et al., 1984

;
 
Saltin et al., 1968

). Both increases and decreases in the a-vO
2
diff have been found during submaximal exercise as a result of endurance training (

Clausen, 1977

;
 
Ekelund, 1967

;
 
Ekelund and Holmgren, 1967

;
 
Saltin et al., 1968

). Changes in middle-aged and elderly adults are less likely than in younger adults (

Green and Crouse, 1993

;
 
Saltin, 1969

). Exercise training does not appear to protect against the normal age-related deterioration in lung function (

Romer et al., 2012

). None of the other partial pressure or saturation variables changes significantly and/or consistently with training.





Table 10.3

 summarizes the respiratory training adaptations discussed above.




TABLE 10.3
 Respiratory Training Adaptations






Why Are There So Few Respiratory Adaptations to Whole Body Exercise Training
?


The most commonly accepted answer to the question of why there are so few respiratory adaptations to whole body exercise training is that the pulmonary system is endowed with a tremendous reserve capacity that is more than sufficient to meet the demands of heavy physical exercise. Thus, the various structural and functional components of the respiratory system (lungs and airways) are not stressed to any significant limits during physical training and so do not need to change. At the same time, the cardiovascular and metabolic capacities of muscle are being stressed and do respond by adapting. The adaptations in these systems may ultimately exceed the capability of the respiratory system, as seen with EIAH and diaphragmatic fatigue, and the pulmonary system can become a limiting factor in elite athletes. So, the generalization that the respiratory system is “overbuilt” is accurate but only to a point. There is no need for great changes in the respiratory system in the normal healthy, moderately trained individual (Dempsey, 1986
; Dempsey et al., 1977
; McKenzie, 2012
; Sheel, 2002
), but highly trained elite athletes could use some adaptation.




Detraining and the Respiratory System




All available research evidence suggests that any physiological variable that is responsive to exercise training will also respond to detraining. There is no reason to suspect that this is not also true for the respiratory system, although research evidence is sparse for both specific respiratory muscle training and whole body respiratory training adaptations. The most common pattern is a rapid deterioration in maximal 

. In addition, detraining is associated with an increase in 

 during standardized submaximal exercise and at maximal exercise. These changes occur rapidly and progress to reductions approximating 10–14% if training is stopped for more than 4 weeks (Mujika and Padilla, 2000a
,b
).




Special Considerations




Altitude


The effects of altitude were mentioned briefly in Chapter 9
. This section details the effects of both acute and chronic exposure to altitude, the exercise response at altitude, and discusses the impact of altitude training on athletic performance. Refer back to Table 9.1
 and Equation 9.4 as background for the following discussion.


The Acute Impact of Altitude


The percentage of oxygen in air remains constant at 20.93% to an altitude of 100,000 m (328,083 ft) (Clausen, 1977
). However, the barometric pressure (PB
) decreases exponentially with increasing altitude. Thus, air has a lower density (fewer molecules per volume) at higher altitudes because the gas has expanded. For instance, at Denver (1,600 m, or 5,280 ft), PB
 is 630 mmHg, and at Colorado Springs (2,300 m, or 7,590 ft), PB
 is 586 mmHg (Figure 10.17
). Therefore, the oxygen partial pressure (PO2
)
 in atmospheric air is reduced at altitude. At Denver, the PO2
 is 132 mmHg (630 mmHg × 0.2093), and at Colorado Springs, it is 123 mmHg (586 mmHg × 0.2093), compared to 159 mmHg at sea level (760 mmHg × 0.2093). Because the partial pressure of the inspired oxygen decreases with altitude, the PA
O2
 also decreases to 80 and 74 mmHg, respectively, at Denver and Colorado Springs:









FIGURE 10.17
 The Impact of Altitude on External Respiration.









This decrease in P
A
O
2
 reduces the pressure gradient between the returning venous blood (PvO
2
) and the alveoli, resulting in a lower percent saturation (SaO
2
%) and arterial partial pressure (PaO
2
):









Figure 10.17

 summarizes these changes.



Acute Altitude Compensations


The decrease in PaO2
 stimulates an increase in 

 via the aortic and carotid body chemoreceptors as compensation to provide more oxygen for alveolar ventilation. The initial increase in 

 is hyperventilation (an increase in pulmonary ventilation that exceeds metabolic requirements) and is achieved primarily by an increase in respiratory frequency. Climbers on Mount Everest reportedly averaged 62 br·min−1
 and a 

 of 207 L·min−1
, obviously very high values (Armstrong, 2000
). Altitude-induced hyperventilation increases the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled. In turn, the increased exhalation of carbon dioxide decreases alveolar and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure and increases pH. The decrease in SaO2
% and the other resultant changes at the altitudes of Denver and Colorado Springs are minimal, perhaps 2–5% because of the flatness of the oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 10.3
) in that range. However, at the top of Pikes Peak (4,300 m, or 14,100 ft), SaO2
% is 82%, and the effect of altitude is very evident (Hannon, 1978
; Haymes and Wells, 1986
; Ratzin Jackson and Sharkey, 1988
). Table 9.1
 and Figure 10.17
 show the external respiration values. The SaO2
% is approximately 15% less at Pikes Peak than at sea level. Table 10.4
, first column, summarizes these changes.

Within the red blood cells, a chemical called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) increases at altitude. The effect of increased 2,3-DPG is the same as increased carbon dioxide partial pressure, hydrogen ion concentration, and body temperature on the oxygen dissociation curve (

Figure 10.3

). That is, it shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, offsetting the initial shift to the left (and decreased release of oxygen) that occurs because of the decreased PCO
2
 and increased pH brought about by hyperventilation. The result is a diminished ability of O
2
 to combine with Hb in the pulmonary circuit. However, at low and moderate altitudes, the increased dissociation at the tissue level is considered more important and beneficial.




Within 2 days of altitude exposure, hemoglobin concentration increases, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen transported per deciliter of blood. Unfortunately, the hemoglobin concentration increases only because total blood volume initially decreases due to mild dehydration. That is, the same number of red blood cells is distributed in a smaller volume of blood, a process called
 hemoconcentration
. The blood volume loss

 reflects a total body water loss through the kidneys and through increased respiratory evaporation because of the compensatory hyperventilation. Such hemoconcentration increases the viscosity of the blood, resulting in greater resistance to blood flow. In an attempt to maintain blood flow, heart rate increases (

Haymes and Wells, 1986

;
 
Ratzin Jackson and Sharkey, 1988

).
 
Table 10.4

, second column, summarizes these acute responses.




These altitude-induced acute responses are compounded during exercise. The normal exercise increase in diffusion capacity does not exceed that at sea level because PaO
2
 is decreased and PvO
2
 remains the same. As a result, the normal exercise increase in a-vO
2
diff is not as great at altitude as it is at sea level.




Cardiovascular changes occur as well. Heart rate and cardiac output increase in an attempt to compensate for the reduced oxygen content of the blood. Stroke volume is only marginally reduced initially but progressively declines for 1–2 weeks before stabilizing (

Mazzeo, 2008

).




Although the individual probably does not perceive any of the changes described above, except possibly hyperventilation, alterations can also occur in sensory acuity (vision and hearing), motor skills, memory, and mood (increased irritability). Dehydration and weight loss (in part due to the dehydrations and in part to an elevated resting metabolic rate) are common, as is sleep disturbance. In addition, some unpleasant sensations including a loss of appetite, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weakness may mark the onset of altitude sickness (

Hall, 2016

;
 
Haymes and Wells, 1986

).



Exercise Responses at Altitude


The acute effects of altitude are experienced most directly in terms of the intensity at which an aerobic endurance activity can be maintained. The higher the altitude and exercise intensity, the greater the impact and the sooner fatigue is felt. Although oxygen diffusion capacity is not a limiting factor, oxygen delivery cannot keep pace with muscle demand. Maximal aerobic power (

) declines (Mazzeo, 2008
; Wehrlin and Hallén, 2006
). Thus, any submaximal absolute load represents a higher relative load. The intensity at which any endurance event can be performed is lower, as is the ability to sustain that activity. The blood lactate response for a given power output is greater compared with sea level. These responses are true for all individuals at all ages, although high-altitude mountain climbers are impacted the most simply by virtue of the extreme altitudes at which they perform. Sprints and other muscular strength, muscular endurance, and power events do not appear to be physiologically disadvantaged, and they may even be enhanced because of lower air resistance at higher elevations (Burtscher et al., 2006
; Haymes and Wells, 1986
; Mazzeo, 2008
; Ratzin Jackson and Sharkey, 1988
).


Acclimation to Altitude


Acclimation to altitude begins quickly. It involves subtle but important shifts caused by the initial attempts to adjust to the lower oxygen partial pressure. Hemoconcentration continues, but the cause shifts from being a decrease in plasma volume with no change in red blood cell count to an increase in red blood cells under the influence of the hormone erythropoietin (Hall, 2016
). Blood volume remains depressed for several weeks but then begins to increase (Haymes and Wells, 1986
). Likewise, hyperventilation continues, but instead of an increased frequency, an increase in VT
 occurs. Increased VT
 allows a more effective pulmonary gas exchange. PaCO2
 remains depressed, but PaO2
 increases somewhat as acclimation proceeds (Adams et al., 1975
; Grover, 1978
; Hall, 2016
; Hannon, 1978
; Haymes and Wells, 1986
; Ratzin Jackson and Sharkey, 1988
). Cardiac output is lower despite the continued elevation in heart rate thus reflecting primarily a reduction in stroke volume with acclimation linked to the slow (>2 months) recovery of blood volume to sea-level values (Lundby, 2012
). Muscle blood flow and hence oxygen delivery to the muscles remain unchanged, but to an extent, these are compensated for by increased extraction of oxygen [(a-v)O2
diff]. 

 remains reduced. Upon altitude exposure, lactate values are higher for any given workload. After years of debate, it now appears that this response remains despite overall acclimatization (Lundby, 2012
). Females seem to acclimatize to altitude more readily than males (Grover, 1978
). Table 10.4
, third column, summarizes the respiratory chronic adaptations.


Training and Competing at Altitude and Sea Level


Athletes who wish to compete at altitude have two choices in attempting to minimize the adverse environmental effects. The first is to arrive at the altitude site 12–18 hours before the competition. Many US collegiate and some professional teams do this, even at the moderate altitudes where they compete. Although this strategy does not prevent the effects of altitude, it does minimize the chances that acute altitude sickness will impair performance (Haymes and Wells, 1986
; Ratzin Jackson and Sharkey, 1988
; Weston et al., 2001
).



The second choice is to train at the same altitude as the eventual competition. During training, athletes can acclimate somewhat to the altitude. However, even with extensive acclimation, a former sea-level resident will not be as physiologically adapted as the individual who was born and has always lived at altitude.




In 2007, the International Federation of Association Football (Fédération Internationale de Football Association or FIFA) passed a regulation regarding the matches in FIFA competitions at high altitude for both players and officials. The guidelines are as follows:




1.
 Above 2,500 m (~8,200 ft), an acclimation period of 3 days is strongly recommended.




2.
 Above 2,750 m (~9,000 ft), there is a mandatory acclimation period of 1 week.




3.
 Above 3,000 m (~9,800 ft), games are generally not permitted except with a minimum acclimation period of 2 weeks

.



Although most altitude training studies have been done on individual sport endurance athletes (runners, cyclists, swimmers), the regulations just stated point out the importance of altitude on performance in endurance-based team sports such as soccer and rugby. In particular, the concern in these sports is the capacity to perform consecutive accelerations or sprint endurance. Data exhibit a greater probability of a loss for a sea-level team playing against a moderate-/high-level altitude team and consistently show less distance covered during games played at altitude. Intermittent hypoxic training (IHT), that is, interval training under hypoxic conditions, sometimes known as repeated sprint training in hypoxia (RSH), may be particularly beneficial for these team sport athletes (Billaut and Aughey, 2013
; McLean et al., 2014
).



Unfortunately, the processes of acclimation do not completely counteract the fundamental hypoxic stress of altitude. Endurance athletes training at altitude cannot train at the same level of intensity for as long as they could at sea level. A reduction of training intensity to 40% of that at sea level may be necessary initially, and intensity can usually be increased only up to 75% of sea-level intensity (

Armstrong, 2000

). Highly trained athletes (especially those prone to exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia) are likely to benefit the least from altitude training (

Sinex and Chapman, 2015

). Untrained or minimally trained individuals, however, may still be doing more training than they did at sea level and reap the benefits of altitude training.




Athletes who train at altitude usually see positive results from that training if the competition is at the same altitude and occurs directly after the training period. The effect of altitude training on later sea-level maximal performance is highly dependent upon the type of altitude training undertaken, the fitness and performance status of the athletes (subelite or elite), the adaptation response of the individual athlete, the event, and the timing of the competition. Results show large variations in response and among individuals and techniques (

Mazzeo, 2008

;
 
Sinex and Chapman, 2015

). And techniques vary widely. For example, both natural/terrestrial and artificial altitudes may be utilized. Natural altitude training varies by elevation and where the athlete lives and/or exercises. Artificial altitudes can use either normobaric hypoxia (atmospheric pressure is unchanged but the fraction of inspired O
2
 is decreased) or hypobaric hypoxia (atmospheric pressure is decreased while the fraction of inspired O
2
 is maintained at sea-level value).




One group of athletes who must always perform at natural altitude is mountaineers. They typically follow a pattern of training and acclimation called “work (climb) high, sleep low,” although, of course, at some point, the sleep low is actually at a high altitude. Climbers traditionally establish a series of camp sites, each at a higher altitude than the previous one. During the day, they and their porters (

Figure 10.18

) carry supplies up to the higher camp (camp 2) and work at that altitude, and then they descend at night to camp 1 to sleep. This pattern continues for days or weeks, at which time the climbers reestablish themselves between the old high camp (camp 2) and a new higher location (camp 3, progressing then from 3 to 4, 4 to 5) until they are in position for the final ascent of the summit.










FIGURE 10.18
 Mountain Climbers Acclimate to Altitude by Establishing a Series of Camps in Which They Progressively Work High and Sleep Low until Attempting the Summit.





The most popular current strategy for nonmountaineer athletes who wish to improve competitive performance at sea level is really a variation of what mountaineers do called “live high, train low” (

Brugniaux et al., 2006a

,

b

;
 
Koistinen et al., 2000

;
 
Levine and Stray-Gundersen, 1997

;
 
Wehrlin et al., 2006

). The goal is to avoid the detrimental effects of altitude (having to train at greatly reduced exercise intensity, with the concomitant detraining effects), while at the same time reaping the benefits of altitude acclimation, which can improve oxygen-carrying capacity and dissociation. The Focus on Research box describes the definitive classic study that evaluated this approach. As is often the case with any training technique, individual reactions to “living high, training low” can vary widely, and some individuals will not respond at all.






FOCUS ON RESEARCH:
 Clinically Relevant





Live High, Train Low






This study was designed to test the hypothesis that acclimation to living at moderate altitude (2,500 m, 8,260 ft) combined with training at low altitude (1,250 m, 4,125 ft) (high-low condition) would improve sea-level (5,000 m, 3.1 mi) performance in already well-conditioned athletes more than both living and training either at high altitude (2,500–2,700 m, 8,260–8,900 ft), called high-high condition, or at sea level, called low-low control condition.







Thirty-nine athletes completed 2 weeks of sea-level familiarization and 4 weeks of sea-level training before being randomized into three groups of 13 athletes (nine males and four females in each group) for 4 weeks of high- or low-altitude or sea-level training and living. Training was periodized and tapered before all tests for all groups. As expected, those training at high altitude did so at a slower speed and at a lower percentage of maximal oxygen uptake than those at sea level. However, the training intensity of the low-altitude training group was reduced by only 6% compared with the sea-level group, whereas that of the high-altitude training group was reduced by 18.5%. Both groups that lived at moderate altitude significantly increased red blood cell mass by 9% and
 

 by 5%, while the sea-level group showed neither change. Arteriovenous oxygen difference was significantly higher for both altitude groups at velocities near 5,000-m run time trial speeds after altitude training. Velocity at
 

 increased only for the high-low group. The only group that significantly improved its 5,000-m time was the high-low group, by an average of 13.4 ± 10 seconds. This improvement persisted for at least 3 weeks after the return from altitude, at which point testing stopped.








These results suggest that an improvement in sea-level performance from altitude training is possible if athletes live at moderate altitude but train at lower levels that permit maintaining a high training intensity.

Although “living high and training low” might seem to simply require a mountain with a nearby accessible valley, in practice, such geographical features can be difficult to find and access. Another option now being used experimentally is artificial altitude in a nitrogen house; an airtight dwelling flushed with air diluted with nitrogen. This reduces the oxygen content from 20.93% to approximately 15% and simulates being at altitude. To train low, athletes simply leave the house (

Koistinen et al., 2000

). A much less costly option requiring further research is the use of a nitrogen tent. The tent can be set up on any bed or floor and used by an individual when resting and sleeping in his or her own home. Additional

 simulated situations include the use of hypobaric chambers or hypoxic inhalers.




A meta-analysis (

Bonetti and Hopkins, 2009

) investigated the effects on performance measured at or near sea level and related physiological measures of adaptation to six different variations of altitude training. These were (1) natural live high, train high (LHTH); (2) natural live high, train low (LHTL); (3) artificial (simulated) LHTL with long (8–18 hours) continuous exposure to “altitude”; (4) artificial LHTL with brief (1.5–5 hours) continuous exposure to “altitude”; (5) brief (<1.5 hours) intermittent periods of artificial hypoxia; and (6) artificial live low, train high (LLTH). Subelite athletes were found to achieve substantial enhancement of maximal endurance power output with #2 (natural live high, train low (4.2%)), #5 (artificial brief intermittent LHTL (2.6%)), and #3 (long continuous artificial LHTL (1.4%)). Elite athletes benefited only from #2 natural LHTL (4.0%). Thus, LHTL seems best for both nonelite and elite athletes.




If the “live high, train low” approach is taken, the following guidelines are important (

Brugniaux et al., 2006a

,

;
 
Lundby, 2012

;
 
Rusko et al., 2004

;
 
Sinex and Chapman, 2015

):




1.
 For those with sufficient time and resources, the LHTL model with natural altitude exposure is recommended. The altitude should be at least between 2,100 and 2,500 m (~6,700–8,200 ft) but less than 3,000 m (~9,800 ft) while training should take place at ≤1,250 m (~4,100 ft or less). If circumstances require it, simulated altitude can be used.




2.
 Hypoxic exposure should be greater than 12 hr·d
−1
, and preferably 16 hr·d
−1
.




3.
 Training should last at least 3–4 weeks.




4.
 High-intensity training must be maintained as if altitude were not involved.




The best time to return from altitude training prior to a major competition for peak performance remains to be determined. Conventional wisdom includes several phases relative to performance expectations: (1) return days 1–7, an initial improvement; (2) days 3–14, decrements in performance and reduced training capability; (3) days 14–20
+
, a high plateau in performance; and (4) days 36–46, possible benefits. Even given the overlapping days, the best timing may ultimately depend upon individual responses. Athletes who exhibit a high level of ventilatory acclimatization or mechanical limitations to ventilatory flow may need a period of sea-level training before competition; athletes with a faster than normal decline in RBC mass may need to compete as soon as possible upon return from altitude. Individual variation in the response to altitude training is not yet fully

 understood (

Exercise Training and Pollution


Air pollution consists of a mixture of many different chemicals. The major components of automotive pollution include sulfur dioxide (SO2
), nitrogen oxides (NOx
), ozone (O3
), particulates, and carbon monoxide (CO). Cigarette smoke, fires, and by-products of the combustion of other fuels also contribute to air pollution. Although the primary concern in this text are those who purposely exercise to achieve fitness or in preparation for athletic competition, it should be remembered that all individuals who must travel to work or whose primary place of employment is outdoors (city street workers, construction workers, bicycle messengers, active military personnel deployed in difficult environments) are also vulnerable to the physiological effects of pollution (Choudhary and Tarlo, 2014
; Korzeniewski et al., 2013
; Nyhan et al., 2014
).



The impairment of cilia function mentioned in
 
Chapter 9

 is not the only respiratory effect of inhaling these pollutants. Sulfur dioxide is absorbed by the moist surfaces of the upper airways and can cause bronchospasm. Sulfur dioxide peaks at midday but is rarely a major problem. Normal values approximate 0.005 ppm and sulfur dioxide does not negatively affect exercise until levels of 0.2 ppm (

Marr and Ely, 2010

). Nitrogen oxides are absorbed by the mucosal lining of the nose and pharynx and lead to irritation, cough, dyspnea, and diminished resistance to respiratory infection. Levels of NO
x
 are usually relatively low (~0.001 ppm), but values above 1 ppm would detrimentally affect exercise (

Marr and Ely, 2010

). Ozone is formed naturally by the action of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on oxygen as UVR enters the earth’s atmosphere and by the action of sunlight UVR on automobile exhaust (

Armstrong, 2000

). O
3
 levels are typically around 0.03 ppm and become a problem for exercise at 0.05 ppm (

Marr and Ely, 2010

). As a respiratory irritant, ozone impairs pulmonary function, causes lung inflammation, and may interfere with lung defense mechanisms (

Giles and Koehle, 2014

). Ozone causes a decrease in tidal volume, forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV
1
 and an increase in breathing frequency and airway resistance. Postexercise pulmonary symptoms of ozone exposure include chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath. In communities with high concentrations of ozone, the risk of children developing asthma is related to the time they spend outside and the number of outdoor sports they play. Acute ozone exposure reduces maximal exercise time, workload, oxygen consumption, and maximal performance (

Giles and Koehle, 2014

). Ozone levels are higher in summer than in winter because of the greater sunlight and elevated temperatures, and in rural rather than urban areas.




Particulates, also called particulate matter (PM), are solid or liquid materials produced from fuel combustion that remain suspended in air for long periods of time. Sources of PM include wood fires, fossil fuel combustion from lawn mowers, snowblowers, string trimmers, restaurant stoves, incense and candle burning, vehicular traffic, power plants, laser printers, and windblown dust. PM is categorized by size into coarse, fine, and ultrafine. Particulates greater than 10 μm in diameter are not considered harmful to airways since they are generally filtered by the nasal passageways. Coarse particulates are usually between 10 and 2.5 μm in diameter and are labeled as PM
10
. Fine particulates are between 0.1 and 2.5 μm in diameter (PM
2.5
) and ultrafine particles are less than 0.1 μm (PM
0.1
). All three of these sizes are smaller than the diameter of a human hair (

Giles and Koehle, 2014

). The smaller the particles, the deeper they can penetrate into the lungs. Experiments have shown that the deposit of ultrafine particles in the airways is high during mouth breathing in healthy individuals at rest and increases more than 4.5 times as much during moderate exercise (

Daigle et al., 2003

). As the intensity of exercise increases, the volume, rate, and depth of breathing also increase. An athlete running at 70%
 

 for approximately 3 hours during a marathon inhales the same volume of air as a sedentary person would in 2 days! When the ventilatory rate exceeds 30 L·min
−1
 (which it does easily even in low-intensity submaximal exercise), a combination of nasal and mouth breathing begins. This is important because a portion of the air then bypasses the

 nasal filtration, warming, and humidifying system (

Sacha and Quinn, 2011

). Additionally, as a result, a greater percentage of inhaled pollutants penetrate more deeply into the respiratory tract than at rest. Particulate pollution is highest in heavy smog, which can also include ozone. Lead is associated with particulates, and a significant relationship has been shown between training duration and blood lead accumulation. The effects of particulates include systemic oxidative stress, airway inflammation, vascular dysfunction, increased airway resistance, and decreased capacity for oxygen exchange. PM increase breathing frequency and decrease tidal volume (

Carlisle and Sharp, 2001

;
 
Giles and Koehle, 2014

;
 
Rundell, 2012

). There is an inverse dose-response relationship between air pollutants and lung function at constant exercise workloads (

Marr and Ely, 2010

). The prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), asthma, and low resting lung function is high for individuals who train and compete in high PM environments. Indoor winter athletes, especially ice hockey players and figure and speed skaters, can be particularly vulnerable. Ice resurfacing by internal combustion fossil-fueled machines (gas and/or propane) produces levels of CO, NO
x
, and PM 20–30 times greater than outside air. The use of electric-powered ice resurfacers maintains air quality. In addition to these health aspects, inhalation of high levels of PM during exercise has been shown to result in decreased performance in the range of 3–5%. In elite competitions, this could be enough to separate the winner and last-place finisher. Even a light 20-minute warm-up or one 6-minute bout of exercise in high-pollution conditions may have a detrimental carryover effect that could last for 3 days (

Haymes and Wells, 1986

;
 
McCafferty, 1981

;
 
Rundell, 2012

).




If the pollutant is CO, it reduces both the ability to carry oxygen and the ability to release oxygen already bound to red blood cells. The affinity of hemoglobin for CO is 210–240 times greater than its affinity for oxygen, and CO binds at the same site where oxygen would. Thus, when carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) is formed, the arterial percent saturation of oxygen decreases. The release of oxygen from hemoglobin is impaired by a shift in the oxygen dissociation curve to the left (see
 
Figure 10.3

). Myoglobin (Mb, the oxygen transporting and storage protein of muscles) and its role in assisting oxygen diffusion through the sarcoplasm to the mitochondria are also affected. First, the decreased release of oxygen from the red blood cells reduces the efficiency of Mb for attracting and holding oxygen within the muscle cells. Second, CO binds directly to Mb with approximately the same affinity as to Hb, thereby reducing myoglobin’s ability to combine with whatever oxygen is available. The combined result of the effects of elevated CO levels on Hb and Mb is an earlier and possibly greater dependence on anaerobic metabolism.




This is manifested by a lower exercise intensity at which anaerobic metabolism becomes important, a shorter endurance time at submaximal loads, a lower maximal exercise performance, a lower maximal a-vO
2
diff, and a lower maximal oxygen consumption (


) (

McDonough and Moffatt, 1999

). As little as a 4% COHb level will have detrimental effects on exercise time and intensity. This level may result if training is done near heavy traffic (

Figure 10.19

). CO inhaled by smoking has additional respiratory impact, including increased pulmonary airway resistance, increased oxygen cost of ventilation, and an increased diffusion distance for oxygen and carbon dioxide across the alveolar walls because of mucosal swelling and bronchial constriction (

McDonough and Moffatt, 1999

). The higher the %COHb, the higher the
 

 for the same work rate (

Giles and Koehle, 2014

). COHb levels of 5% can increase heart rate during exercise. Individuals smoking 10 or fewer cigarettes per day average approximately 4% COHb, and a two-pack-a-day habit almost doubles this value. A nonsmoker riding in a car for 1 hour with a smoker can reach 3% COHb level (

Haymes and Wells, 1986

). Strenuous exercise near heavy traffic for 30 minutes can increase the level of COHb as much as smoking 10 cigarettes (

Carlisle and Sharp, 2001

;
 
Giles and Koehle, 2014

). The half-life of COHb is 3–4 hours, meaning that it takes that long for one half of the CO to become unbound to hemoglobin and be removed.










FIGURE 10.19
 Training Near Traffic will Increase COHb Levels.





Swimmers have unique pollutants to deal with. The reaction of chlorine-containing agents with organic nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., dirt, sweat, and urine) brought into the pool water by users leads to the formation of various chloramine by-products. Some of these are transferred to the atmosphere as gases or droplets just above the water as the surface of the water is churned up. These are inhaled by swimmers. One of them, nitrogen trichloride (NCL
3
), is known to cause acute disruption of airway epithelium. NCL

 will reduce the concentration of chloramines that accumulate in the air above pool water. Breathing air containing chloramines during the many hours of training in indoor pools appears to be the reason for the high prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma, and exercise-induced

 bronchoconstriction in swimmers (

Kippelen et al., 2012

;
 
Nicholas, 2015

).




Athletes are often affected by pollution levels that do not bother spectators. Individuals with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and children are also particularly vulnerable (

McCafferty, 1981

). The following recommendations are suggested to minimize the impact of pollutants on an exercise training session or competition (

Armstrong, 2000

;
 
Campbell et al., 2005

;
 
Cutrufello et al., 2012

;
 
Giles and Koehle, 2014

;
 
Kippelen et al., 2012

;
 
McCafferty, 1981

):




1.
 Individuals with health problems that make them particularly susceptible to the effects of pollution should not exercise outside during air quality warnings. They should seek sites where the air is filtered.




2.
 Everyone should avoid prolonged heavy exercise when hazardous air warnings are in effect. Individuals can adapt to breathing pollutants, but in the long term, adaptation is harmful because it suppresses normal defense mechanisms. Therefore, adaptation should not be attempted. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, pain with breathing deeply, or difficulty breathing should reduce their activity level and seek medical attention.




3.
 Atmospheric ozone levels peak at around 1–3
 pm
 and are much higher during most of the daylight hours in summer than in winter. CO peaks at approximately 7
 am
 and 8
 pm
 and is higher in winter than in summer. Thus, heavy outdoor workouts might be best early in the morning and late evening during the summer and around noontime in the winter.




4.
 Runners, cyclists, and in-line skaters should seek locations away from heavy vehicular traffic. Exercise should not be performed within 250 m of major roadways and should be avoided during times of high vehicular congestion. Trailing closer to a pace car than 50 ft or waiting at stoplights behind cars’ exhaust pipes should be avoided. At the very least, athletic venues, parks, and exercise areas near high-traffic roads should have evergreen trees planted between the road and the facility.




5.
 Smoking should be banned from all indoor training and competition sites. Smoking should be discouraged at all times. Individuals need to be mindful that environments in night clubs and/or casinos are likely to be cigarette smoke–filled locations.




6.
 Arenas that use fossil-fueled ice-resurfacing machines and have poor ventilation should be avoided. Skiers should be deterred from spending long hours in the hot waxing room and should make sure the area is always well ventilated. Cold weather exercisers can employ strategies that increase temperature and water content of the inhaled air that may include face masks at subfreezing temperatures. However, these devices make it difficult to train and/or compete at high intensity.




7.
 To avoid the production of as many chloramines as possible, swimmers should shower with soap before entering the pool, wear a bathing cap, use a swimsuit reserved exclusively for swimming, remove makeup, and respect bare-feet zones.To evaluate your understanding of respiratory factors that may impact maximal exercise performance complete the Check Your Comprehension 2 box.

SUMMARY





1.
 During short-term, light to moderate aerobic exercise, minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation, and the arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO
2
diff ) increase rapidly and reach a steady state within approximately 2–3 minutes. The partial pressure of oxygen at the alveolar and arterial levels does not change, and, as a result, the alveolar to arterial oxygen pressure gradient and percent saturation of arterial hemoglobin with oxygen are maintained. The ratio of dead space to tidal volume, percent saturation of oxygen in venous blood, and the partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood decrease rapidly and reach a steady state within approximately 2–3 minutes. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases in the venous blood as the result of the increased energy production, but the partial pressure of carbon dioxide decreases slightly due to the hyperpnea.




2.
 During the first 30 minutes of long-term, moderate to heavy aerobic exercise, the only meaningful differences in respiratory responses from short-term, light exercise are in magnitude and a slight drop in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen; this in turn widens the alveolar to arterial oxygen pressure gradient. After approximately 30 minutes, minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation, and the a-vO
2
diff exhibit an upward drift. This respiratory drift is associated with a rising body temperature.




3.
 During incremental aerobic exercise to maximum, both minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation

 exhibit a rectilinear rise interrupted by two breakpoints that change the slope upward. The a-vO
2
diff rises rectilinearly until approximately 60% of maximal work, where it levels off. The partial pressures of both alveolar and arterial oxygen and the resultant alveolar to arterial oxygen pressure gradient and percent saturation of arterial blood remain constant until approximately 75% of maximal work. At this point, the first three exhibit a slight exponential rise, and the arterial oxygen saturation percent decreases slightly as a result. Both the percent saturation of oxygen in venous blood and the venous oxygen partial pressure decrease rectilinearly until approximately 60% of maximal work, where they level off. As the oxygen is extracted and used, carbon dioxide is produced so that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in venous blood rises sharply at first and then more slowly. The arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide is maintained initially but then declines as additional carbon dioxide is blown off by the increasing hyperpnea.




4.
 In most healthy sedentary or moderately trained individuals, the respiratory system has more than enough reserve for the ventilatory and gas-exchange demands for exercise of any intensity. However, there are three situations in which the respiratory system may limit high-intensity exercise: a) exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH), b) respiratory muscle fatigue, and c) excessive fluctuation in intrathoracic pressure. A primary cause of EIAH is a widening of (A-a)PO
2
 diff, the failure to maintain arterial oxygen saturation.




5.
 All of the respiratory responses to static exercise are the same as for short-term, light to moderate submaximal aerobic exercise except that oxygen extraction, as denoted by the a-vO
2
diff, either shows no change or decreases slightly and minute ventilation and a-vO
2
diff exhibit little, if any, change during exercise, with a rebound rise in recovery.




6.
 During exercise, oxygen dissociation is increased by a widening of the oxygen pressure gradient, an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide, a decrease in pH, and an increase in body temperature. The changes in PCO
2
, pH, and body temperature increase oxygen release by causing a shift to the right of the oxygen dissociation curve. At altitude, the tendency for the decrease in PCO
2
, caused by the compensatory hyperventilation, to shift the curve to the left and impair oxygen dissociation is counteracted by an increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate activity.




7.
 Locomotor-respiratory coupling (entrainment) occurs when limb movement is synchronized with breathing frequency. Exercising individuals should use either an entrainment or a spontaneous breathing pattern, whichever comes more naturally to them.




8.
 In general, exercise responses are in the same direction but may vary in magnitude across the age span for both males and females.




9.
 Many of the differences in respiratory measures when comparing children and adolescents with young adults or males with females are at least partially related to size. Smaller individuals have smaller values.




10.
 Specific respiratory muscle training results in increases in functional measures of inspiratory muscle strength, endurance, maximal rate of shortening, maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity, and power. Structurally, significant increases in the proportion of type I (slow-twitch, oxidative) fibers and the size of type II (fast-twitch, oxidative glycolytic) fibers have been observed. Often, but not always, the perception of dyspnea is decreased. Respiratory values for minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation, breathing frequency, and tidal volume as well as oxygen consumption and lactate concentration are typically lowered and actual performance increased during constant submaximal performances or time trials, whereas no improvement is seen at maximal exercise.




11.
 Whole body training respiratory adaptations are minimal in land-based athletes or fitness participants. The most consistent change is in minute ventilation, which goes down during submaximal work and increases at maximum. Yoga, swimming, and diving show increases in most static and dynamic lung volumes and capacities, particularly in total lung capacity and vital capacity.




12.
 The relative percentages of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen remain the same to an altitude of 100,000 m (328,083 ft). However, because barometric pressure goes down exponentially as altitude increases, the partial pressures exerted by oxygen and carbon dioxide also decrease with altitude. The result is a lower percent saturation of oxygen and a decreased ability to maintain high-intensity aerobic exercise.




13.
 Individuals who must compete at altitude should arrive at the location either 12–18 hours or 3 days to 4 weeks before the event. Acclimation and training at altitude appear to be beneficial for competing at that same altitude. Evidence supports the use of a “live high, train low” regimen for improvement in sea-level performance for endurance athletes. Not everyone will be a positive responder to altitude training.




14.
 Exercise in highly polluted air should be avoided. Any adaptation to such conditions is done at the expense of natural defense mechanisms.
