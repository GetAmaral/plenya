Introduction





The skeletal system includes the bones and connective tissue (cartilage, tendons, and ligaments) that provide the framework for the muscles and organs of the body. Like other systems of the body, the skeletal system adapts to exercise training. A healthy skeletal system is important for preventing sports-related injuries and major health problems, including osteoporosis.



Connective tissue plays a vital role in holding the skeleton together, creating articular surfaces, connecting muscle and bone to permit movement, and ensheathing organs. Like all systems of the body, connective tissues respond to stresses placed upon them. However, relatively little research exists to systematically describe the effects of exercise on connective tissues despite the fact that it provides an important component of the structure of the body, is essential to health and performance, and is often injured during fitness activities and athletic endeavors (e.g., torn cartilage or sprains that pull tendons). In fact, it is relatively recently that research has focused on how skeletal tissue, itself a type of connective tissue, responds to exercise. Exercise physiologists have focused on issues such as the maximization of peak bone mass, the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and the impact of heavy exercise training on the skeleton of growing prepubescent athletes. This chapter addresses these important issues after reviewing basic concepts of skeletal physiology and the influence of physical activity on bone tissue.





Skeletal Tissue




Bone tissue, also called osseous tissue, is a dynamic, living tissue that is constantly undergoing change. In fact, adults recycle 5–7% of their bone mass every week (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
). Bone remodeling
 (bone turnover) refers to the continual process of bone breakdown (resorption) and formation (deposition of new bone). Bone remodeling has important roles in regulating blood calcium levels and replacing old bone with new bone to ensure the integrity of the skeletal system. The mass and shape of bones depend largely on the stress placed on them. The more bones are stressed (by mechanical loading during physical activity), the more they increase in volume and mass, specifically at the site of mechanical loading. The concept that bone adapts to changes in mechanical loading is described by Wolff’s law
 (Beck and Marcus, 1999
); that is, bone forms in areas of stress and is resorbed at areas of nonstress.

Functions


The skeletal system provides a number of important structural and physiological functions. Structurally, the skeletal system provides rigid support and protection for vital organs and allows for locomotion. Physiologically, skeletal tissue provides a site for blood cell formation (hematopoiesis in bone marrow), plays a role in the immune function (providing the site for white blood cell formation), and serves as a dynamic storehouse for calcium and phosphate, which are essential for nerve conduction, heart and muscle contraction, blood clotting, and energy formation (Bailey and McColloch, 1990
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
).



The ability of bone to perform its structural functions relates directly to its role in storing calcium. Because calcium is essential for many processes in the body, bone is broken down (resorbed) as needed to maintain blood calcium levels. The body sacrifices bone mineral (calcium) when it is needed to maintain blood calcium levels.



Regulation of Blood Calcium


As shown in Figure 16.1
, the skeletal system (bone), the digestive system (stomach and intestines), and the urinary system (kidneys) operate together to regulate and maintain blood calcium levels. Adequate ingestion and absorption of calcium are required through the digestive system to provide the necessary calcium to be deposited in bone. In turn, because of the importance of calcium in so many vital processes of the body, bone mass is broken down to maintain blood calcium within normal limits (9–11 mg·dL−1
). The kidneys regulate blood calcium by filtering and reabsorbing it. The primary hormones involved in regulating blood calcium levels and bone remodeling are parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, and vitamin D (calcitriol).

Calcium is essential for the structure of bone (and teeth) and for numerous physiological functions (muscle contraction, nerve conduction, blood clotting). Blood calcium levels are maintained by the coordination of several systems, notably the digestive, urinary, skeletal, and hormonal systems. Bone loading affects bone formation and resorption.

Levels of Organization


Understanding the structure and physiology of the skeletal system helps one understand how the skeletal system responds to exercise and training.


Bones as Organs


The human body contains over 200 different bones joined together at articulations known as joints. Joints enable movement when muscles exert force on the bones. The skeleton is typically divided into two categories: the axial (or central) skeleton that includes the bones of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and the appendicular (or peripheral) skeleton that includes the bones of the hips, shoulders, and extremities. Bones have several different shapes—long, short, flat, and irregular—and each shape is specific to its function. Furthermore, according to Wolff’s law, a bone’s shape reflects its response to the stress placed on it.


Bone Tissue


The two types of bone tissue are cortical and trabecular bone. Cortical bone, also called compact, dense, or lamellar bone, is densely packed. It makes up around
 80% of the skeleton. Trabecular bone, also called spongy or cancellous bone, is more porous and is surrounded by cortical bone. Individual bones are composed of both types of bone tissue in varying relative proportions. Table 16.1
 presents relative percentages of trabecular and cortical bone tissue in various bones of the body. In general, bones of the axial skeleton have a much greater percentage of trabecular bone, whereas bones of the appendicular skeleton have a greater percentage of cortical bone. Figure 16.2
 shows the humerus, a typical long bone. The shaft is composed primarily of cortical bone, and the epiphyses have a greater percentage of trabecular bone.

 Structure and cross-sectional view of bone.





Cortical bone is composed of osteons, which are the functional units of bone (Haversian system). Osteons are organized into concentric layers of matrix called lamellae, which are surrounded by widely dispersed cells. The matrix, the intercellular space, is made up of organic and inorganic substances.




Trabecular bone is composed of branching projections or struts, called trabeculae, which form a lattice-like network of interconnecting struts. Its appearance gives rise to another of its names, spongy bone. Trabecular bone has the same cells and matrix elements as does cortical bone, but with more porosity. About 80–90% of the volume of cortical bone is calcified, while only 15–25% of trabecular bone is calcified (

Baron, 1993

). The remaining volume is occupied by bone marrow, blood vessels, and connective tissue. Cortical bone is best suited for structural support and protection, and trabecular bone is best suited for shock absorption and physiological functions.




Because of its large surface area, trabecular bone can remodel more rapidly than can cortical bone. The greatest age-related loss of bone mineral density (BMD) also occurs in trabecular bone. Therefore, most osteoporotic fractures occur in areas composed predominantly of trabecular bone (wrist, hip, and spine)

.



Bone Development


Bone development involves three processes: bone growth, bone modeling, and bone remodeling. Each process predominates at different times throughout an individual’s life.


Growth


Bone growth refers to size increase caused by an increasing number of bone cells (Frost, 1991a
). There are two types of bone growth. Appositional growth is an increase in thickness or mass. Longitudinal growth occurs at the epiphyseal plate until a person reaches adult stature. This is an area of interest because of concerns that excessive exercise might stunt a child’s growth.



The longitudinal growth of bones results from the growth of cartilage, which is later replaced by bone. While growing, bone is also remodeling itself—that is, changing its shape and thickness. Bone growth and remodeling are distinct but closely related processes. In general, growth refers to the longitudinal growth of bone, and remodeling involves the balance between bone resorption and bone formation. If bone formation exceeds resorption, this process would also represent growth.



Modeling



Bone modeling
 is the process of altering the shape of bone and adjusting bone strength through bone resorption and bone formation (Frost, 1991a
; Khan et al., 2001c
). Micromodeling involves the microscopic level of cell organization that occurs during formation; it determines what kind of tissue will be formed (Frost, 1991a
). Macromodeling controls if, when, and where new tissue will form or old tissue will be removed. This process ensures that the bone’s shape matches its role (Frost, 1988
, 1991a
,b
; Khan et al., 2001c
; Lanyon, 1989
; Marcus, 1987
). Modeling is largely responsible for bone growth during the years in which the skeleton is growing.


Remodeling


Bone remodeling involves a continual process of bone turnover, maintenance, replacement, and repair (Frost, 1991a
). It reflects the balance between the coupled processes of bone resorption and bone formation. This ongoing process occurs because of the coupled actions of bone cells, with osteoclasts responsible for bone resorption and osteoblasts responsible for bone formation. Remodeling occurs in response to stress on the skeleton throughout the adult years. Physical activity influences bone strength and mass through remodeling, which is accomplished largely because of the activity of bone cells.

BONE CELLS The three types of bone cells are osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. These cells are the living part of bone. Although the cells represent a small fraction—less than 2% (Teitelbaum, 1993
)—of the total composition of bone, they are responsible for its remodeling
.



Osteoclasts
 are large, multinucleated bone cells that cause the resorption of bone tissue. Osteoclasts secrete enzymes that disintegrate bone matrix. As the bone is degraded, the mineral salts (primarily calcium and phosphate) dissolve and move into the bloodstream.
 Osteoblasts
 are bone cells that cause the deposition of bone tissue. Also called bone-forming cells, osteoblasts produce an organic bone matrix that becomes calcified and hardens as minerals are deposited in it. Hardening of the bone matrix is known as ossification.
 Osteocytes,
 which are mature osteoblasts surrounded by calcified bone, help regulate the process of bone remodeling. Osteocytes appear to initiate the process of calcification.




The actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are coupled; they function as a coordinated bone multicellular unit (BMU) to remodel bone (

Goldring 2015

). Osteoclasts must first cause bone resorption before the osteoblasts can form new bone.
 
Figure 16.3

 outlines the major events of a bone-remodeling cycle (

Marcus, 1987

;
 
Parfitt, 1987

;
 
Teitelbaum, 1993

). From the resting phase (

Figure 16.3A

), the osteoclasts are stimulated and cause the resorption of bone, forming a cavity (

Figure 16.3B

 and
 
C

). Osteoblasts then appear and deposit bone matrix where the cavity exists (

Figure 16.3D

). The matrix is called osteoid until it is calcified (

Figure 16.3E

). Calcification of the new bone occurs as calcium and phosphate minerals are deposited in the osteoid (

Figure 16.3F

). The bone then returns to the resting or quiescent phase.

Bone remodeling may result in greater bone mass, the same bone mass, or a reduction in bone mass. Through young adulthood, typically, more bone is formed than is resorbed, increasing bone mass. This increased mass strengthens the bone and accounts for the increase in bone mineral density (BMD) that commonly occurs during this period of life. When bone remodeling is in equilibrium, the amount of bone resorbed equals the amount of bone formed; thus, bone mineral density remains relatively constant. In older adults and those with certain diseases, the amount of bone resorbed is greater than the amount of bone formed, decreasing bone mineral density.




The remodeling of bone provides for skeletal growth and involves a constant turnover of bone throughout life. Bone remodeling is a complex process regulated by hormonal and local factors (

Canalis, 1990

).



HORMONAL CONTROL Bone remodeling reflects the interrelationship between the structural and physiological functions of bone. Calcium is not only necessary to provide structural integrity of bone but also essential for
 the proper functioning of the heart, skeletal muscles, and nervous tissue. Only about 1 g of calcium is present in the extracellular fluid of the body, compared to approximately 1,150 g of calcium present in bone tissue (Bailey and McColloch, 1990
; Khan et al., 2001c
).



Excess calcium in the blood leads to the release of calcitonin (from the thyroid gland), which causes deposition of calcium in the bone. This deposition decreases the blood calcium level and increases bone mineral density. Conversely, when the blood calcium level drops below normal, parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoclast activity, causing calcium to be released from its storage site, bone. This release of calcium from the bone causes the blood calcium level to increase and bone mineral density to decrease.
 
Table 16.2

 summarizes the effect of calcitonin and PTH on bone and blood calcium levels. Vitamin D (calcitriol) is important for the absorption of calcium from the intestines. Thus, it leads to an increased blood level of calcium.




TABLE 16.2
 Effect of Calcitonin and PTH on Bone and Blood Calcium Levels







Other hormones that play an important role in skeletal health are the sex steroids (estrogen and testosterone) and growth hormone. These hormones stimulate the protein formation necessary for bone growth and are responsible for the eventual closure of the epiphyseal plate, which determines bone length and thus a person’s height (

Bailey and McColloch, 1990

). Estrogen promotes calcium retention and acts as an inhibiting agent of parathyroid hormone. The loss of the protective role of estrogen on the skeletal system after menopause or during secondary amenorrhea has important consequences for females. Decreased estrogen causes increased bone resorption. Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) also play an important role in bone formation and remodeling in children. Hormones are themselves stimulated by other factors, including physical activity and nutritional status.





Measurement of Bone Health




Bone strength is determined by bone mass, external geometry, and internal microstructure (Beck and Marcus, 1999
; Frost, 1997
; Heaney et al., 2000
). Because it is difficult to quantify external geometry and microstructure, measures of bone mass and bone mineral density are most often used to describe bone strength. Bone strength refers to bone’s ability to withstand forces that may cause fracture. Bone strength is largely influenced by bone mass. A less dense bone will break with less force (Heaney et al., 2000
). Bone mineral content (BMC)
 refers to the absolute amount of calcium and phosphate salts and is measured in grams. The calcium and phosphate salts are responsible for the hardness of the bone matrix. Bone mineral density (BMD)
 is defined as the relative value of bone mineral per measured bone area, expressed as grams per centimeter squared (g·cm−2
) or milligrams per centimeter cubed (mg·cm−3
), depending on the technology used to measure area.



Accurate measures of bone mineral content and bone mineral density can be obtained only in laboratory or clinical settings, primarily because of the cost of equipment and safety considerations. Nonetheless, these measurements have dramatically increased the information available to researchers, clinicians, and those in fitness professions.



Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry


Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method of measuring BMD for research and clinical purposes American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM
, 2004). DXA uses an x-ray beam to measure regional and whole-body mineral content (Figure 16.4
) and provides an areal bone mineral density (aBMD) value. Areal BMD provides a two-dimensional measure of density. Figure 16.5
 shows a computer-generated printout of whole-body BMD and various regions of the body for a 37-year-old active female. Figure 16.5A
 represents regions of the body individually analyzed for BMD. The total body BMD is compared with standard references in Figure 16.5B
. The blue area represents an average range across the age span of 20–100 years. Notice that the individual in the example is above average for total body BMD as represented by the asterisk (located at the intersection of age 37 years and BMD of 1.197 g·cm−2
).

Regional BMDs are shown in
 
Figure 16.5C

 along with comparisons with young adult normative data. Notice that each region of the body has a unique BMD value because of the varying composition of bones. For example, the legs have a BMD of 1.229 g·cm
−2
, whereas the pelvis has a BMD of 1.217 g·cm
−2
. These values correspond to 106% and 110% of young adult values, respectively. In addition to these total body scans, clinicians and researchers often measure BMD at specific, clinically relevant sites, such as the hip or spine, where osteoporotic fractures are more likely. When scanning just a small area (e.g., a hip or spine), a better-quality scan results.
 
Figure 16.6A and B

 present a hip and spine scan of an active, older woman. These site-specific scans enable researchers to investigate differences in bone mineral density at various sites, among various individuals, and as a result of adaptation to long-term exercise training.

Bone mineral density derived from DXA is the basis of the operational definitions of osteopenia and osteoporosis. BMD is normally distributed and is often expressed in standard deviation (SD) units related to its T or Z distribution. The T distribution has a mean score of zero (0).

 Osteopenia
 is a condition of decreased bone mineral density defined as a T-score of −1 to −2.5. This means a BMD value greater than one standard deviation below (but not more than 2.5 SD below) values for young, normal adults (25–35 years, sex-matched).
 Osteoporosis
 is a condition of porosity and decreased BMD defined as a T-score greater than −2.5, indicating a BMD more than 2.5 SD below values for young, normal adults (

WHO, 1994

).
 Established osteoporosis
 is the term for the condition of osteoporosis, as defined above, plus one or more fractures (

Kanis et al., 1993

).
 
Figure 16.7

 indicates the relative risk of fracture at the spine, hip, and forearm based on T-scores.










FIGURE 16.7

 Data from Khan et al. (2001b).





The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) recommends using T-scores for evaluating postmenopausal women and Z-scores for adolescents and premenopausal women. Both T- and Z-scores represent SDs from the average score, but the comparison group for Z-scores is age- and sex-matched while the T-score compares with a single sex-matched young adult value. The ISCD defines a Z-score above −2 (<2 SDs below average) as a BMD “within the expected range for age.” Z-scores of −2 or lower (more than 2 SDs below average) are defined as “below the expected range for age.” Z-score comparisons with age-matched peers are especially important for individuals under the age of 20 years because they are still accumulating bone (

Leib et al., 2004

).




In addition to measures of bone mineral density, DXA measures have been used to estimate bone strength. As discussed earlier,
 bone strength
 refers to the ability of bone to resist fracture and is determined by bone mass, physical properties of bone, and bone geometry. Variables thought to reflect bone strength include directly measured variables, such as the cross-sectional area, and calculated variables, such as a bending index and a strength index.






Osteopenia
 A condition of decreased bone mineral density (BMD) defined as a T-score of −1 to −2.5, which means a BMD value greater than one standard deviation (SD) below (but not more than 2.5 SD below) values for normal young adults.



Osteoporosis
 A condition of porosity and decreased bone mineral density defined as a T-score below −2.5, which indicates a BMD greater than 2.5 SD below values for young, normal adults.




Quantitative Computed Tomography


Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is a newer technique that provides researchers with measures of bone health in addition to BMD (Figure 16.8
). QCT can determine the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of trabecular and cortical bone. Volumetric BMD is a measure of three-dimensional volume. Peripheral QCT (pQCT) also provides a measure of bone strength during compression (BSI) and of torsional strength (SSIp). Since QCT appears more sensitive to bone changes than DXA, QCT measures will likely be used increasingly to assess bone adaptations to exercise (Khan et al., 2001c
; Polidoulis et al., 2012
).

Field Tests


At present, no field tests validly predict bone mineral density specifically. However, a recent literature review and a study by Janz et al. (2015)
 are encouraging and suggest that a jump field test may reflect bone health. The 2012 report “Fitness Measures and Health Outcomes in Youth” (Institute of Medicine, 2012
) reviewed the literature relative to musculoskeletal fitness and bone health and concluded that there is a positive association between measures of muscle strength and power and bone health in adults, but that there is a dearth of high quality of studies establishing this link in youth. Nonetheless they recommended the inclusion of a muscle power test, the standing long jump, for health-related physical fitness
 testing of youth. The Janz et al. (2015)
 study provides direct evidence that muscle power predicts bone strength. In this study, muscle power was assessed in male and female adolescents by the vertical jump and bone strength was assessed at two locations on the tibia by pQCT. Strong and consistent associations were determined between the muscle power and bone strength measures of the cortical area (CoA), strength during compression (BSI) and strength during torsion (SSIp). The authors recommended that muscle power should be included as a component of health-related fitness and bone-enhancing health programs and as such that vertical jump become part of the battery of health-related physical fitness tests.




Factors Influencing Bone Health




Bone health is related to the mass, strength, and stiffness of bone (Burr, 2011
) and is influenced by many factors, including nutrition, hormonal status, body composition, and physical activity. Bone health is largely related to peak bone mass attainment and bone loss rate. Both processes are influenced by age and sex.


Age-Related Changes in Bone


Bone changes in density throughout life. Figure 16.9
 shows the characteristic pattern between bone mass and age for males and females (Ott, 1990). The first 20 years of life are characterized by active growth in bone mass. About 25% of the final adult bone is accumulated from approximately 11.5–13.5 years (around the age of menarche) for girls and 13.0–15.0 (peri- to postpuberty) for boys. This approximates the amount of bone lost in females in postmenopausal years (MacKelvie et al., 2003
). The skeletal consolidation phase occurs in early adulthood, and peak bone mass is generally attained by 30 years. Shortly after attainment of peak bone mass, bone mass loss begins. After a rapid-loss phase, the rate of bone loss decreases (Teitelbaum, 1993
). The theoretical curves shown in Figure 16.9
 assume the attainment of full genetic potential. If environmental factors such as exercise, nutrition, and hormonal status are inadequate, full genetic potential for bone mass may not be realized, increasing fracture risk (Heaney et al., 2000
). The specific effect of aging is difficult to know precisely because bone health is affected by many factors, especially physical activity level and nutritional patterns (Tucker et al., 2002
; Wohl et al., 2000
).









FIGURE 16.9
 Comparison of BMD for Females and Males.
 Bone mineral density values change throughout the life span. Female values are influenced by hormonal status.




Male-Female Differences in Bone Mineral Density


BMD varies between males and females. As shown in Figure 16.9
, total BMD changes throughout the life span for both sexes. Bone mineral density increases throughout childhood and early adult life for both sexes, but the peak bone mineral density attained is less in females than males (Rizzoli 2014a
).



In addition to differences in total BMD, BMD also varies between males and females according to measurement site.
 
Table 16.3


 compares adult BMD at various sites for men and women (

Beck and Marcus, 1999

).

.




At menopause, females lose the protective influence of estrogen, and bone loss accelerates if estrogen is not pharmacologically replaced. On average, annual bone loss is 2–3% during the first few years following menopause, and 0.5–1% thereafter (Rizzoli et al., 2014
). The loss of the protective influence of estrogen and accompanying bone loss explains the prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in older postmenopausal women.


Development of Peak Bone Mass


Peak bone mass is attained during the mid-30s in both sexes, although 95% of peak bone mass is achieved by age 20 (Beck and Marcus, 1999
). The individual’s peak bone mass developed in young adulthood is influenced by mechanical factors, nutrition, hormonal levels, and genetics (Heaney et al., 2000
; Rizzoli 2014a
). Mechanical factors include physical activity and gravity. These forces are generally considered necessary stimuli for bone formation and growth (Frost, 1997
). Studies done with astronauts and with individuals confined to bed rest clearly show a loss of bone mineral density when bone is not subjected to the force of gravity.



Although additional research is needed to specify exercise prescriptions for optimal skeletal development, children and adolescents should be encouraged to engage in physical activity to promote bone health along with other positive changes and development within the body. Specifically for bone development, children and adolescents should be encouraged to participate in high-impact activities (

Greene and Naughton, 2006

;
 
Khan et al., 2001b

;
 
Macdonald et al., 2007

;
 
Tenforde et al., 2015

;
 
Vicente-Rodriguez, 2006

). Puberty is a particularly important time period for the development of bone mass; bone size, mass, and BMD increase approximately 4% per year from childhood to late adolescence and early adulthood (

Ackerman and Misra, 2011

;
 
Matkovic and Visy, 2015

). For girls, peak BMC velocity occurs on the average at about age 12.7 years (the average age of menarche); for boys it occurs about 1.5 years later. Of course, maturational age varies widely among individuals. Specific exercises for bone development are generally important from approximately 9–16 years.




Adequate nutrition is necessary for developing a strong skeletal system. Dietary protein, calcium and adequate vitamin D are essential for bone health but are often deficient in young athletes.
 
Table 16.4

 shows the recommended Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of calcium and vitamin D. Note that these are adequate intake (AI) values, that is, recommended amounts based on observed or experimentally determined approximations from healthy individuals when a more specific recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has not been determined. Unfortunately, many individuals fall well below the recommendations. In particular, young women who are concerned about weight control often restrict dietary intake, leading to low calcium and vitamin D intake. For instance, young women may eliminate dairy products from their diet because they are high in fat. But dairy products also are an excellent source of calcium, vitamin D, and protein, all of which are essential to the development of good bone health. Thus, while trying to maintain weight, these athletes may be negatively affecting the attainment of peak bone mass. Exercise professionals must consider the need for dietary calcium, vitamin D, and protein when counseling young athletes (particularly females) about weight management (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Rizzoli, 2014a

). The availability of the many low-fat dairy products makes including calcium in the diet easier. Importantly, fortified dietary products result in more favorable changes in biochemical markers of bone metabolism than does supplementation alone, suggesting that dietary sources of these nutrients are more effective than simply taking

 a pill (

Rizzoli, 2014b

). Recommendations for play and exercise outdoors may also help increase the synthesis of vitamin D.

As mentioned previously, adequate estrogen levels are also needed to attain peak bone mass. This is discussed further in relation to older adults and female athletes later in this chapter.




Finally, there are genetically determined limits to the amount of BMD that an individual can attain. The only way to achieve genetic potential, however, is to pay careful attention to modifiable factors: nutritional status, hormonal status, and activity level.





Exercise Response




Physical activity increases mechanical forces on bones. This leads to physiological changes in bone cells that allow bone to be modeled and remodeled. Mechanotransduction
 is the process by which a bone responds to a mechanical force on it. Mechanical forces are converted into biological signals (primarily by osteocytes) that signal bone remodeling by osteoblast activity and osteoclast resorption (Bonnet and Ferrari, 2010
; Klein-Nulend et al., 2015
). As illustrated in Figure 16.10
, physical activity applies a mechanical force (e.g., bending or deformation) to bone. Bending causes both compressive
 and tensile
 stress that alters the hydrostatic pressure in different regions of the bone tissue, causing movement of fluid in this tissue. Fluid flows through the small canals and spaces within the bone matrix (lacunocanalicular system) and around osteocytes; this flow aids in the transport of nutrients and waste. This fluid movement also exerts a shear stress that may stimulate an osteogenic response, resulting in the formation of new bone.









FIGURE 16.10
 Effect of Bending Force on Bone Physiology.
 Bending creates both compressive and tensile forces. Compression creates high hydrostatic pressure that facilitates movement of bone fluid to the area of tension, which has low hydrostatic pressure. The movement of fluid through the lacunocanalicular system aids in nutrient delivery and waste removal and plays an important role in the osteogenic response to loading. Source

Physical activity causes specific changes in bone physiology within minutes. Soon after a mechanical load is placed on bone cells, they release prostacyclin; this is followed within minutes by an increase in enzymes related to metabolism. Six to twenty-four hours after activity, RNA synthesis increases. There is evidence of increased collagen and mineral deposition on the bone surface within 3–5 days after a bout of loading (

Khan et al., 2001c

). The relationship between levels of blood biomarkers of bone turnover and structural and mineral adaptations of bone continues to be an area of research (

Lester et al., 2009

;
 
Maïmoun and Sultan, 2011

).

Application of the Training Principles





Bone’s adaptation to physical activity depends on the type of loading. In other words, the response is specific to the type of activity performed. Stress (or load) refers to the external force applied to a bone, whereas strain (deformation) refers to changes in the bone tissue. Adaptations in any given physiological system are dependent on the extent to which exercise stresses that system. For instance, adaptations in the cardiovascular system depend on the intensity, duration, and frequency of predominantly aerobic exercise training. Similarly adaptations in skeletal muscle depend on the load, number of reps, rest period, number of sets, and frequency that load-bearing exercise is performed. The adaptation to a mechanical load (physical activity) in bone depends on the strain magnitude, strain rate, distribution of load on the bone, and number of cycles (Khan et al., 2001a
). Strain magnitude
 is the amount of relative change in bone length under mechanical loading. Strain rate
 is the speed at which strain develops and releases. Distribution of load
 refers to how strain occurs across a section of bone. Strain cycles
 are the number of load repetitions.



The
 mechanostat theory
, shown in
 
Figure 16.11

, suggests that bone adapts to set points of
 minimal effective strain (MES)
. This theory suggests that a control system operates in which an MES is necessary to maintain bone and that a higher MES must be surpassed to overload bone appropriately for positive adaptations (increased bone mineral density and strength). Above the repair MES, bone enters a state of overuse. In the pathological overuse zone, bone suffers from microdamage, and woven

 (unorganized) bone is added as part of the repair process, leading to increased bone mass but not bone strength (

Khan et al., 2001a

).

The precise type and amount of activity for enhancing and maintaining bone health is not fully known at present. However, several recommendations can be made based on the mechanostat theory and research. The overall goals of physical activity relative to skeletal health are to (1) increase peak bone mass in adolescents, (2) minimize age-related bone loss, and (3) prevent falls and fractures (

ACSM, 2004

).



Specificity


The specificity principle applies to the particular bones being stressed, the composition of the bone being stressed (cortical versus trabecular), and the type of activity being performed. Research data suggest that the type of exercise or activity performed greatly influences skeletal adaptations. Weight-bearing exercise
 refers to movement in which the body weight is supported by muscles and bones, thereby working against gravity. Non–weight-bearing exercise
, in contrast, refers to movement in which the body is supported or suspended and thereby not working against the pull of gravity. Weight-bearing or impact-loading activities, such as running, gymnastics, stair climbing, volleyball, and resistance training, are more likely to stimulate increased bone mass than non–weight-bearing activities, such as swimming and cycling (ACSM, 2004
; Duncan et al., 2002
; Proctor et al., 2002
; Tenforde et al., 2015
). The best activity is chosen based on the individual’s health and preference. When considering exercise for individuals with low bone mineral content, the risk of falling and causing a fracture is a major concern. Activities with a high risk of falls or collisions should not be recommended for certain populations, such as older adults. Table 16.5
 provides general guidelines for types of activities appropriate for various groups (ACSM, 2004
).



TABLE 16.5
 Recommended Activities for Skeletal Health







Because dynamic resistance training is associated with positive adaptations in skeletal tissue as well as muscular fitness, exercise physiologists generally recommend this type of exercise for maintaining both muscular and skeletal health (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Layne and Nelson, 1999

). Loading seems to have a localized effect (
Wolff’s law
); thus, specific sites can be isolated for impact. Conversely, a general dynamic resistance program that works all the major muscles of the body should benefit the total skeleton. Note that bone tissue does not appear to respond to static resistance exercise (

Turner and Robling, 2003

).

Proposed “Osteogenic Index” to Measure the Effectiveness of Exercise on Bone Formation






Some researchers think that bone cells exhibit a desensitization when mechanical loading sessions are extended. Turner and Robling (2003)
 developed an “osteogenic index” (OI) to determine the effectiveness of the stimulation for bone formation based on the number of repetitions of high-impact exercise (such as jumping) per session and per week. This is presented in the figure below.







In this figure, the cycles·wk
−1
 refers to the number of jumps completed. Such mild-impact loading represents three times the body weight. The dashed horizontal line represents the OI generated by 20 minutes of walking 5 d·wk
−1
 (800 load cycles per leg at 1.1 times body weight). According to this instrument, the OI increases threefold if the exercise is administered 5 d·wk
−1
 as opposed to 1 d·wk
−1
. Clearly, based on this tool, adding more sessions per week improved the OI more than did lengthening the exercise session by the number of jump cycles. Furthermore, the OI is increased as much as an additional 50% if the daily exercise is divided into two shorter sessions separated by 8 hours. However, dividing the exercises into three sessions separated by 4 hours does not achieve a better OI. If the theory proposed by these researchers proves correct and the OI is a valuable tool for measuring bone stimulation, then load-induced bone formation would be enhanced by regimens that incorporate rest periods between short vigorous bouts. For example, running short sprints should build more bone than an endurance run.

Overloa
d


As mentioned earlier, weight-bearing exercises result in positive skeletal adaptations. As shown in Figure 16.11
, the threshold for a stimulus that initiates new bone formation is termed the minimal effective strain (MES) for remodeling (Frost, 1997
). A load or force that exceeds this threshold and is repeated a sufficient number of times is thought to cause osteoblasts to secrete osteoid and lead to the formation of new bone. The MES for bone modeling, and thus the impact load necessary to induce positive skeletal adaptations in humans, is not precisely known, but the stimulus must include forces considerably greater than those of habitual activity. There is strong evidence that weight-bearing, impact-loading exercises can lead to an increase in bone mineral density in children and adolescents and also decrease the age-related loss of bone mineral density in adulthood (ACSM, 2004
; Borer, 2005
; NIH 2001
).



Impact loads, and thus the strain applied to bones, can be manipulated by increasing repetitions or by increasing the strain magnitude as measured by ground reaction force or joint force. For example, running loads bones by high repetition, whereas rope jumping overloads the bones primarily by intensity (strain magnitude). For adaptations in skeletal tissue, intensity is apparently more important than repetition (

Beck and Marcus, 1999

;
 
Kato et al., 2006

). Just 10 maximal vertical jumps per day, 3 days per week for 6 months has been shown to significantly increase bone mineral density in college-aged women (

Kato et al., 2006

).




Until the amount of exercise needed to impose an overload is known, the rate of adaptation or the ideal progression necessary to induce additional gains in bone density cannot be determined. However, any type of exercise overload (intensity, duration, or frequency) must begin at a level the individual can safely tolerate and progress gradually. Skeletal adaptations are unique in terms of the slow turnover rate of bone. Because it takes about 3–4 months for one remodeling cycle to complete the sequence of bone resorption, formation, and mineralization, a minimum of 6–8 months of exercise training are typically required to detect a measurable change in bone mass in humans, using current technology (

ACSM, 2004

).



Rest/Recovery/Adaptation


It has been difficult to quantify the osteogenic stimuli needed to result in positive bone adaptations in humans and to determine the optimal amount of rest and recovery for positive bone adaptations. Some researchers
 have used information from animal studies to develop an osteogenic index (see Focus on Application box) to guide exercise prescription for bone adaptations. This osteogenic index has proven useful in quantifying training load in intervention studies (Kishimoto et al., 2012
; Lester et al., 2009
) and previous sporting activity in retrospective studies (Kato et al., 2015
). Although research to determine the precise amount of overload required to lead to positive bone adaptation is a continuing area of research, a review of literature has shown that high-impact loading (e.g., gymnastics, hurdling, karate, volleyball and other jumping sports) and odd-impact loading (e.g., soccer, basketball, racket games, and speed skating) are associated with higher bone mineral density and enhanced bone geometry (Tenforde and Fredericson, 2011
). It is known that inadequate rest and recovery along with excessive repetitive loads can lead to stress fractures (discussed later in this chapter).


Individualization


The individual response principle applies to the skeletal system as well as other body systems; that is, different people respond to the same exercise stress differently depending on their genetic makeup, hormonal and nutritional status, and so on. Individuals with low BMD have the greatest potential for benefit.



Additionally, exercise interventions goals vary for individuals across the life span. During childhood, the primary goal is to improve bone acquisition and attain the highest peak bone mass genetically possible. High-impact activities, such as jumping, hopping, and ball sports that incorporate high-impact, multidirectional loading, should be incorporated into activity starting in the prepubertal years (

Tenforde et al., 2015

). It has been shown that as little as 10 minutes of high-impact circuit training during Physical Education class performed 3 days a week over 2 years resulted in significantly greater improvement in bone mineral content in young girls (mean age = 9.9 years) than in age-matched controls (

MacKelvie et al., 2003

). The goal through early adulthood is to build bone and through middle age to maintain bone. This requires weight-bearing activity with a force of impact greater than 2.5 times body weight. For older adults, the goal is to reduce bone loss and prevent falls. This means emphasizing activities that challenge the postural system and use resistance for loading muscles and bone. Dynamic resistance programs should promote balance and upper and lower body muscle strength to reduce the risk of falling and possible resulting bone fractures. Osteoporotic individuals should not engage in jumping activities. Although walking in itself is not a strong bone stimulus (see Focus on Application box), a lifetime of walking may beneficially reduce bone loss (

Beck and Snow, 2003

).



Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


The reversibility principle suggests that if you cease exercising for a time, you lose the benefits of exercising. Studies of immobilized patients (Donaldson et al., 1970
; Vogel and Whittle, 1976
) and discontinued training (Dalsky et al., 1988
; Iwamoto et al., 2001
; Nordström et al., 2005
; Winters and Snow, 2000
) indicate that this principle also applies to bone. The effects of detraining on bone are discussed later in this chapter.


Maintenance


The increased BMD resulting from exercise training appears to be reduced with the cessation of training. The rate of bone loss is not known, however, nor is the level of activity needed to maintain bone mineral density or the threshold at which bone loss occurs. Intense exercise training during the pubertal years and early adulthood may lead to greater attainment of peak bone mass, which may protect against fractures later in life because more bone mass can be lost then before the bone is weakened to the point of fracture (Heaney et al., 2000
; Karlsson, 2004
). There is evidence that increases in BMC in the femoral neck gained during 7 months of high-impact training in prepubertal children were maintained during a 7-month detraining period (Fuchs and Snow, 2002
). Clearly, activity is needed to maintain BMD, but additional research is necessary to determine the level of activity in various age groups for maintaining improvements in bone mineral density that resulted from exercise training.


Warm-Up and Cooldown


The effect of warming up and cooling down on bone density is not known. However, warming up and stretching are important for ligaments and tendons, which are part of the skeletal system.



In summary, the optimal exercise prescription for skeletal health varies over the life span, and research continues to further elucidate what types of activity are most effective for enhancing bone health. Clearly, weight-bearing or impact-loading exercise is beneficial, and most healthy individuals should undertake an exercise program using weight-bearing activity and dynamic resistance exercise.





Skeletal Adaptations to Exercise Training




The adaptation of the skeletal system to exercise training is depicted in Table 16.6
. As the table indicates, the adaptation of bone to exercise depends largely on the amount of activity and may be represented as a continuum. Measurable skeletal adaptation also depends on the type of bone being measured (trabecular or cortical) as well as the type of activity employed.

 Effects of Physical Activity and Exercise Training on Bone Health










FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Plyometrics






Again, high-impact activities are thought to be the key for bone development. Plyometrics
 is an exercise training method originally designed to develop explosive power. It consists of exercises involving powerful contractions following dynamic loading or prestretching of the contracting muscles. Plyometrics depth jumps can produce ground reaction forces of up to seven times body weight. In terms of skeletal loading, ground reaction forces less than two times body weight are considered to be low intensity, ground reaction forces two to four times body weight are moderate intensity, and ground reaction forces greater than four times body weight constitute a high-intensity load (Witzke and Snow, 2000
). Thus, plyometrics provides a potentially excellent training modality for building bone mineral density.







Basic plyometric exercises include all the following:









Bounds for horizontal distance






Jumps for vertical height






Hops for vertical height as rapidly as possible






Leaps for maximal vertical plus horizontal distance






Skips for vertical height plus horizontal distance






Ricochets for rapid leg and foot movement while minimizing vertical and horizontal distance






Swings for trunk movements with involvement of shoulders and arms






Twists for lateral movement without shoulder or arm involvement









A program of plyometrics can be used with individuals as young as 12 years of age if designed carefully and applied progressively (

Radcliffe and Farentinos, 1985

).
 
Witzke and Snow (2000)

 implemented a plyometrics training program in a freshman physical education class (3 d·wk
−1
, 30–45 min·d
−1
, for 9 months). All participants volunteered for this class. Despite the fact that the control subjects in a “traditional” physical education class were active more hours per week outside class than the plyometrics exercisers (5.6 vs. 2.6 hr·wk
−1
), the plyometrics exercisers had greater increases in bone mass measured at all sites. However, the difference between groups was statistically significant at only one site, the greater trochanter. The researchers reported that although some students worked harder in class than others, most enjoyed the plyometrics class and participated in it safely. Only one injury occurred during the entire program. Thus, plyometrics training may be a viable alternative activity for junior and senior high school physical education classes or after-school programs in fitness facilities. The implementation of such programs requires a knowledgeable instructor and a conscientiously constructed training program.

One approach to studying the effects of increased physical activity on bone density is to compare the dominant limb to the nondominant limb in sports such as tennis and baseball. These studies report that the dominant arm has greater bone mineral density or mass than does

 the nondominant arm (

Huddleston et al., 1980

;
 
Jones et al., 1977

;
 
Kontulainen et al., 2002

). This seems true for both females and males and across a wide age range. Furthermore, the difference in BMD between the dominant and nondominant arm appears related to the age at which participants started playing the sport.
 
Kontulainen et al. (2002)

 have reported that BMD measures of the humerus of the dominant arm are approximately 17% greater than those in the nondominant arm in racquet sport players who began playing before menarche, compared to a 9% difference between dominant and nondominant limbs in players who began playing after menarche. The control group of nonathletic individuals evidenced a 3% difference in BMD between the dominant and nondominant arm (

Kontulainen et al., 2002

).




Another approach to studying skeletal adaptations to exercise training has been to compare different athletic groups with one another and with control groups (see accompanying Focus on Research). These studies collectively suggest that individuals involved in athletics or participating in vigorous fitness training have greater bone mineral density than do sedentary controls. Furthermore, individuals involved in weight-bearing or impact-loading sports have higher BMD than do those involved in non–weight-bearing activities (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Duncan et al., 2002

;
 
Prelack et al., 2012

;
 
Proctor et al., 2002

;
 
Riser et al., 1990

).




Training studies have also been conducted of sedentary individuals beginning an exercise program. BMD measurements were compared before and after the exercise training. A review of 21 longitudinal studies in which participants were randomly assigned to exercise treatment or control groups strongly suggests that regular physical exercise can delay the physiological decrease in bone mineral density that occurs with aging and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Weight-bearing exercises, including weight lifting, jumping, and running, were associated with the greatest improvements in bone mass (

Ernst, 1998

).




Skeletal adaptation to exercise depends on the age of the participant. Vigorous exercise helps increase bone mass and strength in children and is thus important for the attainment of peak bone mass. Furthermore, bone mass tracks from childhood to adulthood, as shown by the following studies. One study (

Barnekow-Bergkvist et al., 2006

) tested female students at age 16.1 and 20 years later. Active girls had higher BMD than inactive girls as adolescents. Those who continued to be active in weight-bearing activity had significantly higher BMD (5–19%) in adulthood than did those who ceased participation or who had never been active. Membership in a sports club and site-specific physical performance in adolescence were significantly associated with higher adult BMD. Another study (

Delvaux et al., 2001

) tested males at ages 13 and 40 years. Static arm strength, running speed, and upper body muscular endurance as an adolescent contributed significantly to the prediction of adult bone mass. Additionally, no consistent evidence suggests that exercise training negatively affects either skeletal maturation (measured by ossification) or bone length in growing children. Although isolated studies have shown both retarded and accelerated growth in stature in young

 athletes, the consensus is that youngsters involved in exercise training grow at the same rate and to the same extent as do their sedentary counterparts (

Baxter-Jones and Maffulli, 2002

;
 
Caine, 1990

;
 
Malina, 1988

;
 
Plowman et al., 1991

;
 
Sprynarova, 1987

).




A study by
 
Welsh and Rutherford (1996)

 suggests that elderly men and women respond to exercise in a similar manner. High-impact aerobics, performed 2–3 d·wk
−1
, resulted in an increase in total body BMD and in hip and spine BMD. The increase in BMD was similar for the males and females who participated in the 12-month study.




Overall, studies suggest that weight-bearing and resistance exercise training play an important role in maximizing bone mass during childhood and adolescence, increasing or maintaining bone mass through adulthood, attenuating bone loss with aging, and reducing falls and fractures in the elderly (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Polidoulis et al., 2012

). However, if some is good, more is not necessarily better when it comes to exercise training and bone health. Excessive physical activity, noted as the pathological overload zone in
 
Figure 16.11

, can exceed the adaptive ability of bone, resulting in overuse injuries.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Gymnastics Are Associated with Higher Upper Limb BMD






To examine the effect of high-impact-loading forces on BMD, Proctor and colleagues examined female college gymnasts (NCAA Division I) and age- and weight-matched controls. Gymnastics is a unique sport because the limbs of the upper body are weight-bearing and subject to high-impact loading.







Following are the BMD figures of the gymnasts and controls.








As found in earlier studies focusing on the lower body of weight-bearing athletes, this study found that gymnasts had higher BMD values at the lumbar spine and femur than did controls. The major new finding was that female collegiate gymnasts had 17% higher arm BMD than did controls. Furthermore, while the control group had the typical pattern of slightly greater BMD in the dominant arm, this difference was not evident in the gymnasts.








These results are consistent with the mechanostat theory and suggest that gymnastic training provides a sufficient training stimulus (overload) to elicit positive bone adaptations.

Skeletal Adaptations to Detraining




Research clearly shows that a cessation of weight-bearing exercise is detrimental to the skeleton because it results in a loss of bone mineral density. This effect has been clearly shown in astronauts and in patients confined to bed rest or immobilized in a cast. Studies have consistently indicated that weight-bearing bones are affected more and that trabecular bone (measured in the spine) is lost at a greater rate than cortical bone (Donaldson et al., 1970
; Frost, 1988
; Vogel and Whittle, 1976
).



Research also suggests that discontinuing weight-bearing exercise results in a loss of the positive adaptation that occurs with training. Detraining was associated with a reversal of the positive effects of exercise on bone in young adult males 3 years after discontinuing intense hockey training (

Nordström et al., 2005

), in premenopausal women after 6 months of detraining following a year of impact and resistance training (

Winters and Snow, 2000

), and in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis after 1 year of detraining following a year of walking and gymnastic exercises (

Iwamoto et al., 2001

).




In a classic study that investigated changes in bone mineral content with training and subsequent detraining,
 
Dalsky et al. (1988)

 reported that 22 months of weight-bearing exercise caused a significant increase (6.2%) in lumbar bone mineral content. When subjects discontinued exercise training (or trained <3 d·wk
−1
), bone mineral content returned to baseline values. After 1 year of detraining, bone mineral content was only 1.1% above baseline values. Collective data strongly suggest that the increased bone mineral resulting from exercise is lost if exercise is not continued; bone responds to activity and to inactivity.





Special Applications to Health and Fitness




The following sections discuss three practical implications of skeletal health of special interest to those involved in health and fitness: osteoporosis, the female athlete triad (a portion of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport Syndrome), and skeletal injuries.


Osteoporosis


Osteoporosis is a serious health problem affecting millions of Americans. An estimated 10 million individuals already have the disease, and an estimated additional 43 million have low bone mass placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis (Cosman et al., 2014
; National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2012
). Osteoporosis, meaning “porous bones,” is a condition characterized by compromised bone strength that increases the risk of fracture. Bone strength is determined by both bone density and bone quality (including external geometry and internal microstructure) (Seeman and Delmas, 2006
). Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation and is characterized by low bone mass and increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture (Klein-Nulend et al., 2015
). Low bone mass, or bone mineral density, occurs because resorption occurs faster than formation. Clinically, osteoporosis is defined by a BMD more than 2.5 SD (T-score ≥ −2.5) below the young normal adult average (Kanis et al., 1993
). Figure 16.12
 shows normal and osteoporotic trabecular bone. Note the more porous trabeculae in the osteoporotic bone, a condition that weakens the bone.













FIGURE 16.12
 Trabecular Bone.
 A. Normal. B. Osteoporotic.





The most common fracture sites related to osteoporosis are the hip, spine, and wrist. Additionally, spinal vertebral fractures occur when an osteoporotic bone is literally crushed by the weight of the body, resulting in a loss of height, curvature of the spine, and considerable pain. The number, cost, and consequences of fracture warrant concern. Approximately 300,000 hip, 550,000 vertebral, and 400,000 wrist osteoporosis-related fractures occur each year in the United States (

Burge et al., 2007

). Hip fractures are associated with an excess mortality rate of 8–36% during the first year after fracture (

Abrahamsen et al., 2009

) and the greatest medical costs of osteoporotic fractures (

Budhia et al., 2012

). From 2009 to 2011, the total aggregate costs for individuals with an osteoporotic condition were $70.5 billion (

United States Bone and Joint Initiative, 2015

).




The cause of osteoporosis is not known, although several risk factors have been identified (

Table 16.7

) (

Carmona, 2004

;
 
NIH, 2015

). Genetic risk factors include sex, race, heredity, and body build. Women are more likely to develop osteoporosis; Caucasians and individuals of Asian descent have a higher risk; those with a parent with osteoporosis are more likely to develop osteoporosis; and a small body frame (low body mass index [BMI]) is associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fracture in the elderly. Low BMI may result in several factors, including low BMD, less soft tissue to protect bone

 from impact forces, and an increased risk of falling due to muscle weakness (

Nielson et al., 2012

). Nutritional risk factors include low calcium intake, excessive alcohol consumption, and consistently high protein intake. Lifestyle factors associated with osteoporosis include a lack of physical activity and smoking. Physiological factors include inadequate levels of estrogen (related to a delayed menarche, amenorrhea, or an early menopause). Several research studies have indicated that the rapid loss of BMD following menopause is related to the decrease in estrogen levels. The low activity levels of females in the United States, particularly older women, also contribute to the risk of developing osteoporosis. Bone mineral content is positively related to long-term physical activity.




TABLE 16.7
 Risk Factors Associated with Osteoporosis







The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that older adults acquire 150 min·wk
−1
 of physical activity. If older adults are not able to achieve 150 min·wk
−1

 of moderate-intensity activity because of chronic health conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow (

ACSM, 2009

). These recommendations are made based on the understanding of multiple benefits of exercise, including enhancing bone health. In addition to its positive effect on BMD, exercise also appears to help reduce the risk of fractures by increasing muscular strength and coordination, thereby decreasing the risk of falling (

Kemmler et al., 2010

). The risk of falling is affected by the individual’s coordination, sight, and muscular strength. Environmental risk factors that increase the risk of falling include poor lighting, uneven or slippery floor surfaces, and inappropriate footwear. Exercise leaders must provide an exercise area that reduces the risk of falling for older adults.




While it is clear that physical activity is important for maintaining bone health in older adults, nutritional factors also play a role. Calcium and vitamin D have a permissive effect on bone that acts synergistically with exercise to influence bone remodeling. There is no evidence that excessive amounts of calcium or vitamin D will result in greater skeletal gains, and in the absence of exercise, nutritional factors cannot adequately maintain bone mass or strength. However, adequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D and protein are independently important for bone health (

Daly and Kukuljan, 2010

;
 
Rizzoli et al., 2014

).



The Female Athlete Triad: A portion of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport Syndrome


Postmenopausal females are not the only people at risk for developing osteoporosis and subsequent bone fractures. So too are young female athletes who exhibit components of a medical syndrome known as the female athlete triad (Ackerman and Misra, 2011
; ACSM, 2007
; Beals and Meyer, 2007
; DeSouza and Williams, 2004
; International Olympic Committee, 2006
).



The
 female athlete triad
 was first recognized as a syndrome in 1997. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) published a position stand on it. In 2007, the American College of Sports medicine refined the syndrome as the condition presented in
 
Figure 16.13

. That is, the syndrome was seen clinically as a collection of interrelated conditions including disordered eating (DE), menstrual dysfunction, and skeletal demineralization. The syndrome was originally narrowly defined in terms of the extremes of each of these conditions, but by 2007 it was recognized that each condition ranged along a continuum from health to disease with interaction between the factors (

Beals and Meyer, 2007

;
 
DeSouza et al., 2014

;
 
Loucks, 2003b

;
 
Zach et al., 2011

). Thus, disordered eating was seen as being directly related to both menstrual dysfunction and skeletal demineralization, while menstrual dysfunction in turn impacted skeletal demineralization. Now, however, there is compelling evidence that low energy availability resulting from disordered eating (DE) or a diagnosed eating disorder (ED) is THE underlying factor in the female athlete triad.

 Moreover, as detailed in
 
Chapter 6

 (

Figure 6.11

), the resultant psychological/physiological, fitness/performance and medical issues resulting from DE/ED are probably not confined to just menstrual dysfunction and bone demineralization. Many more systems and functions are impacted by low energy availability. Furthermore, male athletes can also be affected, although the triad components would be different (

Bratland-Sanda & Sundgot-Borgen, 2013

;
 
Loucks et al., 2006

). These findings have led the International Olympic Committee expert panel to introduce a broader, more comprehensive term for the condition previously known as the female athlete triad. That term is the
 Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport syndrome (RED-S)
 (

Mountjoy et al., 2014

) and, again, this is discussed fully in Ch. 6. However, this does not negate the interaction between low energy deficiency and menstrual and bone health. For purposes of this chapter, the discussion will center around the impact of low energy availability and menstrual disruption on bone health for females. More research is needed on the possible male athlete triad.










FIGURE 16.13
 The Female Athlete Triad.
 The female athlete triad is a portion of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport syndrome whose underlying causal factor is some degree of disordered eating that brings about menstrual dysfunction, and skeletal demineralization. In the extreme, these conditions can result in a diagnosed eating disorder, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. The arrows indicate that disordered eating can directly impact both menstrual dysfunction and skeletal demineralization whereas menstrual dysfunction directly impacts only skeletal demineralization.

Low Energy Availability



Energy availability (EA)
 is defined as the amount of dietary energy remaining for all other metabolic processes after the energy cost of training is subtracted from the daily energy intake. This is the amount of dietary energy remaining for all other physiological functions. Humans need dietary energy for five functions: cellular maintenance, thermoregulation, movement, growth, and reproduction. If a large proportion of the available energy is used for movement (exercise training), there may be insufficient energy available for the other functions. Reproductive functions seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of insufficient energy although more readily perceived in the female than male (Bratland-Sanda & Sundgot-Borgen, 2013
).





Female Athlete Triad
 A portion of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport syndrome that includes the interrelated conditions of disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and skeletal demineralization.



Energy Availability (EA)
 The amount of dietary energy remaining for all other metabolic processes after the energy cost of training is subtracted from the daily energy intake.





In exercising females, reproductive function and bone turnover are impaired when energy availability is decreased more than 33%. Many amenorrheic athletes decrease their energy availability by 67%, well over the threshold 33%. The threshold for sufficient energy availability appears to be approximately 30 kcal·kg LBM
−1
·d
−1
. Thus, female runners may be able to sustain normal reproductive hormonal function while running up to 8 mi·d
−1
 as long as they maintain a dietary energy intake of at least 45 kcal·kg LBM
−1
·d
−1
 (

Ihle and Loucks, 2004

;
 
Loucks et al., 2006

;
 
Loucks and Thuma, 2003

;
 
Sungot-Borgen et al., 2013

).







Example






For example, if the runner were 125 lb (56.8 kg) with a body fat of 20%, she would have 25 lb (11.4 kg) of fat and 100 lb (45.4 kg) of lean body mass (LBM). Multiplying 45.4 kg by 45 kcal·kg LBM−1
·d−1
 indicates she requires a caloric intake of 2,043 kcal·d−1
.







If this athlete is only ingesting 1,200 kcal·d
−1
, she has a deficit of 843 kcal·d
−1
. Among the results of such insufficient energy availability are impaired bone health and the possibility of increased stress fractures.







Menstrual Dysfunction


Menstrual dysfunction is one mechanism through which low energy availability is thought to impact bone health. It is thought that insufficient fuel (especially carbohydrate) to meet energy requirements causes a change in brain function. The female reproductive system is controlled by the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis. A key role is the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Low energy availability somehow decreases GnRH release. Inadequate GnRH results in the suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which causes, in turn, inadequate secretion of estrogen (estradiol) and progesterone. The resultant disruptions in menstrual function can include (1) luteal suppression (phase defects in which ovulation occurs but implantation cannot), (2) anovulation, (3) oligomenorrhea (irregular and inconsistent menstrual cycles), and (4) amenorrhea. Amenorrhea may be either primary (the failure to achieve menarche by age 15) or secondary (no menses for a minimum of 3 consecutive months in a female who has attained menarche) (DeSouza and Williams, 2004
; Loucks et al., 2006
).



While the athlete often feels the absence of a regular menstrual cycle is a good thing, physiologically it is not. A major concern with amenorrhea is that the low levels of circulating estrogen (hypoestrogenia) can negatively impact bone (

Giannopoulou and Kanaly, 2004

). This is true for both primary amenorrhea (almost half of bone mass accrual occurs during adolescence and young adulthood) and secondary amenorrhea. An athlete who misses more than six consecutive menstrual periods has increased risk of failure to reach potential peak bone mass or premature bone loss. Indeed, athletes should have a BMD similar to or higher than (depending on the site and sport) sedentary individuals and nonmenstruating athletes, not lower, and regularly do (

Ackerman and Misra, 2011

;
 
Beals and Meyer, 2007

;
 
DeSouza and Williams, 2004

;

;
 
International Olympic Committee, 2006

).
 
Figure 16.14

 presents data on bone mineral density at several sites in amenorrheic and eumenorrheic (regular menstrual cycling) athletes. This study demonstrates the important point that amenorrhea results in lower BMD at multiple sites.

Skeletal Demineralization


Given the relationship between menstrual function and bone health, the International Olympic Committee
 (IOC, 2006
; Sungot-Borgen et al., 2013
) suggests that any athlete identified with a current or past history of oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, or fractures be further evaluated. Their osteoporosis decision tree is presented in Figure 16.15
. Note that the IOC recommends that individuals with a Z-score of −1 or lower be referred for counseling or treatment. A Z-score of −2.0 or lower in an amenorrheic athlete 20 years of age or older is considered to be osteoporotic, placing the athlete at risk for fractures (Beals and Meyer, 2007
; International Olympic Committee, 2006
).

 Osteoporosis Decision Tree.
 Algorithm to decide whether an athlete needs evaluation and possibly treatment for low bone density.





The link between skeletal demineralization and low energy availability may be a dose-response relationship. A study by
 
Ihle and Loucks (2004)

 showed that markers of
 bone formation
 were suppressed at moderate levels of energy restriction, whereas markers of
 bone resorption
 increased only when the energy restriction was severe enough to suppress estrogen. The primary role of estrogen in bone metabolism is to reduce the rate of bone resorption (

Loucks, 2003b

). Low energy availability likely initially affects metabolic substrates and hormones other than estrogen (insulin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, cortisol, leptin, and thyroid) that are important in bone metabolism and, then, with more severe energy restriction, impacts estrogen as well (

DeSouza and Williams, 2004

).




Note that although exercise is a stressor and thus elicits neurohormonal responses in the body, exercise itself does not appear to cause the female athlete triad beyond the impact of its energy cost on energy availability. No particular body weight or body composition appears to be a critical threshold level beyond which a disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis occurs. Eumenorrheic and amenorrheic athletes both span a common range of body weight and composition (

Beals and Meyer, 2007

;
 
Loucks, 2003a

,
 
2003b

). However, athletes with a body mass index (BMI) lower than 18.5 kg
.
m
−2
 (M & F) or body fat of less than 12% (F) or less than 5% (M) should be closely monitored (

Sungot-Borgen et al., 2013

). Finally, while estrogen is important for both menstrual and bone health, estrogen supplementation alone has not been shown to restore BMD to normal in amenorrheic athletes. The Clinically Relevant Focus on Research box presents a case study demonstrating the roles of calcium, estrogen, and energy availability in treatment and recovery of low bone mineral density resulting from amenorrhea.

Reversing the Female Athlete Triad Portion of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport Syndrome






The athlete in this case study was an elite Caucasian female distance runner. She started running competitively at age 12 (before menarche) and competed until age 25. Her personal best at the 26.2 mi marathon distance was 2:41. She began restrictive eating at age 13 years. At times, her training volume was 90 mi·wk−1
. She exhibited primary amenorrhea until age 23, when she began calcium supplementation and estrogen replacement in the form of oral contraceptives. At that time her BMD (shown in the graph accompanying) was only 74% (T-score = −2.5) and 80% (T-score = −1.54) of normal peak for her spine and hip, respectively. Her body weight was 107 lb (48.6 kg), and her body mass index (BMI) (shown in the graph accompanying) was 15.8 kg·m−2
. Over the next 2 years, her body weight increased 4 lb (1.8 kg), and menarche occurred. However, not until she increased her energy availability by adopting better nutritional habits and decreasing her training mileage did she gain weight and increase her BMD (see graph). By age 31, she weighed a healthy 144 lb (BMI = 21.3 kg·m−2
), and her BMD values were almost in the normal range (spine = 94%; T-score = −0.63 and hip = 96%; T-score = −0.33). As the authors state, convincing competitive athletes to gain weight is sometimes a “formidable challenge.” Indeed, in this case, the individual was 25 years old before finally acting on the seriousness of her situation. It would, of course, have been better to avoid the disordered eating and resultant female athlete triad/RED-S in the first place.







The extent to which bone deficits can be reversed is unknown, especially in athletes with secondary amenorrhea. In the case presented here, the positive changes started to occur within 2 years of menarche. Hormone replacement (in conjunction with calcium intake) was insufficient to regain bone density. Improved nutrition, weight gain, and resumption of normal menstrual cycles were necessary for successful treatment.

Skeletal Injuries


Skeletal injuries can be categorized as resulting from macrotrauma or microtrauma (Micheli, 1989
). Macrotrauma injuries are sudden acute incidents, such as a broken leg or clavicle from impact or a fracture at the epiphyseal growth plate. Growth plate fractures have the greatest potential for harm. The probability of a growth plate injury is greatest in automobile accidents, falls, contact sports, and dynamic resistance training. Fractures of the growth plate can result in progressive bone shortening, deformity, or joint incongruity. Fortunately, acute traumatic growth plate injuries are less frequent than other injury types, and most such injuries appear not to result in growth disturbances (Caine, 1990
).



Microtrauma injuries are overuse injuries from chronic repetitive overtraining (

Micheli, 1989

). The anatomical site of microtrauma depends on the sport. Microtrauma injuries to bone generally involve an uncoupling or imbalance between bone resorption and bone

 deposition, called a stress reaction.
 Stress reactions
 refer to maladaptive areas of bone hyperactivity where resorption progressively exceeds deposition.




Early minor stress reactions may have no clinical manifestations. The individual feels no pain and has no swelling or tenderness. As the overuse continues and the imbalance becomes more extreme, several clinical symptoms may occur, including degeneration and loosening of portions of bone from the joint capsules, the formation of bone spurs, inflammation of bone and cartilage, and/or stress fractures. A
 stress fracture
 is a hairline break in bone that occurs without acute trauma, is clinically symptomatic, and is detectable by x-rays or bone scans. It is often difficult to determine exactly when a bone’s stress reaction becomes a stress fracture. The typical fine hairline fracture may be undetectable by x-rays or bone scans for 3–4 weeks after pain occurs.




Although exercise training can and does have a beneficial impact on bone growth and health, too much exercise training, usually in the form of repetitive overuse or rapid increments of intensity or duration, can be detrimental. Stress fractures are relatively common, accounting for 10% of all sports injuries requiring an appointment with a health care provider and responsible for approximately 30% of all running-related injuries. Stress fractures are most common in the tibial diaphysis, accounting for nearly 75% of all stress fractures (

Robertson and Wood, 2015

). Harm is more likely if the bone already has a low

 bone mineral density. The concern about overuse injuries therefore focuses on female athletes exhibiting the female athlete triad, males and females with disordered eating or low energy availability, and young growing athletes of both sexes (

Sterling et al., 1992

).

The concern for amenorrheic athletes is well founded. A higher prevalence of stress fractures has been documented in this population than in female athletes with normal menstrual cycles in a variety of sports (

Lloyd et al., 1986

;
 
Maffulli, 1990

;
 
Micheli, 1989

;
 
Myburgh et al., 1990

).




The exact incidence of microtrauma, including stress fractures, in youth athletes is difficult to document, although reports from orthopedists indicate that the number is growing as more children and adolescents participate in competitive sports (

Faulkner et al., 1993

). It has been reported that the highest incidence of stress fractures occurs between the ages of 10 and 15, at the time of peak growth (

Lloyd et al., 1986

;
 
Sterling et al., 1992

). Some researchers have suggested that a normal imbalance between bone matrix formation and mineralization occurs during the growth spurt. Furthermore, during this growth spurt, muscle imbalances can occur around joints as the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are stretched and become progressively tighter when the bones elongate. A muscle that is fatigued from overuse, is weak or out of balance with its antagonist, and/or is inflexible is less able to absorb shock, allowing abnormally high stress to be transmitted to the bone. This situation increases the risk of stress fractures, other repetitive stress reactions, and impact injuries (

Jones et al., 1989

;
 
Kibler et al., 1992

;
 
Maffulli, 1990

). The treatment of stress fractures relies on modifying activity and allowing the body to rest in order to halt progressive damage while the bone heals (

Wang et al., 2015

). The situation is more complex, of course, if the Reduced Energy Availability in Sport (RED-S) syndrome is the underlying causal factor.








CHECK YOUR COMPREHENSION 2
 CASE STUDY






Allison is a sophomore in college. She ran cross country in high school but did not participate on the team in her first year of college. The summer before her sophomore year she decided to improve her fitness so she could try out for the college cross country team. About 3 weeks into her training program, she began to experience pain in her shins when she running. What is the most likely cause of this pain? What should she do about it?







Check your answer in Appendix C.








Complete the Check Your Comprehension 2 Case Study.

 The primary individual risk factor for overuse injuries is training error, particularly abrupt increases in intensity, duration, and frequency (

Micheli, 1989

). Workload should not increase more than 10% per week in young training athletes. Other non–RED-S risk factors include the aforementioned musculoskeletal imbalances of strength, flexibility, or size; errors in technique or skills; anatomical malalignments; footwear that fits improperly; and running on hard surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. Parents and others involved in youth sports must give careful attention to these factors. For example, during periods of rapid growth, the intensity of training should be reduced and static stretching programs emphasized.




Although the skeletal system is often taken for granted, it should not be. When it is injured or malfunctioning, we quickly become aware of its importance. Adequate nutrition, reasonable training regimens, and maintenance of normal hormonal levels are keys to good bone health for both sexes and all ages.





SUMMARY





1.
 The skeletal system serves a number of important functions, including support, protection, movement, mineral storage, and hematopoiesis (blood cell formation).




2.
 Bone tissue is dynamic, living tissue that is constantly undergoing change. Bone remodeling is a continual process of bone resorption and formation of new bone.




3.
 Osteoclasts are bone cells that cause the resorption (breakdown) of bone tissue. Osteoblasts are bone-forming cells. Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts surrounded by calcified bone.




4.
 The two major types of bone tissue are cortical and trabecular bone; they differ in their microscopic appearance.




5.
 Studies generally show that physical activity has a positive effect on bone health. Exercise training can enhance the attainment of peak bone mass during late adolescence and early adulthood, can slow the rate of age-related bone loss in later adulthood, and may offset menopausal-related bone loss.




6.
 Weight-bearing and impact-loading activities lead to an acute osteogenic effect in bone.




7.
 The mechanostat theory of bone response posits that a minimal effect strain is necessary to elicit normal remodeling of bone tissue and that a higher threshold exists for the enhancement of bone strength. This is consistent with the overload principle of training.




8.
 Weight-bearing or impact-loading activities produce greater changes in bone mineral density than do non–weight-bearing or weight-supported activities.




9.
 An appropriate exercise prescription for skeletal health should take into account the individual’s current skeletal health. On the basis of current status and individual desires, activities should be chosen from a continuum of impact-loading activities.




10.
 Osteoporosis means “porous bones,” a condition characterized by a loss of bone mineral density, resulting in bones that are weak and susceptible to fracture. It is clinically defined as a bone mineral density greater than −2.5 standard deviations below young, normal adult averages.




11.
 The female athlete triad is a portion of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport syndrome (RED-S). The underlying factor responsible for the female athlete triad is low energy availability resulting from disordered eating (DE) or a diagnosed eating disorder (ED). The two linked health consequences are menstrual dysfunction, and skeletal demineralization. Low energy availability is directly linked to menstrual dysfunction through low estrogen levels and to skeletal demineralization by affecting metabolic substrates and hormones.
