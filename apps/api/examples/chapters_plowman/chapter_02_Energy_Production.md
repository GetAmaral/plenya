OBJECTIVES




After studying the chapter, you should be able to:






Describe the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).






Summarize the processes of cellular respiration for the production of ATP from carbohydrate, fat, and protein fuel substrates.






Calculate the number of ATP produced from glucose or glycogen, fatty acid, and amino acid precursors.






Describe the goals of metabolic regulation during exercise.






Explain how the production of energy is regulated by intracellular and extracellular factors.






Compare the relative use of carbohydrate, fat, and protein fuel substrates based on the intensity and duration of exercise.








Introduction




Most individuals eat at least three meals a day. Eating is necessary to provide the energy that is essential for all cellular—and thus bodily—activity. To provide this energy, food must be transformed into chemical energy.



The total of all energy transformations that occur in the body is called
 metabolism
. When energy is used to build tissues—as when amino acids are combined to form proteins that make up muscle—the process is called
 anabolism
. When energy is produced from the breakdown of foodstuffs and stored so that it is available to do work, the process is called
 catabolism
.




It is catabolism that is of primary importance in exercise metabolism. Energy is needed to support muscle activity, whether a little or a lot of muscle mass is involved or the exercise is light or heavy, submaximal or maximal. In providing this needed energy, the human body is subject to the
 First Law of Thermodynamics
, which states that energy is neither created nor destroyed but only changed in form.
 
Figure 2.1

 depicts this law and the changes in form representing catabolism. Potential chemical energy—or fuel—is ingested as food. Carbohydrates, fats, and protein can all be used as fuels, although they are not used equally by the body in that capacity. The chemical energy produced from the food fuel is stored as
 adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
. The ATP then transfers its energy to energy-requiring physiological functions, such as muscle contraction during exercise, in which some energy performs the work and some is converted into heat. Thus, ATP is stored chemical energy that links the energy-yielding and the energy-requiring functions within all cells. The aim of this chapter is to fully explain ATP and how it is produced from carbohydrate, fat, and protein food sources.

 Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy exists in six forms: chemical, mechanical, heat, light, electrical, and nuclear. Movement of the human body (work) represents mechanical energy that is supported by the chemical energy derived from food fuels. See animation, Catabolism, at http://thepoint.lww.com/







Adenosine Triphosphate




Structurally, ATP is composed of a carbon-nitrogen base called adenine, a five-carbon sugar called ribose, and three phosphates, symbolized by Pi
 (inorganic phosphate). Each phosphate group is linked by a chemical bond. When one phosphate is removed, the remaining compound is adenosine diphosphate (ADP). When two phosphates are removed, the remaining compound is adenosine monophosphate (AMP).



The ATP energy reaction is reversible. When ATP is synthesized from ADP and P
i
, energy is required. The addition of P
i
 is known as
 phosphorylation
.








When ATP is broken down, energy is released.
 Hydrolysis
 is a chemical process in which a substance is split into simpler compounds by the addition of water. ATP is split by hydrolysis.








The energy-requiring and energy-releasing reactions involving ATP are
 coupled reactions
. Coupled reactions are linked chemical processes in which a change in one substance is accompanied by a change in another; that is, one of these reactions does not occur without the other. As the chemical agent that links the energy-yielding and energy-requiring functions in the cell, ATP is also a universal agent. It is the immediate source of energy for virtually all reactions requiring energy in all cells.

ATP is often referred to as cellular energy. Actually, ATP is a high-energy molecule. The term high energy means that the probability is high that when a phosphate is removed, energy will be transferred (

Brooks et al., 2004

). To better understand how the breakdown of ATP releases energy, consider the analogy of a spring-loaded dart gun. The dart can be considered analogous to P
i
. It takes energy to “spring-load” the dart; this energy corresponds to the energy involved in the energy-requiring reaction:








Once the dart is loaded, the compressed spring has potential energy, which is released when the gun is fired. Firing corresponds to the energy-releasing reaction:







The ATP content of skeletal muscle at rest is about 6 mmol·kg−1
. If not replenished, this amount could supply energy for only about 3 seconds of maximal contraction. The total amount of ATP stored in the body at any given time is approximately 0.1 kg, which is enough energy for only a few minutes of physiological function. However, ATP is constantly being hydrolyzed and resynthesized. The average adult produces and breaks down (turns over) approximately 40 kg (88 lb) of ATP daily, and an athlete may turn over 70 kg (154 lb) a day. The rate of hydrolysis of ATP during maximal exercise may be as high as 0.5·kg min−1
 (Mougios, 2006
).



ATP can be resynthesized from ADP in three ways:




1.
 By interaction of ADP with PC (phosphocreatine, which is sometimes designated as CP, or creatine phosphate)




2.
 By anaerobic respiration in the cell cytoplasm




3.
 By aerobic respiration in the cell mitochondria




Phosphocreatine
 is another high-energy compound stored in muscles. It transfers its phosphate—and, thus, its potential energy—to ADP to form ATP, leaving creatine:








Resting muscle contains more PC (~20 mmol·kg
−1
) and C (~12 mmol·kg
−1
) than ATP. The maximal rate of ATP resynthesis from PC is approximately 2.6 mmol·kg
–1
·sec
−1
 and occurs within 1–2 seconds of the onset of maximal contraction. PC stores are used to regenerate ATP and in a working muscle will be depleted in 15–30 seconds. The rest of this chapter will concentrate on the more substantial production of ATP by the second and third techniques listed, namely, anaerobic and aerobic cellular respiration.





Cellular Respiration




The process by which cells transfer energy from food to ATP in a stepwise series of reactions is called cellular respiration
. This term is used because, to produce energy, the cells rely heavily on the oxygen that the respiratory system provides. In addition, the by-product of energy production, carbon dioxide, is exhaled through the respiratory system. Cellular respiration can be either anaerobic or aerobic. Anaerobic
 respiration means it occurs in the absence of oxygen, does not require oxygen, or does not use oxygen. Aerobic
 means it occurs in the presence of oxygen, requires oxygen, or uses oxygen. Brain cells cannot produce energy anaerobically, and cardiac muscle cells have only a minimal capacity for anaerobic energy production. Skeletal muscle cells, however, can produce energy aerobically and/or anaerobically as the situation demands.




Figure 2.2

 outlines the products and processes of cellular respiration, which are discussed in detail in the following sections. Following are some basic points about these processes:










FIGURE 2.2
 An Overview of Cellular Respiration.
 *Glycerol can enter glycolysis in liver or fat cells but not in muscle cells. †Blue boxes represent the process; green boxes represent metabolic intermediates; arrows
 show the direction of flow.





1.
 All three major food nutrients, fats (FAT), carbohydrates (CHO), and proteins (PRO), can serve as fuel or
 substrates
—the substances acted upon by enzymes—for the production of ATP.




2.
 The most important immediate forms of the substrates utilized are glucose (GLU), free fatty acids (FFA), and amino acids (AA). Both FFA and glycerol are derived from the breakdown of triglycerides. Some cells can use glycerol directly in glycolysis, but muscle cells cannot.




3.
 Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) is the central converting substance (usually called the universal or
 common intermediate
) in the metabolism of FAT, CHO, and PRO. Although the process of glycolysis provides a small amount of ATP as well as acetyl CoA, both beta-oxidation and oxidative deamination or transamination are simply preparatory steps by which FFA and AA are converted to acetyl CoA. That is, beta-oxidation and oxidative deamination or transamination are simply processes for converting FFA and AA, respectively, to a common substrate that allows the metabolic pathway to continue. The end result is that the primary metabolic pathways of the Krebs cycle, electron transport system (ETS), and oxidative phosphorylation (OP) are the same regardless of the type of food precursor. This is certainly more efficient than having totally different pathways for each food nutrient.




4.
 Each of the energy-producing processes or stages (glycolysis, formation of acetyl CoA, Krebs cycle, ETS/OP) consists of a series of steps. Each step represents a small chemical change to a substrate, resulting in a slightly different product in a precise, unvarying sequence with a designed first and last step. This is known as a
 metabolic pathway
. That is, a metabolic pathway is a sequence of enzyme-mediated chemical reactions resulting in a specific product. Each stage may be made up of one or more metabolic pathways. These sequences of steps are important for the body because they allow energy to be released gradually. If all of the energy contained in food nutrients were released at one time, it would be predominantly released as heat and would destroy tissue.






Cellular Respiration
 The process by which cells transfer energy from food to ATP in a stepwise series of reactions. It relies heavily on the use of oxygen.

It is easy to be intimidated by or uninterested in so many steps, each with its own chemical structure,

 enzyme, and long, complicated name. There is a logic to these steps, however. It is on this logic and understanding (rather than the chemical structures) that the following discussion concentrates.





Carbohydrate Metabolism




The discussion of ATP production begins with carbohydrate metabolism for several reasons. First, many of the energy requirements of the human body are met by carbohydrate metabolism. Second, carbohydrate is the only food nutrient that can be used to produce energy anaerobically. Energy for both rest and exercise is provided primarily by aerobic metabolism. However, exercise often requires anaerobic energy production, and then carbohydrate is essential. Third, carbohydrate is the preferred fuel of the body because carbohydrate requires less oxygen in order to be metabolized than does fat. Finally, once you understand carbohydrate metabolism, it is relatively simple to understand how fats and proteins are metabolized.



Carbohydrates are composed of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H). The complete metabolism of carbohydrate requires oxygen, which is supplied by the respiratory system and is transported by the circulatory systems to the muscle cells. The metabolism of carbohydrate also produces carbon dioxide (CO
2
), which is removed via the circulatory and respiratory systems, and water.




The form of carbohydrate that is exclusively metabolized is glucose, a six-carbon sugar arranged in a hexagonal formation and symbolized as C
6
H
12
O
6
. Thus, all carbohydrates must be broken down into glucose in order to continue through the metabolic pathways. In its most simplistic form, the oxidation of glucose can be represented by the equation







or







In the skeletal muscle, cell oxidation is tightly coupled with phosphorylation to produce energy in the form of ATP. Therefore, the equation becomes







or







When excess glucose is available to the cell, it can be stored as
 glycogen
, which is a chain of glucose molecules chemically linked together, or it can be converted to and

 stored as fat. The formation of glycogen from glucose is called
 glycogenesis
. Glycogen is stored predominantly in the liver and muscle cells, as shown in the electron micrograph in
 
Figure 2.3

. When additional glucose is needed, stored glycogen is broken down (hydrolyzed) to provide glucose, through a process called
 glycogenolysis
. Because glycogen must first be broken down into glucose, the production of energy from glucose or glycogen is identical after that initial step. The complete breakdown of glucose and glycogen follows the four-stage process outlined in
 
Figure 2.4

 and detailed in later figures.

FIGURE 2.4
 The Four Stages of Carbohydrate Cellular Respiration.





Stage I: Glycolysis Overview


Glycolysis is important in part because it prepares glucose to enter the next stage of metabolism (see Figure 2.4
) by converting glucose to pyruvate. Also very important is the fact that ATP is produced directly during glycolysis. This process is the only way ATP is produced in the absence of oxygen (anaerobically).



Glycolysis
 literally means the breakdown or dissolution of sugar. It is the energy pathway responsible for the initial catabolism of glucose in a 10- or 11-step process. Glycolysis begins with either glucose or glycogen and ends with the production of either pyruvate (pyruvic acid) by aerobic glycolysis or lactate (lactic acid) by anaerobic glycolysis (

Frisell, 1982

;
 
Lehninger, 1971

;
 
Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

;
 
Mougios, 2006

;
 
Newsholme and Leech, 1983

). (Note that names ending in
 -ate
 technically indicate the salts of their respective acids; that is lactate is the salt of lactic acid. However, the salt and acid forms are often used interchangeably in descriptions of the metabolic pathways.)




Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. An
 enzyme
 is a protein that accelerates the speed of a chemical reaction without itself being changed by the reaction. It does not cause a reaction that would not otherwise occur; it simply speeds up one that would occur anyway. Metabolic enzymes are easy to identify because their names usually end in the suffix
 -ase
. Generally, their names are also related to the substrate or type of reaction (or both) they are catalyzing. For those reactions that are reversible,

 a specific single enzyme will catalyze the reaction in both directions.






Glycogen
 Stored form of carbohydrate composed of chains of glucose molecules chemically linked together.



Glycogenolysis
 The process by which stored glycogen is broken down (hydrolyzed) to provide glucose.



Glycolysis
 The energy pathway responsible for the initial catabolism of glucose in a 10- or 11-step process that begins with glucose or glycogen and ends with the production of pyruvate (aerobic glycolysis) or lactate (anaerobic glycolysis).



Enzyme
 A protein that accelerates the speed of a chemical reaction without itself being changed by the reaction.





The activity of enzymes is affected by the concentrations of the substrate acted upon and of the enzyme itself, temperature, pH, and the presence or absence of other ions, poisons, or medications. The following discussions describe how enzymes act in a normal physiological environment. Only a few selected enzymes that are especially important or function in regulatory or rate-limiting roles are described here.
 Regulatory or rate-limiting enzymes
 are the enzymes that are critical in controlling the rate and direction of energy production along a metabolic pathway—just as a traffic light regulates the flow of vehicles along a road.




As a metabolic pathway, glycolysis begins with the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream from the small intestine or with the release of glucose into the bloodstream from the liver. Either step supplies the fuel. Glucose is then transported into the muscle cell. Transport occurs across the cell membrane via facilitated diffusion, utilizing a protein carrier and occurring down a concentration gradient. The carriers are called
 glucose transporter carrier proteins, or GLUT
, and are differentiated by numbers, from 1 to 12 with a 13th labeled as HMIT (

Wilson-O’Brien et al., 2010

;
 
Zhao and Keating, 2007

). Transport is a passive process that does not require the expenditure of energy.




The predominant transporters of glucose in human skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose cells are GLUT-1 (non–insulin regulated) and GLUT-4 (insulin regulated) (

Figure 2.5

). GLUT-1 transporters are located in the sarcolemma or cell membrane. In resting muscles when blood glucose levels are relatively stable, most glucose enters by GLUT-1 transport. When glucose and insulin levels are high, such as after a meal, or when insulin levels are low, such as during exercise, most glucose enters by GLUT-4 transport. The GLUT-4 transporters are thus activated both by insulin, through a second messenger system, and by muscle contraction. Calcium (Ca
2+
) is probably one of the second messengers (

Brooks et al., 2004

;
 
MacLean et al., 2000

;
 
Wilson-O’Brien et al., 2010

;
 
Zhao and Keating, 2007

). Within skeletal muscle, the number of GLUT-4 transporters is highest in fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG, Type IIA) fibers, followed by slow-twitch oxidative (SO, Type I) fibers, and is lowest in fast-twitch glycolytic (FG, Type IIX fibers (

Sato et al., 1996

).










FIGURE 2.5
 Glucose Transport into Muscle Cells.
 In the resting muscle, when blood glucose levels are relatively stable, glucose enters by the non–insulin-regulated GLUT-1 transporters. Following a meal, insulin interacts with its receptors, and second messengers stimulate GLUT-4 to translocate from their storage vesicles to the sarcolemma and glucose is transported into the cell. During exercise and early recovery, muscle contraction involves Ca2+
 release that stimulates the translocation of GLUT-4.







FOCUS ON APPLICATION:
 Clinically Relevant





Diabetes






As described in the text and shown in Figure 2.5
, for glucose to enter muscle cells and be used as fuel, insulin and GLUT-4 translocation or muscle contraction and GLUT-4 translocation are required. Malfunction of this process can result in diabetes mellitus.







Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease that involves the destruction of the beta cells (β-cells) in the pancreas that normally secrete insulin. This leads to a deficiency of insulin, glucose intolerance (the inability to use carbohydrate effectively), and increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia).








Type II diabetes is characterized by a progression of steps indicating impaired regulation of glucose metabolism. The initial step is insulin resistance (the inability to achieve normal rates of glucose uptake in response to insulin). Insulin resistance is indicated by glucose intolerance, sometimes called impaired fasting glucose (IFG). IFG may be diagnosed in an individual more than 10 years before the disease fully develops. In response to insulin resistance, the β-cells increase insulin secretion (hyperinsulinemia), which may compensate for the insulin resistance for a while. However, at some point, the β-cells will fail and hyperglycemia occurs. This signals that the clinical development of the disease, but not the consequences, is complete.








Research evidence indicates that the initial step of insulin resistance is due to dysfunction in the GLUT-4 translocator process. That is, insulin resistance results from a reduced ability to stimulate GLUT-4 cells to migrate to the cell surface. Precisely what in the insulin-signaling pathway is defective is unknown. The number of both GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 transporters is similar in those with and without type II diabetes.








Although there is a genetic component to type II diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity are strongly related to the expression of this predisposition. Conversely, exercise training increases GLUT-4 function in skeletal muscle that, in turn, improves insulin action on glucose metabolism and can be important in the prevention of, or delay in, the development of type II diabetes.

GLUT-4 transporters exist intracellularly in small sacs or vesicles within the cytoplasm. When activated, they literally move to the cell surface (translocate) and serve as portals through which glucose enters the cell. The maximal rate of muscle glucose transport is determined by both the total number of GLUT-4 molecules and the proportion that are translocated to the cell membrane (

Houston, 1995

;
 
Sato et al., 1996

). The dual stimulation of GLUT-4 translocation by insulin and contraction is important because insulin secretion is suppressed during exercise. Thus, during exercise, the predominant activator of GLUT-4 transporters is the muscle contraction itself. When total work performed is equal, GLUT-4 increases are similar despite differences in exercise intensity and duration (

Kraniou et al., 2006

). The effect of muscle contraction persists into the early recovery period to help rebuild depleted glycogen stores (

Houston, 1995

).




Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. The enzymes that catalyze each step float free in the cytoplasm. The substances acted upon by the enzymes and the resultant products are transferred by diffusion, which is the tendency

 of molecules to move from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration. All of the intermediates (everything but glucose and the pyruvate or lactate) are phosphorylated compounds—that is, they contain phosphates. All of the phosphate intermediates, ADP, and ATP are unable to pass through the cell membrane. The cell membrane, however, is freely permeable to glucose and lactate.




Glycolysis, as depicted in
 
Figure 2.6

, involves both the utilization and production of ATP. One ATP molecule is used in the first step if the initial fuel is glucose, but not if the initial fuel is glycogen. One ATP is used in step 3 regardless of whether the initial fuel is glucose or glycogen. Thus, 1 ATP is used for activation if the initial fuel is glycogen, but 2 ATP are used if the initial fuel is glucose. ATP is produced from ADP + P
i
 at steps 7 and 10 by a process known as substrate-level phosphorylation.
 Substrate-level phosphorylation
 is the transfer of P
i
 directly from the phosphorylated intermediates or substrates to ADP without any oxidation occurring. A net total of 3 ATP is gained if glycogen is the initial fuel, but only 2 ATP are gained if glucose is the initial fuel.

Oxidation
 A gain of oxygen, a loss of hydrogen, or the direct loss of electrons by an atom or substance.



Reduction
 A loss of oxygen, a gain of electrons, or a gain of hydrogen by an atom or substance.



Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD)
 A hydrogen carrier in cellular respiration.



Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)
 A hydrogen carrier in cellular respiration.



Mitochondria
 Cell organelles in which the formation of acetyl CoA, Krebs cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation take place.





Exactly how glycolysis is accomplished is explained in the following step-by-step analysis. First, however, one should understand the processes of oxidation and reduction and the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).



OXIDATION-REDUCTION There are three kinds of oxidation
: a gain of oxygen (hence the name), a loss of hydrogen, or the direct loss of electrons by an atom or substance.



The process whereby an atom or substance gains electrons is called
 reduction
. The electron’s negative charge reduces the molecule’s overall charge. A good way to remember that electrons are gained through reduction, not oxidation, is to associate the “e” in reduction with the “e” in electron: reduction = +e
−
. Reduction can also mean a loss of oxygen or a gain of hydrogen by an atom or a substance. Electron donors are known as reducing

 agents, and electron acceptors as oxidizing agents. The major electron donors are organic fuels, such as glucose. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor or oxidizing agent in cellular respiration.




When one substance is oxidized, another is simultaneously reduced. The substance that is oxidized also loses energy; the substance that is reduced also gains energy.




Oxidation in the form of hydrogen removal occurs in several of the intermediary steps in cellular respiration. When hydrogen atoms are removed, they must be transported elsewhere. The two most important hydrogen carriers in cellular respiration are
 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
 and
 flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
. Both NAD and FAD can accept two electrons and two protons from two hydrogen atoms. Each does so in a slightly different manner, however. FAD (the oxidized form is FAD
ox
) actually binds both protons and is written as FADH
2
 (or FAD reduced, written FAD
red
). NAD actually exists as NAD
+
 (or NAD oxidized, written NAD
ox
); when bonded to hydrogen, it is written as NADH + H
+
 (or NAD reduced, written as NAD
red
). The symbols NAD
+
 and FAD will be used to indicate the oxidized form in this text, and NADH + H
+
 and FADH
2
 will be used to indicate the reduced form of these carriers, so that it is clear where the hydrogen atoms are. NAD
+
 is by far the more important hydrogen carrier in human metabolism.




A helpful analogy of the roles of FAD and NAD is a taxicab. The purpose of NAD and FAD is to transport (serve as taxis for) the hydrogen. NAD and FAD must pick up hydrogen passengers (be reduced) and they must drop them off (be oxidized) at another point without either the carrier (taxi) or the hydrogen (passengers) being permanently changed.



THE STEPS OF STAGE I Refer to Figure 2.6
 as each step is explained in the text (Frisell, 1982
; Lehninger, 1971
; Mougios, 2006
; Newsholme and Leech, 1983
; Salway, 1994
).



Step 1
. The glucose molecule, which has six carbons indicated by the (6C), is phosphorylated (has a phosphate attached) through the transfer of one phosphate group from ATP to the location of the sixth carbon on the glucose hexagon, producing glucose-6-phosphate. Hexokinase is the enzyme that catalyzes this process. This phosphorylation effectively traps the glucose in that particular cell, because the electrical charge of the phosphate group prohibits glucose from crossing the membrane, and the enzyme that can break this phosphate bond is not present in muscle cells.




The same is true for the glycogen in the cells; that is, it is trapped in the muscle where it is stored. On the other hand, the liver has enzymes to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream.




These facts are important because during high-intensity, long-term exercise, glycogen stored in specific muscles must be used there. Furthermore, glycogen that is stored in muscles but not used in an activity (e.g., the upper body during a running event) cannot be transported from the inactive muscles to the active ones. Therefore, high levels of glycogen need to be stored in the muscles that will be used.




Step 2
. The atoms that make up the glucose-6-phosphate are simply rearranged to form fructose-6-phosphate.




Step 3
. Another molecule of ATP is broken down and the phosphate added at the first carbon. This addition places a phosphate group at each end of the molecule and results in the product fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The prefixes
 di
- and
 bis
- both mean “two,” but
 di-
 indicates two groups attached to the same spot and
 bis-
 at different positions. Two phosphates are now part of the molecule. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis.




Step 4
. This is the step from which glycolysis, meaning sugar breaking or splitting, gets its name, for here the 6-carbon sugar is split into two 3-carbon sugars indicated by the (3C). The two sugars are identical in terms of their component atoms but have different names (dihydroxyacetone phosphate, or DHAP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, or G3P) because the component atoms are arranged differently.




Step 5
. The atoms of dihydroxyacetone phosphate are rearranged to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, with the phosphate group at the third carbon. From this point on, each step occurs twice (indicated by 2× in
 
Figure 2.6

), once for each of the three carbon subunits.




Step 6
. Two reactions that are coupled occur in this step. In the first, a pair of hydrogen atoms is transferred from the G3P to the hydrogen carrier NAD
+
, reducing this to NADH + H
+
. The fate of this NADH + H
+
 will be dealt with later. This reaction releases enough energy to perform the second reaction, which adds a phosphate from the P
i
 always present in the cytoplasm to the first carbon, so that the product becomes 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.




Step 7
. ATP is finally produced from ADP in this step when the phosphate from the first carbon is transferred to ADP, storing energy. Since this step is also doubled, two ATP molecules are formed. The resulting intermediate is called 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG).




Step 8
. This is simply another rearrangement step where the phosphate is moved from the number 3 to the number 2 carbon and the name becomes 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG).




Step 9
. A water molecule is removed, which weakens the bond between the remaining phosphate group and the rest of the atoms forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).




Step 10
. The remaining phosphate is transferred from PEP to ADP, forming ATP and pyruvate. The enzyme that catalyzes this step is pyruvate kinase. Again, since the reaction happens twice, two ATP molecules are produced

.




Step 11
. If the hydrogen atoms carried by NADH + H
+
 are unable to enter the electron transport chain (as described in Stage IV), they are transferred instead to pyruvate (pyruvic acid), forming lactate (lactic acid), which regenerates the NAD
+
. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is lactic dehydrogenase.




The formula for pyruvate is C
3
H
3
O
3
 whereas the formula for lactate is C
3
H
5
O
3
. The formula for pyruvic acid is C
3
H
4
O
3
 and the formula for lactic acid is C
3
H
6
O
3
. Both the number of carbon atoms and the number of oxygen atoms are the same; however, there are four fewer hydrogen atoms in two molecules of pyruvate/pyruvic acid than lactate/lactic acid. These are the hydrogen atoms that are carried by the NAD
+
 from step 6 and used to produce the lactate (2C
3
H
5
O
3
)/lactic acid (2C
3
H
6
O
3
) from pyruvate/pyruvic acid. If lactate/lactic acid is not formed, the hydrogen atoms from step 6 may be carried further down the metabolic chain. Currently, there is some unresolved controversy as to whether skeletal muscle actually produces lactate or lactic acid. What has just been presented represents the accepted classic view and the interchangeable use of the salt and acid forms in the metabolic pathways and discussions will be maintained throughout this textbook (

Brooks, 2010

;
 
Marcinek et al., 2010

;
 
Robergs et al., 2004

)

.




When the end product of glycolysis is pyruvate/pyruvic acid, the process is called
 aerobic glycolysis
 (or
 slow glycolysis
). When the end product of glycolysis is lactate/lactic acid, the process is called
 anaerobic glycolysis
 (or
 fast glycolysis
). Glucose predominates as the fuel for slow glycolysis, and glycogen predominates as the fuel for fast glycolysis.



MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria
 (the plural form of the singular mitochondrion) are subcellular organelles that are often called the powerhouses of the cell. The formation of acetyl CoA, Krebs cycle, electron transport, and Oxidative phosphorylation (OP) all take place in the mitochondria.




Figure 2.7

 presents a diagram and an electron micrograph of a mitochondrion: a three-dimensional, discretely encapsulated, bean-shaped structure. In actual living tissue, mitochondria exist in many different shapes—and, indeed, they constantly change shapes.

As shown in
 
Figure 2.7

, mitochondria have seven distinct components. The first component is the outer membrane (labeled 1 in the figure). As is usual, this membrane serves as a barrier; however, it contains many channels through which solutes can pass and so is permeable to many ions and molecules. The second component (2) is an inner membrane. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to most ions and molecules unless each has a specific carrier. It is, however, permeable to water and oxygen. The inner membrane is parallel to the outer membrane in spots, but it also consists of a series of folds or convolutions called crista (3) (the plural is cristae). Extending through and protruding from the inner membrane are a series of protein-enzyme complexes called ball-and-stalk ATP synthase complexes (4) that look like a golf ball on a tee. Although the inner membrane has transport functions, the crista portion and especially the ball-and-stalk apparatus are specialized as the locations where ATP synthesis actually takes place.




The area between the two membranes is known simply as the intermembrane space (5). The center portion of the mitochondria is known as the matrix (6). The matrix is filled with a gel-like substance composed of water and proteins. Metabolic enzymes and DNA (7) for organelle replication are stored here.




The fact that mitochondria contain their own DNA means that they are self-replicating. When a need for more ATP arises, mitochondria simply split in half and then grow to their former size. This property, discussed later, has specific implications for how an individual adapts to exercise training. It also explains why some cells have only a few mitochondria but others have thousands. Red blood cells are unique in that they contain no mitochondria.




Mitochondria tend to be located where they are needed. Within muscle cells, they lie directly beneath the cell membrane (called sarcolemmal or subsarcolemmal mitochondria) and among the contractile elements (called interfibrillar mitochondria).



Stage II: Formation of Acetyl Coenzyme A


Stage II (Figure 2.8
) is a very short metabolic pathway consisting solely of the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. No ATP is either used or produced directly. However, a pair of hydrogen atoms (because all reactions still happen twice) are removed and picked up by NAD+
 to be transferred to the electron transport chain.









FIGURE 2.8
 Stage II: The Formation of Acetyl Coenzyme A.






The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA takes place within the mitochondrial matrix (

Figure 2.7

). This conversion requires that the pyruvate be transported across

 the mitochondrial membranes via a specific carrier. No oxygen is used directly in this stage, but these steps occur only in the presence of oxygen. As usual, enzymes catalyze each reaction.



THE STEPS OF STAGE II Refer to the diagram in Figure 2.8
 for the two steps of Stage II (Frisell, 1982
; Lehninger, 1971
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
; Mougios, 2006
; Newsholme and Leech, 1983
; Salway, 1994
).



Step 1.
 Pyruvate is converted to acetic acid. In the process, one molecule of CO
2
 is removed. This CO
2
, as well as the CO
2
 that will be formed in Stage III, diffuses into the bloodstream and is ultimately exhaled via the lungs.




Step 2.
 Acetic acid is combined with coenzyme A to form acetyl CoA. A
 coenzyme
 is a nonprotein substance derived from a vitamin that activates an enzyme. The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA commits the pyruvate to Stages III and IV since there is no biochemical means of reconverting acetyl CoA back to pyruvate.



Stage III: Krebs Cycle


The Krebs cycle
 is a cycle because it begins and ends with the same substance, called oxaloacetate (or oxaloacetic acid, abbreviated as OAA). The cycle is an eight-step process (see Figure 2.9
) that actually constitutes two metabolic pathways: one pathway for steps 1–3 and the second pathway for steps 4–8.









FIGURE 2.9
 Stage III: The Krebs Cycle.








Coenzyme
 A nonprotein substance derived from a vitamin that activates an enzyme.



Krebs Cycle
 A series of eight chemical reactions that begins and ends with the same substance; energy is liberated for direct substrate phosphorylation of ATP from ADP, and Pi carbon dioxide is formed and hydrogen atoms removed and carried by NAD+ and FAD to the electron transport system; does not directly utilize oxygen but requires its presence.





No ATP is used in the Krebs cycle, and only one step (5) results in the substrate-level phosphorylation production of ATP. However, four steps (3, 4, 6, and 8) result in the removal of hydrogen atoms, which are picked up by either NAD
+
 or FAD. This result is critically important, because these are the hydrogen atoms that will provide the electrons for the electron transport system. Carbon dioxide is produced at steps 3 and 4. As with every step since the 6-carbon glucose molecule was split into two 3-carbon units in Stage I (step 4,
 
Figure 2.6

), every reaction and product is doubled.




All of the enzymes and hence all of the reactions for the Krebs cycle occur within the mitochondrial matrix, with one exception. The enzyme succinate dehydrogenase that catalyzes step 6 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.




The intermediate molecules as well as the preliminary molecules, pyruvic acid and acetyl CoA, are keto acids. Although no oxygen is used directly, this stage requires the presence of oxygen.



THE STEPS OF STAGE III The steps for the Krebs cycle (Frisell, 1982
; Lehninger, 1971
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
; Mougios, 2006
; Newsholme and Leech, 1983
; Salway, 1994
) are presented in Figure 2.9
, which you should refer to while reading the discussion.



Step 1
. The 2-carbon acetyl CoA combines with the 4-carbon molecule oxaloacetate (OAA) to form citrate or citric acid. This cycle is thus also known as the citric acid cycle. In the reaction, the coenzyme A (CoA-SH) is removed from acetyl CoA and is free to convert more pyruvate to acetyl CoA or to be used later in the cycle.




Step 2
. The atoms of citric acid (citrate) are rearranged to become isocitrate. This rearrangement sometimes involves an intermediary substrate, cis-aconitate, being produced between citrate and isocitrate (shown in parenthesis is
 
Figure 2.9

). However, this step is not obligatory, and a single enzyme, aconitase, catalyzes both reactions (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

).




Step 3
. Two reactions occur. In the first, hydrogen atoms are removed and accepted by the carrier NAD
+
, forming NADH + H
+
. In the second reaction, a CO
2
 is removed, leaving the 5-carbon α-ketoglutarate.




Step 4
. Step 4 is basically a repetition of step 3 in that a pair of hydrogen atoms are removed and picked up by NAD
+
 and a CO
2
 is also removed. In addition, the remaining structure is attached to coenzyme A (CoA-SH). The resultant succinyl CoA has four carbons, which will remain intact throughout the rest of the cycle.




Step 5
. In this step, coenzyme A is displaced by a phosphate group, which in turn is transferred to a substance called guanosine diphosphate (GDP), resulting in guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP is equivalent to

 ATP in terms of energy and is labeled and counted as ATP in this book. This is the only step in the Krebs cycle that produces and stores energy directly. As in glycolysis, this ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation. The resulting intermediate is succinate.




Step 6
. More hydrogen atoms are removed, but this time the carrier substance is FAD, forming FADH
2
. Fumarate is formed.




Step 7
. Water is added, converting fumarate to malate.




Step 8
. A pair of hydrogen atoms is removed and accepted by NAD
+
. The remaining atoms once more make up oxaloacetate, and the cycle is ready to begin again.




The ATP produced in Stages I and III can be used immediately to provide energy for the cell. The CO
2
 produced in Stage II diffuses into the bloodstream, is transported to the lungs, and is exhaled. Now, we will describe what happens to all of the hydrogen atoms that are carried as NADH + H
+
 and FADH
2
.



Stage IV: Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation


The electron transport system (ETS)
 or respiratory chain is the final metabolic pathway in the production of ATP. It proceeds as a series of chemical reactions in the mitochondria that transfer electrons from the hydrogen atom carriers NAD+
 and FAD to oxygen. Water is formed as a by-product, and the electrochemical energy released by the hydrogen ions is coupled to the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi
. The chain itself consists of a series of electron (e−
) carriers and proton pumps embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Most carriers are proteins or proteins combined with metal ions (such as iron, Fe) that attract e−
. The major carriers are indicated in Figure 2.10
. Four of these carriers are stationary: Complexes I, II, III, and IV. Three (I, III, and IV) are embedded into the inner membrane of the mitochondria, while Complex II is attached to the inner membrane on the matrix side. Cytochromes b
 and c
1
 are part of Complex III, and cytochromes a
 and a
3
 are part of Complex IV. Coenzyme Q and cytochrome c
 are mobile and diffuse through the inner membrane carrying electrons. Coenzyme Q moves from Complexes I and II to Complex III, and cytochrome c
 moves from Complex III to IV.









FIGURE 2.10
 Stage IV: Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation.
 The numbered steps are indicated in the solid boxes
.





The H
+
 and e
−
 come from the breakdown of the hydrogen atoms released in Stages I, II, and III and transported to the electron transport chain by NAD
+
 and FAD:








The H
+
 are deposited first into the mitochondrial matrix and then move via the proton pumps into the intermembrane space. The e
−
 are shuttled along from

 one electron acceptor to the next (see
 
Figure 2.10

). The e
−
 move along in a series of oxidation-reduction reactions, because each successive carrier in the sequence has a greater affinity (force of chemical attraction) for them than the preceding one. Oxygen has the greatest affinity of all for e
−
 and acts as the final e
−
 acceptor. The additional electrons on the oxygen give it a negative charge and attract the positively charged H
+
, thus forming water (

Figure 2.11

). Other H
+
 move back from the intermembrane space to the matrix through the ball-and-stalk apparatus. This movement of the H
+
 activates ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP to ATP.










FIGURE 2.11
 Oxygen as the Final Electron Acceptor.
 A.
 The outer shell of oxygen has room for eight electrons but contains only six. Thus, it can accept two electrons at the end of electron transport. B.
 When oxygen accepts these two electrons, it then has a double negative charge (O2−
). Two hydrogen ions (H+
) are thus attracted, and water (H2
O) is formed.





Thus, the formation of ATP from ADP and P
i
 is coupled to the movement of H
+
 and e
−
 through and along the electron transport chain. The movement of those ions releases energy that is harnessed when ADP is phosphorylated to ATP. Because phosphate is added (phosphorylation) and the NADH + H
+
 and FADH
2
 are oxidized (electrons removed), the term
 oxidative phosphorylation (OP)
 is used to denote this formation of ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which NADH + H
+
 and FADH
2
 are oxidized in the electron transport system and the energy released is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and P
i
. Remember that the process of producing ATP directly in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle was called substrate-level phosphorylation because the P
i
 was transferred directly from phosphorylated intermediates to ADP without any oxidation occurring.






Electron Transport System (ETS)
 The final metabolic pathway, which proceeds as a series of chemical reactions in the mitochondria that transfer electrons from the hydrogen atom carriers NAD and FAD to oxygen; water is formed as a by-product; the electrochemical energy released by the hydrogen ions is coupled to the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi.



Oxidative Phosphorylation (OP)
 The process in which NADH + H+ and FADH2 are oxidized in the electron transport system and the energy released is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi.




THE STEPS OF STAGE IV Again, the series of steps (Frisell, 1982
; Lehninger, 1971
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
; Mougios, 2006
; Newsholme and Leech, 1983
) presented in Figure 2.10
 are necessary so that the energy is preserved rather than released all at once and lost as heat, which would destroy tissue.



Step 1
. NADH + H
+
 arrives at Complex I, transfers the electrons (e
−
) to the complex, and deposits the protons (H
+
) into the mitochondrial matrix.




Step 1a
. This step is really a variation and not a sequential step. If the original hydrogen carrier was FAD instead of NAD
+
, the transfer of electrons and protons occurs at Complex II instead of Complex I.




Step 2a
. The electrons shuttle down the cytochromes, alternately causing the cytochromes to gain (become reduced) and lose (become oxidized) the electrons.




Step 2b
. In this process, electrons also move across the width of the inner membrane, driving the proton pumps that shuttle H
+
 from the matrix to the inner membrane space.




Step 3
. Oxygen accepts the electrons. This increase in negative charge attracts hydrogen ions and causes the formation of water.
 
Figure 2.11

 depicts this step graphically

.




Step 4
. The H
+
 that have been transported into the intermembrane space create an electrochemical gradient. Since the drive is to equalize that gradient, the H
+
 leak back into the mitochondrial matrix through the ball-and-stalk complexes that are the enzyme ATP synthase. The movement of H
+
 creates an electrical current, and this electrical energy, along with the enzyme action, is somehow used to synthesize ATP from ADP + P
i
, both of which are present in the matrix. This occurs three times if the carrier is NADH + H
+
 and twice if the carrier is FADH
2
.




Step 5
. ATP moves into the intermembrane space through the ATP-ADP antiporter protein. For every ATP molecule exported, an ADP molecule is imported. P
i
 is moved into the mitochondrial matrix via the phosphate translocase protein along with one H
+
.




Step 6
. In the final step, the ATP moves out of the mitochondria in exchange for the inward movement of ADP needed for the continual production of energy.

 Cellular Respiration.





ATP Production from Carbohydrate


The number of ATP produced directly by substrate-level phosphorylation and the number of hydrogen atoms being carried by NAD+
 and FAD were described above for each stage. These numbers are summarized in Table 2.1
. From this summary, we can compute the total yield of ATP from one molecule of glucose or glycogen.



TABLE 2.1
 ATP Production from Carbohydrate









*
If glycogen, not glucose, is fuel.



†
Owing to shuttle differences in crossing into mitochondrial membrane, these hydrogen atoms are actually carried by FAD in the mitochondria, reducing the ATP production.





Stage I (glycolysis) yields a gross production of 4 ATP but uses 2 ATP, yielding a net gain of 2 ATP from direct substrate-level phosphorylation, if the substrate is glucose. If the substrate is glycogen, only 1 ATP is used and the net gain is 3 ATP.




Two molecules of NADH + H
+
 are also produced. These hydrogen atoms are transported from the cytoplasm, where glycolysis has taken place, into the mitochondria, if the level of pyruvate is not too high and if there is enough oxygen to accept the electrons at the end of the ETS. However, the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH + H
+
, meaning that the membrane does not allow it to pass through. Therefore, a shuttle system must be employed.




Actually, two shuttle systems appear to operate—one in cardiac muscle and the other in skeletal muscle. The cardiac muscle shuttle system is called the
 malate-aspartate shuttle
. It operates by the NADH + H
+
 in the cytoplasm giving up the hydrogens to malate, which carries them across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, mitochondrial NAD
+
 picks up the H
+
 and enters the ETS (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

).




The skeletal muscle shuttle system is called the
 glycerol-phosphate shuttle
. It operates by the NADH + H
+
 in the cytoplasm giving up the hydrogens to glycerol phosphate, which carries them into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, FAD picks up the H
+
 and enters the ETS. This shuttle predominates in skeletal muscle (

Frisell, 1982

;
 
Lehninger, 1971

;
 
Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

;
 
Mougios, 2006

;
 
Newsholme and Leech, 1983

), although there is some evidence that the malate-aspartate shuttle may operate in Type I slow-twitch oxidative skeletal muscle (

Houston, 1995

).




Because of these different shuttle systems, in heart muscle the ATP yield from the glycolytic hydrogens is higher than in skeletal muscle. In heart muscle the shuttle releases H
+
 to NADH
+
, whereas in skeletal muscle the shuttle releases H
+
 to FAD. As detailed in step 4 above, the amount of ATP produced in ETS/OP depends on where the carrier enters the ETS, with NADH + H
+
 resulting in more ATP produced than FADH
2
. No differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle exist in the ATP production count for any of the remaining stages.




The counts for ATP produced during the oxidative phosphorylation are a little different from those in substrate-level phosphorylation. Theoretically and historically, because the H
+
 moves through ATP synthase ball-and-stalk apparatus in three locations if deposited by NADH + H
+
 and two locations if deposited by FADH
2
, it was assumed that 3 ATP molecules were produced for

 each NADH + H
+
 and 2 ATP molecules were produced for each FADH
2
. The actual number is probably less. Biochemists are currently uncertain (

Mougios, 2006

) because the numbers of H
+
 moving are not necessarily constant but may depend on the energy state of the cell. The best available estimate is that it takes 3 H
+
 moving through ATP synthase to form 1 ATP. However, this actually involves 4 H
+
 to compensate for the 1 H
+
 that enters the mitochondrial matrix with P
i
 through the phosphate translocase (

Figure 2.10

). Thus, the movement of 4 H
+
 results in 1 ATP. The number of H
+
 expelled by the three complexes (I, III, and IV) is thought to be 4 at Complex I, 2 at Complex III, and 4 at Complex IV for a total of 10 H
+
 per NADH + H
+
. Dividing 10 H
+
 by 4 H
+
 for each ATP = 2.5 ATP per NADH + H
+
. FADH
2
 bypasses Complex I. Therefore, the total is only 2 H
+
 at Complex III and 4 H
+
 at Complex IV for a total of 6 H
+
. Dividing 6 H
+
 by 4 H
+
 per ATP = 1.5 ATP per FADH
2
.




Stage II (the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA) yields no substrate-level ATP, but it does produce 2 NADH + H
+
. Since these molecules are already in the mitochondria, they directly enter the ETS. This results in a yield of 5 ATP (2 NADH + H
+
 × 2.5).




Stage III (the Krebs cycle) produces 2 ATP directly by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH + H
+
 at three

 steps, and FADH
2
 at one step. Thus, (3 NADH + H
+
 × 2.5 = 7.5 ATP) + (1 FADH
2
 × 1.5 = 1.5 ATP). Since each step occurs twice for each 6-carbon glucose molecule, this yield must be doubled: 7.5 ATP + 1.5 ATP = 9 ATP × 2 = 18 ATP.




If we add all of these results for skeletal muscle when glucose is the fuel, we get:

Fat Metabolism


Although the body may prefer to use carbohydrate as fuel from the standpoint of oxygen cost, the importance of fat as an energy source should not be underestimated. Fat is found in many common foods. Fat, in the form of triglyceride (sometimes known as triacylglycerol), is the major storage form of energy in humans. Some triglyceride is stored within muscle cells (Figure 2.13
), but the vast majority is deposited in adipose cells (Figure 2.14
), which constitute at least 10–15% of the body weight of average young males and 20–25% of the body weight of average young females (Malina and Bouchard, 1991
). Roughly half of this adipocyte storage occurs subcutaneously (under the skin). The remaining stores surround the major organs of the abdominothoracic cavity as support and protection. Triglycerides are turned over constantly in the body. Because body fat is turned over completely about every 3–4 weeks, no one is literally still carrying their “baby fat” (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
).

 Vogt et al. (2003).











FIGURE 2.14
 Triglyceride Stored in Adipose Tissue.

 Mills (2007).





Fat is an excellent storage fuel for several reasons. First, fat is an energy-dense fuel yielding 9.13 kcal·g
−1
; both carbohydrate and protein yield slightly less than 4 kcal·g
−1
. The difference is due to the chemical structure of the substrates—specifically, the amount of oxidizable carbon and hydrogen. It is easy to appreciate the difference by looking at the chemical composition of the free fatty acid palmitate, which is C
16
H
32
O
2
. This fatty acid has almost three times as much C and H, but only a third as much O as glucose (C
6
H
12
O
6
). Remember that it is H

 atoms that donate the electrons (e
−
) and protons (H
+
) used during electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.




Second, carbohydrate, in the form of glycogen, is stored in the muscles with a large amount of water: 2.7 g of water per gram of dried glycogen. Triglyceride is stored dry. Thus, the energy content of fat is not diluted, and hard as it may be to believe, body bulk is less than would otherwise be necessary. If humans had to store the comparable amount of energy as carbohydrates, we would be at least twice as big (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

)!




Third, glycogen stores are relatively small in comparison to fat stores. A person can deplete stored glycogen in as little as 2 hours of heavy exercise or 1 day of bed rest, whereas fat supplies can last for weeks, even with moderate activity. Although many North Americans and Europeans are concerned about having too much body fat, this storage capacity is undoubtedly important for survival of the species when food is not readily available.




The triglycerides stored in adipose tissue must first be broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids before they can be used as fuel (see earlier
 
Figure 2.2

). One glycerol and three fatty acids make up a triglyceride. Seven fatty acids predominate in the body, but since three fatty acids combine with a glycerol to make up a triglyceride, 343 (7 × 7 × 7) different combinations are possible (

Péronnet et al., 1987

). Some common fatty acids include oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitoleic acid.




Fatty acids may be saturated, unsaturated, or polyunsaturated. A saturated fatty acid has a chemical bonding arrangement that allows it to hold as many hydrogen atoms as possible. Thus, the term “saturated” means “saturated with hydrogen.” Unsaturated fatty acids have a chemical bonding arrangement with a reduced-hydrogen binding potential and therefore are unsaturated with respect to hydrogen atoms. Polyunsaturated means several bonds are without hydrogen.




The breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids is catalyzed by two enzymes: adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (

Spriet, 2012

). The glycerol is soluble in blood, but the free fatty acids (FFAs) are not. Glycerol can enter glycolysis in the cytoplasm (as 3-phosphoglycerate, the product of step 7 in
 
Figure 2.6

), but it is not typically utilized by muscle cells in this way (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

;
 
Péronnet et al., 1987

). The direct role of glycerol as a fuel in the muscle cells during exercise is so minor that it need not be considered. However, glycerol can be converted to glucose by the liver.




FFA must be transported in the blood bound to albumin. Specific receptor sites on the muscle cell membrane take up the FFA into the cell where movement occurs via specific transport proteins (

Spriet, 2012

). The FFA must then be translocated or transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. Once in the mitochondrial matrix, the FFA undergoes the process of beta-oxidation (

Figure 2.15

).










FIGURE 2.15
 Beta-Oxidation.




Beta-Oxidatio
n



Beta-oxidation
 is a cyclic series of steps that breaks off successive pairs of carbon atoms from FFA, which are then used to form acetyl CoA. Remember that acetyl CoA is the common intermediate by which all foodstuffs enter the Krebs cycle and ETS/OP stage. The number of cycles depends upon the number of carbon atoms; most fatty acids have 14–24 carbons.





Beta-oxidation
 A cyclic series of steps that breaks off successive pairs of carbon atoms from FFA, which are then used to form acetyl CoA.





When there is an adequate supply of oxaloacetate to combine with, the fat-derived acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle and proceeds through electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.
 
Figure 2.15

 shows the steps of beta-oxidation, which are explained next.




As with glycolysis, ATP is used for activation; but unlike glycolysis, beta-oxidation produces no ATP directly by substrate-level phosphorylation.



THE STEPS OF BETA-OXIDATION Step 1
. The fatty acid molecule is activated by the breakdown of 1 ATP to AMP, releasing the energy equivalent of 2 ATP if broken down as it is normally to ADP. Concurrently, coenzyme A is added.



Step 2
. FAD is reduced to FADH
2
. The FADH
2
 enters the electron transport chain and produces 1.5 ATP (actual count).




Step 3
. A molecule of water is added, and NAD
+
 is reduced to NADH + H
+
. The NADH + H
+
 will enter the electron transport chain and produce 2.5 ATP. Steps 2 and 3, with the removal of the hydrogen atoms, account for the oxidation portion of the name for this process.




Step 4
. The bond between the alpha (α) carbon (C
2
) and the beta (β) carbon (C
3
) is broken, resulting in the removal of two carbon atoms (C
1
 and C
2
), which are then used to form acetyl CoA. The cleavage of carbons at the site of the beta carbon explains why the process is called beta-oxidation.




Step 5
. Steps 1–4 are repeated for each pair of carbons except the last, since the last unit formed is acetyl CoA itself. Therefore, the number of cycles that must be completed to oxidize the fat can be computed using the formula
 n
/2 − 1 where
 n
 is the number of carbons. The acetyl CoA can enter the Krebs cycle and electron transport system (see earlier
 
Figures 2.2

,
 
2.9

, and
 
2.10

).



ATP Production from Fatty Acids


The number of ATP produced from the breakdown of fat depends on which fatty acid is utilized. The following example shows a calculation of ATP production for palmitate.






Example






Calculate the number of ATP produced from the breakdown of palmitate (palmitic acid). The steps in the calculation follow:





1.
 Palmitate is a 16-carbon fatty acid. Therefore, as noted in the previous step 5, it cycles through beta-oxidation
 n
/2−1 =16/2 − 1 = 7 times.




2.
 Each cycle produces 1 FADH
2
 and 1 NADH + H
+
, as follows:










This reaction happens 7 times: 7 × 4 = 28 ATP.






1.
 Each cycle (7) plus the last step (1) produces acetyl CoA, for a total of 8. Each acetyl CoA yields 1 ATP, 3 NADH + H
+
, and 1 FADH
2
 in the Krebs cycle. The 3 NADH + H
+
 will produce 7.5 ATP, and the FADH
2
 will produce 1.5 ATP in the electron transport system. Thus, 10 ATP are produced for each acetyl CoA, for a total of 8 acetyl CoA × 10 ATP = 80 ATP.




2.
 Add the results of steps 2 and 3: 80 ATP + 28 ATP = 108 ATP produced.




3.
 1 ATP was utilized in step 1 of beta-oxidation to activate the fatty acid. However, this ATP was broken down to AMP, not ADP; thus the equivalent of 2 ATP was used.




4.
 Subtracting the ATP used from the total ATP produced, we get 108 ATP − 2 ATP = 106 net ATP from palmitate

.





Recall that three acids plus one glycerol make up a triglyceride. These calculations apply to a single specific fatty acid. Complete the Check Your Comprehension 2

CHECK YOUR COMPREHENSION 2






To check your understanding of the ATP yield from fatty acids, calculate the count for ATP produced from an 18-carbon fatty acid, such as stearate. Check your answer in Appendix C.






Ketone Bodies and Ketosis


As mentioned earlier, in order for the acetyl CoA produced by beta-oxidation to enter the Krebs cycle, a sufficient amount of oxaloacetate is necessary. When carbohydrate supplies are sufficient, this is no problem, and fat is said to burn in the flame of carbohydrate. However, when carbohydrates are inadequate (perhaps as a result of fasting, prolonged exercise, or diabetes mellitus), oxaloacetate is converted to glucose. The production of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources under these conditions is necessary because some tissue, such as the brain and nervous system, rely predominantly on glucose for fuel (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
).



When oxaloacetate is converted to glucose and is therefore not available to combine with acetyl CoA to form citrate, the liver converts the acetyl CoA derived from the fatty acids into metabolites called
 ketones
 or
 ketone bodies
. Despite the similarity in the names, do not confuse ketones with keto acids (pyruvic acid and the Krebs cycle intermediates) (

Figure 2.9

). There are three forms of ketones: acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone. All are strong acids. Acetone gives the breath a very characteristic fruity smell.




Ketone bodies themselves can be used as fuel by muscles, nerves, and the brain. If the ketones are not used but, instead, accumulate, a condition called
 ketosis
 occurs. The high acidity of ketosis can disrupt normal physiological functioning, especially acid-base balance. Ketosis is more likely to result from an inadequate diet (as in anorexia nervosa) or diabetes than from prolonged exercise, since the muscles will use the ketones as fuel. During exercise, aerobically trained individuals can utilize ketones more effectively than can untrained individuals.



Protein Metabolism


Proteins are present in many food sources. Proteins are large molecules consisting of varying combinations of amino acids linked together. Approximately 20 amino acids occur naturally (Kapit et al., 1987
). Because there are so many ways these amino acids can combine, the number of possible proteins is almost infinite. Like carbohydrates and fats, amino acids contain atoms of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. In addition, they may include sulfur, phosphorus, and iron. All amino acids have in common an amino group containing nitrogen (NH2
).



Proteins are extremely important in the structure and function of the body. Among other things, they are components of hemoglobin, contractile elements of the muscle, hormones, fibrin for clotting, tendons, ligaments, and portions of all cell membranes. Because proteins are so important in the body, the constituent amino acids are used predominantly as building blocks, not as a source of energy.




However, amino acids can be, and in certain instances are, used as a fuel source. When amino acids are used as a fuel source, muscles appear to preferentially, but not exclusively, utilize the group of amino acids known as branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), that is, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. In this situation, as with carbohydrate and fat metabolism, the final common pathways of the Krebs cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation are utilized. The site of entry into the metabolic pathways varies, as shown in
 
Figure 2.2

, with the amino acids.




Six amino acids can enter metabolism at the level of pyruvic acid, 8 at acetyl CoA, 4 at alpha-ketoglutarate, 4 at succinate, 2 at fumarate, and 2 at oxaloacetate. All of these intermediates except acetyl CoA are, in turn, converted to pyruvate before being used to produce energy. The acetyl CoA is used directly in the Krebs cycle and electron transport, as previously described.



Transamination and Oxidative Deamination


Before amino acids can be used as a fuel and enter the pathways at any place, the nitrogen-containing amino group (the NH2
) must be removed. It is removed by the process of transamination and sometimes by oxidative deamination (Frisell, 1982
; Lehninger, 1971
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
; Mougios, 2006
; Newsholme and Leech, 1983
). These processes are summarized in Table 2.2
.



TABLE 2.2
 Transamination and Oxidative Deamination






All but two amino acids appear to be able to undergo transamination
. Transamination involves the transfer of the NH2
 amino group from an amino acid to a keto acid. Remember that keto acids include pyruvic acid, acetyl CoA, and the Krebs cycle intermediates. This process occurs in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, predominantly in muscle and liver cells. Transamination results in the formation of a new amino acid and a different keto acid. The most frequent keto acid acceptor of NH2
 is α-ketoglutarate, with glutamate being the amino acid formed (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
; Mougios, 2006
).



Two fates for glutamate are shown in
 
Table 2.2

. In the first, glutamate is transaminated to alanine, another amino acid. Alanine, in turn, can be converted to glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis (

Frisell, 1982

;
 
Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

).
 Gluconeogenesis
 is the creation of glucose in the liver from noncarbohydrate sources, particularly glycerol, lactate or pyruvate, and alanine.

In the second process, glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination. In
 oxidative deamination
, the NH
2
 amino group is removed from the amino acid forming a keto acid and ammonia. That is, the oxidized form of NAD (NAD
+
) is reduced (NADH + H
+
), the amino group (NH
2
) is removed, and NH
3
 is formed. NH
3
 is ammonia, which in high concentrations in the body is extremely toxic. The dominant pathway for NH
3
 removal is by conversion to urea in the liver (via the urea cycle) and excretion in urine by the kidneys. Oxidative deamination is used much less frequently than transamination.



ATP Production from Amino Acids


Because the amino acid derivatives are ultimately utilized as pyruvate or acetyl CoA, the ATP production count from the amino acids is the same as for glucose from that point on, except that it is not doubled (Péronnet et al., 1987
). Refer to Figure 2.6
 to remind yourself why the double count occurs with glucose and to Figure 2.2
 to see amino acids entering the pathways denoted next.







This is the first time we have seen a total indicating a fraction of ATP. Interpret this as an average, not literally. ATP molecules do not exist in halves. Acetyl CoA would produce 10 ATP, because the NADH+H
+
 production from pyruvate to acetyl CoA would be the only step missing.





The Regulation of Cellular Respiration and ATP Production




Intracellular Regulation


Intracellularly, the production of ATP—and, hence, the flow of substrates through the various metabolic pathways—is regulated predominantly by feedback mechanisms. Again, each step in each metabolic pathway is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. At least one of these enzymes in each pathway can be acted on directly by other chemicals in the cell and, as a result, increases or decreases its activity. Such an enzyme is called a rate-limiting enzyme
, and the other factors that influence it are called modulators. When the rate-limiting enzyme is
 inhibited, every step in the metabolic pathway beyond that point is also inhibited. When the rate-limiting enzyme is stimulated, every step in the metabolic pathway beyond that point is also stimulated.



The primary rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis is phosphofructokinase (PFK), the enzyme that catalyzes step 3. PFK is stimulated, and subsequently the rate of glycolysis increased, by modulators such as ADP, AMP, P
i
, and a rise in pH. ADP, AMP, and P
i
 modulators are the result of the breakdown of ATP. This is an example of a positive-feedback system in which the by-product of the utilization of a substance stimulates a greater production of that original substance. Conversely, PFK is inhibited, and subsequently the rate of glycolysis decreased, by the modulators ATP, CP, citrate (a Krebs cycle intermediate), FFA, and a drop in pH. Each of these modulators signals that sufficient substances exist to supply ATP. This is an example of a negative-feedback system in which the formation of a product or other similarly acting product inhibits further production of the product (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

).




The primary rate-limiting enzyme in the Krebs cycle is isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), which catalyzes step 3. ICD is stimulated by ADP, P
i
, and calcium (positive feedback), and is inhibited by ATP (negative feedback) (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

).




Cytochrome oxidase—which catalyzes the transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of water—is the rate-limiting enzyme for the electron transport system. It is stimulated by ADP and P
i
 (positive feedback) and is inhibited by ATP (negative feedback) (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

).




A pattern in the modulators is readily evident, with ATP, ADP, and P
i
 being universally important. When ATP is present in sufficient amounts to satisfy the needs of the cell and to provide some reserve in storage, there is no need to increase its production. Thus, key enzymes in the metabolic pathways are inhibited. However, when muscle activity begins and ATP is broken down into ADP and P
i
, these by-products stimulate all the metabolic pathways to produce more ATP so that the muscle contractions can continue.



Extracellular Regulation


During exercise, metabolic processes must provide ATP for energy and maintain blood glucose levels at near-resting values for the proper functioning of the entire organism. This is because the brain and nervous tissue must have glucose as a fuel. One of the ways of maintaining glucose levels is by the process of gluconeogenesis.


Gluconeogenesis


As defined earlier, gluconeogenesis is the creation (-genesis) of new (-neo) glucose (gluco-) in the liver from noncarbohydrate sources. The primary fuel sources for gluconeogenesis are glycerol, lactate or pyruvate, and alanine. Glycerol is released into the bloodstream when triglycerides are broken down (Figure 2.16A
).









FIGURE 2.16
 Gluconeogenesis.
 A. Glycerol-glucose cycle. B. Cori cycle. C. Felig cycle.





Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis. The majority of the pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA and enters the Krebs cycle and electron transport system. However, a small portion diffuses out of the muscle cell and into the bloodstream (

Péronnet et al., 1987

). Still another portion of the pyruvate is converted to lactate, which also diffuses into the bloodstream. About 10 times as much lactate as pyruvate diffuses out of the muscle cells (

Figure 2.16B

).




Alanine is formed by transamination when the amino group from one amino acid (preferentially, the BCAA or an amino acid derived from glutamate) is transferred to pyruvate (

Figure 2.16C

). Note that in the liver alanine is first reconverted to pyruvate (freeing the NH
3
 to enter the urea cycle and be excreted) before being converted to glucose.




In all cases, the conversion to glucose takes place in the liver. For each gram of glucose produced, 1.02 g of glycerol, 1.43 g of pyruvate, 1.23 g of lactate, or 1.45 g of alanine is utilized (

Péronnet et al., 1987

)

.




The glycerol-glucose cycle has no special name, but the pyruvate/lactate-glucose cycle is known as the
 Cori cycle
, and the alanine-glucose cycle is called the
 Felig cycle
. The Cori and Felig cycles help maintain normal blood glucose levels so that the brain, nerves, and kidneys as well as the muscles may draw from this supply.



Neurohormonal Coordination


The regulation of blood glucose levels, including gluconeogenesis, is governed jointly by the autonomic nervous system (particularly the sympathetic division) and the endocrine system, which function in a coordinated fashion. Figure 2.17
 shows this integration of the two control systems for the regulation of energy production in response to exercise. Chapter 21
 provides a comprehensive explanation of the functioning of the neurohormonal system.

When exercise begins, signals from the working muscles and motor centers in the central nervous system bring about a neurohormonal response mediated through the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus stimulates both the anterior pituitary and the sympathetic nervous system. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine is released directly from sympathetic nerve endings, and the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are released from the adrenal medulla. Epinephrine and norepinephrine both act directly on fuel sites and stimulate the anterior pituitary and pancreas. As a result of the dual stimulation of the anterior pituitary, hormones are released—namely, growth hormone, cortisol, and thyroxine. The release of insulin is inhibited from the pancreas, but glucagon release is stimulated (

Bunt, 1986

;
 
Galbo, 1983

). In general, there are three results (see also
 
Table 2.3

):




TABLE 2.3
 Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism during Exercise









*

†
Nonactive cells.


↑, Increases; ↓, Decreases.





1.
 An increase in the mobilization and utilization of free fatty acid stores from extramuscular (adipose tissue) and intramuscular stores.




2.
 An increase in the breakdown of extramuscular (liver) and intramuscular stores of glycogen and the formation of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources (gluconeogenesis) in the liver.




3.
 A decrease in the uptake of glucose into the nonworking cells.




A two-tier system of hormonal involvement appears to operate on the basis of either a fast or slow time of response. The catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and glucagon react to an increase in muscular activity in a matter of seconds to minutes. Both assist in all three metabolic functions listed above, although not equally. Epinephrine’s influence on fat metabolism is far greater than its effect on glucose metabolism (

Hall, 2016

).







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Metabolic Pathways: The Vitamin Connection






Many individuals mistakenly believe that vitamins are a source of energy for the body. Although this is not true, vitamins do participate in many of the chemical reactions described in this chapter that convert the potential energy of food sources into ATP. Your body cannot produce energy without vitamins. In general, the ingestion of a well-balanced diet (the fuel source) provides the needed vitamins. Conversely, the ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamins does not increase the activity of the enzymes for which the vitamins act as coenzymes. Listed in the table are the six vitamins that are particularly important for energy metabolism, their actions, and selected dietary sources. Check to see that you are getting all of these in your diet.

The actions of the catecholamines and glucagon are backed up by growth hormone and cortisol, respectively. The response of growth hormone and cortisol may take hours to become maximal. Thus, these latter two hormones are probably most important for carbohydrate conservation during long-duration activity. This explains why growth hormone and cortisol can bring about glycogen synthesis, while glucagon and the catecholamines cannot (

Hall, 2016

).




Insulin secretion is suppressed during exercise. This decrease in insulin and the increase in glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol cause a decrease in the glucose uptake into cells other than the working muscles. The

 available glucose is thus spared for the working muscles and the nervous system.




During exercise, the working muscles become highly permeable to glucose despite the lack of insulin. As previously noted, the muscle contraction itself stimulates GLUT-4 translocation to the cell surface for the movement of glucose into the working muscle (

Houston, 1995

;
 
Sato et al., 1996

). The contractile process also helps to break down the intramuscular stores of glycogen and triglycerides (

Galbo, 1983

;
 
Hall, 2016

).




The increases in protein breakdown and in amino acid transport caused by growth hormone and cortisol are important in providing protein precursors for gluconeogenesis. The fact that these hormones

 are slow responders also explains why protein is not used in significant amounts except in long-duration activity.




Because the mobilization of free fatty acids involves the breakdown of triglycerides, glycerol is also released and made available for gluconeogenesis. Note that an accumulation of the other gluconeogenic precursor, lactate, inhibits free fatty acid release from adipose tissue. Therefore, gluconeogenesis serves a dual purpose in helping to provide glucose and reducing the levels of lactate so that it does not interfere as much with fat utilization.




Thyroxine itself has a number of metabolic functions. However, its role in exercise metabolism appears to be one of potentiation or permissiveness. That is, it helps to create an environment in which the other metabolic hormones can function more effectively, rather than having any major effect itself.




The level of response and reaction to all of these hormones depends on the following:




1.
 The type, duration, and intensity of the exercise; relative intensity appears to be more important than the absolute workload.




2.
 The nutritional status, health, training status, and fiber-type composition of the exerciser.




3.
 The size of the fuel depots, the state of the hormone receptors, and the capacity of the involved enzymes (

Galbo, 1983

).





Fuel Utilization at Rest and during Exercise




Preceding sections explain how each of the major fuel sources—fats, carbohydrates, and proteins—are converted to ATP energy for the human body. At rest, it has been estimated that fats contribute 41–67%, carbohydrates 33–42%, and proteins from just a trace to 17% of the total daily energy requirements of the human body (Lemon and Nagel, 1981
).



During exercise, various forms of each fuel are utilized to supply working muscles with the additional ATP energy needed to sustain movement. To understand which energy sources are used during exercise, it is first necessary to know approximately how much of each energy substrate is available.
 
Table 2.4

 shows the tissue fuel stores in an average adult male who weighs 65 kg, has 8.45 kg (13%) body fat, and 30 kg of muscle. Protein stores are omitted because the major tissue storage of protein is in the muscles, and complete degradation (breakdown) of muscle to sustain energy metabolism is neither realistic nor desirable under normal circumstances.

†
Calculations assume that each fuel is the only fuel utilized. In reality, the fuels are utilized with mixtures that depend on the type, intensity, and duration of the activity and training, fiber-type proportions, and nutritional status of the exerciser.

Several important points should be noted in
 
Table 2.4

. First, triglycerides provide the greatest source of potential energy (77,150 kcal is enough energy to sustain life for ~47 days!). Second, comparatively, very little carbohydrate is actually stored. In fact, the human body’s stores of carbohydrate are only enough to support life

 for 1 ¼ days, if all three sources (muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, and circulating glucose) are added together. Thus, carbohydrate replenishment on a regular basis is essential. Third, exercise has a major impact on how long each fuel can supply energy.





Table 2.4

 assumes that each fuel is acting independently, which in fact never happens.
 
Tables 2.5

 and
 
2.6

 provide more realistic views of what actually happens during exercise.
 
Table 2.5

 depicts the relative utilization of each substrate source based on the type, intensity, and duration of the activity. Very-short-duration, very-high-intensity dynamic activity and static contractions are special cases that rely predominantly on energy substrates stored in the muscle fibers—that is, ATP-PC and glycogen (which can quickly be broken down into ATP to provide energy).

The other exercises listed in
 
Table 2.5

 are assumed to be predominantly dynamic and to a large extent aerobic (utilizing oxygen). In general, the lower the intensity, the more important fat is as a fuel; the higher the intensity, the more important carbohydrates are as fuel. At higher exercise intensities, fat utilization is compromised because of decreased blood flow to adipose tissue, decreased release of FFA into the blood stream to be delivered to skeletal muscle, decreased breakdown of intramuscular triglycerides, and decreased transport of FFA into skeletal muscles mitochondria, in part because of reductions in muscle pH (

Holloway and Spriet, 2012

). Duration has a similar effect: the shorter the duration, the more important carbohydrates are as a fuel, with fat being utilized more and more as the duration lengthens. Fats come into play over the long term because the glycogen stores can and will be depleted. Indeed, long-duration activities often exhibit a three-part sequence in which muscle glycogen, blood-borne glucose (including glucose that has been broken down from liver glycogen and glucose that has been created by gluconeogenesis), and fatty acids successively predominate as the major fuel source. Protein may account for 5–15% of the total energy supply in activities lasting more than an hour (

Felig and Wahren, 1975

;
 
Lemon and Nagel, 1981

;
 
Pernow and Saltin, 1971

).







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Sex Differences in Substrate Utilization






The data presented in Tables 2.5
 and
 2.6
 show variations not only in the reliance on carbohydrate, fat, and protein substrates based on exercise intensity, but also among the various components of carbohydrate used as a fuel (glucose, and muscle and liver glycogen). Data from this study by Friedlander et al. demonstrate that there might also be meaningful variations among fuel substrates between the sexes. Substrate utilization in young adult males and females was determined at rest and at 45% 

 peak and 65% 

 peak exercise intensities on a cycle ergometer. Although only those comparisons marked with an asterisk (*) in the accompanying graphs attained statistical significance, the overall pattern seen in panel (A) is that carbohydrates provided a higher percentage of the total energy supply for males than for females. Conversely, the pattern in panel (B) shows that the females used relatively more glucose than other carbohydrate sources (presumably glycogen and lactate) than did the males. Both of these trends were true at rest before (UT) and after (TR) training, at the two submaximal power outputs pretraining (45% UT and 65% UT), at the same absolute power output pretraining and posttraining (65% UT and 65% TR), and at the new relative power output posttraining (65% TR).







The mechanism that explains these differences is unknown. However, the authors speculate that hormonal differences may have been the cause. Factors that may influence these differences include the amount of circulating epinephrine (although these values did not differ between the males and females in this study), receptor availability and affinity for epinephrine (which was not tested), or the interaction of other circulating hormones, especially estrogen and progesterone (higher, of course, in the females) with epinephrine. It is also possible, because many of the differences were significant only after training that the sympathetic nervous system in males and females may adapt differently to exercise training.

Table 2.6

 provides an estimation of how fuel utilization varies by race distance (10 km [6.2 mi] and 42.2 km

 [26.2 mi], or marathon distance) and performance (a “fast” and a “slow” time for each distance). Compare the muscle glycogen utilization in the fast and the slow conditions. At the short distance (10 km) there is not much difference, but during the marathon almost six times as much muscle glycogen is used by the faster runner. Conversely, the greatest amount of fat is utilized by the slow marathoner. Circulating glucose use is much higher in marathoners because the longer duration and lower intensity permit the liver to generate (by gluconeogenesis) and release glucose into the bloodstream. The 10-km runner has sufficient muscle glycogen stores and does not need to rely on external glucose production. Very little protein (BCAA) is used by either of the 10-km runners, but a small amount provides some energy for the marathoners.




A complex interaction exists between exercise energy needs and the fuel sources that provide this energy within the human organism.





SUMMARY





1.
 The process by which ATP is formed from food is called cellular respiration.




2.
 Carbohydrate metabolism consists of four stages that convert glucose or glycogen into carbon dioxide, water, and ATP energy.




3.
 Stage I of carbohydrate metabolism is known as glycolysis. Glycolysis consists of a series of 10 or 11 steps; it occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and is anaerobic. It begins with glucose or glycogen and ends with pyruvate (pyruvic acid) or lactate (lactic acid). In the process, a net gain of 2 ATP molecules is achieved by substrate-level phosphorylation if the fuel was glucose and 3 ATP if the fuel was glycogen. A pair of NADH + H
+
 also results.




4.
 Stage II of carbohydrate metabolism has no identifying name, but it results in the formation of acetyl CoA from pyruvate. These two steps occur

 in the mitochondrial matrix; although no oxygen is used directly, the process must be aerobic. No ATP is produced, but two pairs of hydrogen atoms are released and picked up by NAD
+
, forming NADH + H
+
.




5.
 Stage III of carbohydrate metabolism is the Krebs cycle. This stage consists of eight steps and also occurs in the mitochondrial matrix; again, no oxygen is used directly, but it also must be aerobic. Two ATP are produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and pairs of hydrogen atoms are removed at four separate steps. In three cases, the hydrogen ions are picked up by NAD
+
 and in the fourth by FAD.




6.
 Stage IV of carbohydrate metabolism is known as electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Electron transport takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of relaying electrons from the hydrogen atoms from one protein carrier to another and transporting the hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space. In the process, an electrical current is created. This electrical energy is then used to synthesize ATP from ADP by the addition of a phosphate as the H
+
 move through the ball-and-stalk apparatus (ATP synthase) into the mitochondrial matrix. For each hydrogen carried to the ETS by NAD+, 2.5 ATP molecules are formed. For each hydrogen carried by FAD to the electron transport chain, 1.5 ATP are formed, lower than the previously thought theoretical values of 3 and 2, respectively.




7.
 A total of 30 ATP molecules are produced if the fuel substrate is glucose and the muscle is skeletal. A total of 31 ATP are produced if the fuel substrate is glycogen and the muscle is skeletal. A total of 32 ATP are produced if the fuel substrate is glucose and the muscle is cardiac. A total of 33 ATP are produced if the fuel substrate is glycogen and the muscle is cardiac.




8.
 Triglycerides stored in adipose cells or stored intramuscularly are the major storage form of energy in humans. Triglycerides are composed of fatty acids and glycerol. Muscle cells can only use fatty acids as a fuel.




9.
 Fatty acid can only be utilized as a fuel source aerobically within the mitochondria. Fatty acids must undergo the process of beta-oxidation—which involves the removal of hydrogen atoms (oxidation) and the removal of pairs of carbons (at the beta carbon location) to form acetyl coenzyme A—before entering the Krebs cycle and electron transport.




10.
 The ATP produced from each fatty acid depends upon the number of carbon pairs.




11.
 When glucose supplies are inadequate and oxaloacetate must be converted to glucose, the acetyl coenzyme A derived from fatty acids is converted into three forms of ketones: acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone.




12.
 Amino acids are used primarily in anabolic processes in human cells, building proteins such as hemoglobin and the contractile elements of muscle. However, amino acids—and especially the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine)—can be used as a fuel source and may contribute as much as 5–15% of the energy supply in long-term, dynamic-endurance activity.




13.
 All amino acids contain an amino group (NH
2
). Before an amino acid can be used as a fuel, this amino group must be removed. Removal of the amino group is accomplished by two processes: oxidative deamination or transamination (most common). Entry into the Krebs cycle and electron transport then occurs at several locations, but ultimately all of the intermediates except acetyl CoA are converted to pyruvate before being used to produce energy.




14.
 Twelve-and-a-half ATP are derived from each of the amino acid derivatives utilized as pyruvate, and 10 ATP are produced from each derivative utilized as acetyl CoA.




15.
 ATP energy production has both intracellular and extracellular regulation. Intracellular regulation operates primarily by the feedback stimulation (by ADP, AMP, P
i
, and a rise in pH) or inhibition (by ATP, CP, citrate, and a drop in pH) of the rate-limiting enzyme. Extracellular regulation is achieved by the coordinated action of the sympathetic nervous system (via norepinephrine) and the hormonal system (norepinephrine, epinephrine, glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol).




16.
 The goal of metabolism during exercise is threefold:




a.
 To increase the mobilization and utilization of free fatty acid from adipose tissue and intramuscular stores.




b.
 To decrease the uptake of glucose into nonworking muscle cells while at the same time providing glucose for nerve and brain cells.




c.
 To increase the breakdown of liver and muscle stores of glycogen and create glucose from noncarbohydrate sources in the liver.




17.
 The creation of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources is called gluconeogenesis. The primary fuel sources for gluconeogenesis are glycerol, lactate or pyruvate, and alanine.




18.
 Fatty acids constitute the largest fuel supply. Other fuels, in descending order, are total muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, and circulating glucose.




19.
 Which energy substrate is utilized and in what amounts depends upon the complex interaction of the type, duration, and intensity of exercise; the proportion of muscle fiber types involved; and the training status, long-term nutritional state, and short-term dietary status of the exerciser.




20.
 In general, very-short-duration, very-high-intensity dynamic activity and static contractions are special cases that rely predominantly on the ATP-PC and glycogen stored in the muscle fibers.




21.
 In dynamic aerobic activity the higher the intensity, the more important carbohydrates (glucose and glycogen) are as a fuel; the lower the intensity, the more important fats are as a fuel. Likewise, the shorter the duration, the more important carbohydrates are as

 a fuel; the longer the duration, the more that fat is utilized. In activities lasting more than an hour, protein makes a small but important contribution to the energy supply.
