Introduction




In the 1966 science fiction movie Fantastic Voyage
 (CBS/Fox), a military medical team is miniaturized in a nuclear-powered submarine and injected through a hypodermic needle into the carotid artery. Anticipating an easy float into the brain, where they plan to remove a blood clot by laser beam, they are both awed by what they see and imperiled by what befalls them. They see erythrocytes turning from an iridescent blue to vivid red as oxygen bubbles replace carbon dioxide; nerve impulses appear as bright flashes of light; and when their sub loses air pressure, all they need to do is tap into an alveolus. Not all of their encounters are so benign, however. They are sucked into a whirlpool caused by an abnormal fistula between the carotid artery and jugular vein. They have to get the outside team to stop the heart so that they will not be crushed by its contraction. They are jostled about by the conduction of sound waves in the inner ear. They are attacked by antibodies. And finally, their submarine is destroyed by a white blood cell—they are, after all, foreign bodies to the natural defense system. Of course, in the end, the “good guys” on the team escape through a tear duct, and all is well.



Although the journey you are about to take through the human body will not be quite so literal, it will be just as incredible and fascinating, for it goes beyond the basics of anatomy and physiology into the realm of the moving human. The body is capable of great feats, whose limits and full benefits in terms of exercise and sport are still unknown.




Consider these events and changes, all of which have probably taken place within the life span of your grandparents.







President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack on September 23, 1955. At that time, the normal medical treatment was 6 weeks of bed rest and a lifetime of curtailed activity (Hellerstein, 1979
). Eisenhower’s rehabilitation, including a return to golf, was, if not revolutionary, certainly progressive. Today, cardiac patients are mobilized within days and frequently train for and safely run marathons.






The 4-minute mile was considered an unbreakable limit until May 6, 1954, when Roger Bannister ran the mile in 3:59.4. Hundreds of runners (including some high school boys) have since accomplished that feat. The men’s world record for the mile, which was set in 1999, is 3:43.13. The women’s mile record, of 4:12.56 set in 1996, is approaching the old 4-minute “barrier.”






The 800-m run was banned from the Olympics from 1928 to 1964 for women because females were considered to be “too weak and delicate” to run such a “long” distance. In the 1950s when the 800-m run was reintroduced for women in Europe, ambulances were stationed at the finish line, motors running, to carry off the casualties (Ullyot, 1976
). In 1963, the women’s world marathon record (then not an Olympic sport for women) was 3:37.07, a time now commonly achieved by females not considered to be elite athletes. The women’s world best “mixed gender” time (meaning achieved in a race in which men also competed) was set in 2003 at 2:15.25, an improvement of 1:21.42 (37.5%).






In 1954, Kraus and Hirschland published a report indicating that American children were less fit than European children (Kraus and Hirschland, 1954
). These results started the physical fitness movement. At that time, being fit was defined as being able to pass the Kraus-Weber test of minimal muscular fitness, which consisted of one each of the following: bent-leg sit-up; straight-leg sit-up; standing toe touch; double-leg lift, prone; double-leg lift, supine; and trunk extension, prone. Today (as is discussed in detail later in this chapter), physical fitness is more broadly defined in terms of both physiology and specificity (health-related and sport-related), and its importance for individuals of all ages is widely recognized.






These changes and a multitude of others that we readily accept as normal have come about as a combined result of formal medical and scientific research and informal experimentation by individuals with the curiosity and courage to try new things.




What Is Exercise Physiology and Why Study It?




The events and changes described above exemplify concerns in the broad area of exercise physiology, that is, athletic performance, physical fitness, health, and rehabilitation. Exercise physiology
 can be defined as both a basic and an applied science that describes, explains, and uses the body’s response to exercise and adaptation to exercise training to maximize human physical potential.







Exercise Physiology
 A basic and an applied science that describes, explains, and uses the body’s response to exercise and adaptation to exercise training to maximize human physical potential.







No single course or textbook, of course, can provide all the information a prospective professional will need. However, knowledge of exercise physiology and an appreciation for practice based on research findings help set professionals in the field apart from mere practitioners. It is one thing to be able to lead yoga routines. It is another to be able to design routines based on predictable short- and long-term responses of given class members, to evaluate those responses, and then to modify the sessions as needed. To become respected professionals in fields related to exercise science and physical education, students need to learn exercise physiology in order to:




1.
 Understand how the basic physiological functioning of the human body is modified by various types of exercise as well as the mechanisms causing these changes. Unless one knows what responses are normal, one cannot recognize an abnormal response or adjust to it.




2.
 Understand how the basic physiological functioning of the human body is modified by various training

 programs and the mechanisms responsible for these changes. Adaptations will be specific to the training program used.




3.
 Provide quality fitness programming and physical education programs in schools that stimulate children and adolescents both physically and intellectually. To become lifelong exercisers, individuals need to understand how physical activity can benefit them, why they take physical fitness tests, and what to do with fitness test results.




4.
 Apply the results of scientific research to maximize health, rehabilitation, and/or athletic performance in a variety of subpopulations.




5.
 Respond accurately to questions and advertising claims, as well as recognize myths and misconceptions regarding exercise. Good advice should be based on scientific evidence.





Overview of the Text




Just as the fitness participant, athlete (Figure 1.1
), or even musician warms up before working out, competing, or performing, this chapter is intended to provide you, the learner, with an essential warm-up for the rest of the text. That is, it provides the basic information that will prepare you to successfully understand what follows in the text and accomplish the goals stated above. To do this, the textbook is first divided into four units: metabolic system, cardiovascular-respiratory system, neuromuscular-skeletal system, and neuroendocrine-immune system. To facilitate learning, each unit follows a consistent format:









FIGURE 1.1

c.
 Laboratory techniques and variables typically measured




2.

3.

a.

b.

4.
 Special applications, problems, and considerations




Each unit first deals with basic anatomical structures and physiological functions necessary to understand the material that follows. Then, each unit describes the acute responses to exercise. Following are specific applications of the training principles and discussion of the typical adaptations that occur when the training principles are applied correctly. Finally, each unit ends with one or more special application topics, such as thermal concerns, weight control/body composition, and osteoporosis. This integrated approach demonstrates the relevance of applying basic information.




More exercise physiology research has been done on college-age males and elite male athletes than on any other portion of the population. Nonetheless, wherever possible, we provide information about both sexes as well as children and adolescents at one end of the age spectrum and older adults at the other, throughout the unit.




Each unit is independent of the other three, although the body obviously functions as a whole. Your course, therefore, may sequence these units of study in a different order other than just going from
 
Chapter 1

 to
 
Chapter 22

. After this first chapter, your instructor may start with any unit and then move in any order through the other three. This concept is represented by the circle and cross arrows in
 
Figure 1.2

.










FIGURE 1.2
 Schematic Representation of Text Organization.







Figure 1.2

 also illustrates two other important points: (1) all of the systems respond to exercise in an integrated fashion, and (2) the responses of the systems are interdependent. The metabolic system produces cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is used for muscular contraction. For the cells (including muscle cells) to produce ATP, they must be supplied with oxygen and fuel (foodstuffs). The respiratory system brings oxygen into the body via the lungs, and the cardiovascular system distributes oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body via the blood pumped by the heart through the blood vessels. During exercise, all these functions must increase. The neuroendocrine-immune system regulates and integrates both resting and exercise body functions.




Each unit is divided into multiple chapters depending on the amount and depth of the material. Each chapter begins with a list of learning objectives that present an overall picture of chapter content and help you understand what you should learn. Definitions are highlighted and boxed as they are introduced. Each chapter ends with a summary and review questions. Appearing throughout the text are Focus on Research and Focus on Application boxes, which present four types of research studies:




1.
 Analytical—an evaluation of available information in a review




2.
 Descriptive—a presentation of some variable (such as heart rate or blood lactate) or population (such as children or highly trained endurance athletes)




3.
 Experimental—a design in which treatments have been manipulated to determine their effects on selected variables




4.
 Quasi-experimental—designs such as used in epidemiology that study the frequency, distribution, and risk of disease among population subgroups in real-world setting

s




Focus on Research boxes present classic, illustrative, or cutting-edge research findings. Focus on Application boxes show how research may be used in practical contexts. Some of each type of focus box have been designated as Clinically Relevant.




Clinically Relevant boxes present information, situations, or case studies related to clinical experiences students of exercise physiology often have. These include selected topics in athletic training, cardiac or other rehabilitation, coaching, personal training, physical therapy, and/or teaching. An additional feature is the Check Your Comprehension box. The Check Your Comprehension boxes are problems for you to complete. Occasionally the Check Your Comprehension boxes will be case studies. Answers to these problems are presented in Appendix C. When appropriate, calculations are worked out in examples. The appendices and endpapers provide supplemental information. For example, Appendix A contains a listing of the basic physical quantities, units of measurement, and conversions within the Système International

 d’Unités (SI or metric system of measurement commonly used in scientific work) and between the metric and English measurement systems. In the front of the book, you will find a list of the symbols and abbreviations used throughout the book, along with their full names. You may need to refer to these appendices/endpapers frequently if these symbols and measurement units are new to you.




Exercise physiology is a dynamic area of study with many practical implications. Over the next few months, you will gain an appreciation for the tremendous range in which the human body can function. At the same time, you will become better prepared as a professional to carry out your responsibilities in your particular chosen field. Along the way, you will probably also learn things about yourself. Enjoy the voyage.





The Exercise Response




Let’s begin with some definitions and concepts required for understanding all the units to come. Exercise
 is a single acute bout of bodily exertion or muscular activity that requires an expenditure of energy above resting level and that in most, but not all, cases results in voluntary movement. Exercise sessions are typically planned and structured to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. The term physical activity
, in contrast, generally connotes movement in which the goal (often to sustain daily living or recreation) is different from that of exercise but which also requires the expenditure of energy and often provides health benefits. For example, walking to school or work is physical activity, while walking around a track at a predetermined heart rate is exercise. Exercise is sometimes considered a subset of physical activity with a more specific focus (Caspersen et al., 1985
). From a physiological standpoint, both involve the process of muscle action/energy expenditure and bring about changes (acute and chronic). Therefore, the terms exercise and physical activity are often used interchangeably in this textbook. Where the amount of exercise can actually be measured, the terms workload or work rate may be used as well.



Homeostasis
 is the state of dynamic equilibrium (balance) of the body’s internal environment. Exercise disrupts homeostasis, causing changes that represent the body’s response to exercise. An
 exercise response
 is the pattern of change in physiological variables during a single acute bout of physical exertion. A physiological
 variable
 is any measurable bodily function that changes or
 varies
 under different circumstances. For example, heart rate is a variable with which you are undoubtedly already familiar. You probably also know that heart rate increases during exercise. However, to state simply that heart rate increases during exercise does not describe the full pattern of the response. For example, the heart rate response to a 400-m sprint is different from the heart rate response to a 50-mi bike ride. To fully understand the response of heart rate or any other variable, we need more information about the exercise itself. Three factors are considered when determining the acute response to exercise:




1.
 The exercise modality (or mode)




2.
 The exercise intensity




3.
 The exercise duration



Exercise Modality



Exercise modality
 (or mode
) means the type of activity or the particular sport. For example, rowing has a very different effect on the cardiovascular-respiratory system than does football. Modalities are often classified by the type of energy demand (aerobic or anaerobic), the major muscle action (continuous and rhythmical, dynamic resistance, or static), or a combination of the energy system and muscle action. Walking, cycling, and swimming are examples of continuous, rhythmical aerobic activities; jumping, sprinting, and weight lifting are anaerobic and/or dynamic resistance activities. To determine the effects of exercise on a particular variable, you must first know what type of exercise is being performed.







Exercise
 A single acute bout of bodily exertion or muscular activity that requires an expenditure of energy above resting level and that in most, but not all, cases results in voluntary movement.







Homeostasis
 The state of dynamic equilibrium (balance) of the internal environment of the body.







Exercise Response
 The pattern of homeostatic disruption or change in physiological variables during a single acute bout of physical exertion.







Exercise Modality or Mode
 The type of activity or sport, usually classified by energy demand or type of muscle action.







Maximal (max) Exercise
 The highest intensity, greatest load, or longest duration exercise of which an individual is capable.







Absolute Submaximal Workload
 A set exercise load performed at any intensity from just above resting to just below maximum.







Relative Submaximal Workload
 A workload above resting but below maximum that is prorated to each individual; typically set as some percentage of maximum.







Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC)
 The maximal force that the muscle can exert.







1-RM
 The maximal weight that an individual can lift once during a dynamic resistance exercise.






Exercise Intensity


Exercise intensity is most easily described as maximal or submaximal. Maximal (max) exercise
 is straightforward; it simply refers to the highest intensity, greatest load, or longest duration an individual is capable of doing. Motivation plays a large part in the achievement of maximal levels of exercise. Most maximal values are reached at the end point of an incremental exercise test to maximum
; that is, the exercise task begins at a level the individual is comfortable with and gradually increases until he or she can do no more. The values of the physiological variables measured at this time are labeled as “max”; for example, maximum heart rate is symbolized as HRmax.



Submaximal exercise
 may be described in one of two ways. The first involves a
 set load
, which is a load that is known or is assumed to be below an individual’s maximum. This load may be established by some physiological variable, such as working at a specific heart rate (perhaps

 150 b·min
−1
), at a specific work rate (e.g., 600 kgm·min
−1
 on a cycle ergometer), or for a given distance (perhaps a 1-mi run). Such a load is called an
 absolute workload
. If an absolute workload is used, and the individuals being tested vary in fitness, then some individuals will be challenged more than others. Generally, those who are more fit in terms of the component being tested will be less challenged and so will score better than those who are less fit and more challenged. For example, suppose the exercise task is to lift 80 lb in a bench press as many times as possible, as in the YMCA bench press endurance test for males. As illustrated in
 
Table 1.1

, if the individuals tested were able to lift a maximum of 160, 100, and 80 lb once, respectively, it would be anticipated that the first individual could do more repetitions of the 80-lb lift than anyone else. Similarly, the second individual would be expected to do more repetitions than the third, and the third individual would be expected to do only one repetition. In this case, the load is not submaximal for all the individuals, because Terry can lift the weight only one time (making it a maximal lift for Terry). Nonetheless, the use of an absolute load allows for the ranking of individuals based on the results of a single exercise test and is therefore often used in physical fitness screenings or tests.




TABLE 1.1
 Absolute and Relative Submaximal Workloads







The second way to describe submaximal exercise is as a percentage of an individual’s maximum. A load may be set at a percentage of the person’s maximal heart rate, maximal ability to use oxygen, or maximal workload. This value is called a
 relative workload
 because it is prorated or relative to each individual. All individuals are therefore expected to be equally challenged by the same percentage of their maximal task. This should allow the same amount of time or number of repetitions to be completed by most, if not all, individuals. For example, for the individuals described in
 
Table 1.1

, suppose that the task now is to lift 75% of each one’s maximal load as many times as possible. The individuals will be lifting 120, 75, and 60 lb, respectively. If all three are equally motivated, they should all be able to perform the same total number of repetitions. Relative workloads are occasionally used in physical fitness testing. They are more frequently used to describe exercises that are light, moderate, or heavy in intensity or to prescribe exercise guidelines.




There is no universal agreement about what exactly constitutes light, moderate, or heavy intensity. In general, this book uses the following classifications:




1.
 Low or light: ≤54% of maximum




2.
 Moderate: 55–69% of maximum




3.
 Hard or heavy: 70–89% of maximum




4.
 Very hard or very heavy:90–99% of maximum




5.
 Maximal: 100% of maximum




6.
 Supramaximal: >100% of maximum




Maximum
 is defined variously in terms of workload or work rate, heart rate, oxygen consumption, weight lifted for a specific number of repetitions, or force exerted in a voluntary contraction. Specific studies may use percentages and definitions of maximum that vary slightly.



Exercise Duration


Exercise duration is simply a description of the length of time the muscular action continues. Duration may be as short as 1–3 seconds for an explosive action, such as a jump, or as long as 12 hours for a full triathlon (3.2-km [2-mi] swim, 160-km [100-mi] bicycle ride, and 42.2-km [26.2-mi] run). In general, the shorter the duration, the higher the intensity that can be used. Conversely, the longer the duration, the lower the intensity that can be sustained. Thus, the amount of homeostatic disruption depends on both the duration and intensity of the exercise.


Exercise Categories


This textbook combines the descriptors of exercise modality, intensity, and duration into six primary categories of exercise. Where sufficient information is available, the exercise response patterns for each are described and discussed:



1.
 Short-term, light to moderate submaximal aerobic exercise.
 Exercises of this type are rhythmical and continuous in nature and utilize aerobic energy. They are performed at a constant workload for 10–15 minutes at approximately 30–69% of maximal work capacity.




2.
 Long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise.
 Exercises in this category also utilize rhythmical

 and continuous muscle action. Although predominantly aerobic, anaerobic energy utilization may be involved. The duration is generally between 30 minutes and 4 hours at constant workload intensities ranging from 55 to 89% of maximum.




3.
 Incremental aerobic exercise to maximum
. Incremental exercises start at light loads and continue by a predetermined sequence of progressively increasing workloads to an intensity that the exerciser cannot sustain or increase further. This point becomes the maximum (100%). The early stages are generally light and aerobic, but as the exercise bout continues, anaerobic energy involvement becomes significant. Each workload/work rate is called a stage, and each stage may last from 1 to 10 minutes, although 3 minutes is most common. Incremental exercise bouts typically last between 5 and 20 minutes for the total duration.




4.
 Static exercise.
 Static exercises involve muscle contractions that produce an increase in muscle tension and energy expenditure but do not result in meaningful movement. Static contractions are measured as some percentage of the muscle’s
 maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)
, the maximal force that the muscle can exert. The intent is for the workload to remain constant, but fatigue sometimes makes that impossible. The duration is inversely related to the percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) that is being held but generally ranges from 2 to 10 minutes.




5.
 Dynamic resistance exercise
. These exercises utilize muscle contractions that exert sufficient force to overcome the presented resistance, so that movement occurs, as in weight lifting. Energy is supplied by both aerobic and anaerobic processes, but anaerobic is dominant. The workload is constant and is based on some percentage of the maximal weight the individual can lift
 (1-RM)
 or a resistance that can be lifted for a specified number of times. The number of repetitions, not time, is the measure of duration.




6.
 Very-short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise
. Activities of this type last from a few seconds to approximately 3 minutes. They depend on high-power anaerobic energy and are often supramaximal.

Exercise Response Patterns


Throughout the textbook, the exercise response patterns for the six categories of exercise are described verbally and depicted graphically. For ease of recognition, consistent background colors and icons represent each category of exercise (Table 1.2
). Figure 1.3
 presents six of the most frequent graphic patterns resulting from a constant workload/work rate, that is, all of the exercise categories except incremental exercise to maximum and very-short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise. Frequent incremental exercise patterns are depicted in Figure 1.4
. The verbal descriptors used throughout the book are included on these graphs and in the following paragraphs. Note that the y-axis can be any variable that is measured with its appropriate unit of measurement. Examples are heart rate (b·min−1
), blood pressure (mmHg), and oxygen consumption (mL·kg·min−1
). Only specific graphic patterns are applicable to any given variable. These combinations of pattern and variable are
 described in the exercise response sections in each unit. Although not indicated in the figure, curvilinear changes can also be described as exponential—either positive or negative. For each exercise response, the baseline, or starting point against which the changes are compared, is the variable’s resting value. Your goal here is to become familiar with the graphic patterns and the terminology used to describe each.



TABLE 1.2
 Color and Icon Interpretation for Exercise Response Patterns













FIGURE 1.3
 Graphic Patterns and Verbal Descriptors for Constant Workload/Work Rate Exercise Responses.












FIGURE 1.4
 Graphic Patterns and Verbal Descriptors for Incremental Workload/Work Rate Exercise Responses.






The patterns showing an initial increase or decrease with a plateau at steady state (

Figure 1.3A

 and
 
B

) are the most common responses to short-term, light to moderate submaximal aerobic exercise. Patterns that include a drift seen as the gradual curvilinear increase or decrease from a plateau despite no change in the external workload (

Figure 1.3C

 and
 
D

), typically result from long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise. Another form of gradual increase, despite no change in the external workload (

Figure 1.3E

), is frequently seen during dynamic resistance exercise as a sawtooth pattern resulting from the sequential lifting and lowering of the weight. Finally, some categories of exercise may show a smooth, gradual increase (the straight rising line of
 
Figure 1.3E

). Minimal change during exercise with a rebound rise in recovery is almost exclusively a static exercise response (

Figure 1.3F

).




As the title of
 
Figure 1.4

 indicates, all of these patterns of response routinely result from incremental exercise to maximum. Panel
 1.4F
 shows two versions of the U-shaped pattern. You may see either a complete or truncated (shortened) U, either upright or inverted. No specific patterns are shown for very-short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise, because these tend to be either abrupt rectilinear or curvilinear increases or decreases.



Exercise Response Interpretation


When interpreting the response of variables to any of the exercise categories, keep four factors in mind:



1.
 Characteristics of the exerciser




2.
 Appropriateness of the selected exercise




3.
 Accuracy of the selected exercise




4.
 Environmental and experimental conditions



Characteristics of the Exerciser


Certain characteristics of the exerciser can affect the magnitude of the exercise response. The basic pattern of the response is similar, but the magnitude of the response may vary with the individual’s sex, age (child/adolescent, adult, older adult), and/or physiological status, such as health and training level. Where possible, these differences will be pointed out. See the Focus on Research Box for an example.


Appropriateness of the Selected Exercise


The exercise test used should match the physiological system or physical fitness component one is evaluating. For example, you cannot determine cardiovascular endurance using dynamic resistance exercise. However, if the goal is to determine how selected cardiovascular variables respond to dynamic resistance exercise, then, obviously, that is the type of exercise that must be used
.



The modality used within the exercise category should also match the intended outcome. For example, if the goal is to demonstrate changes in cardiovascular-respiratory fitness for individuals training on a stationary cycle, then an incremental aerobic exercise to maximum test should be conducted on a cycle ergometer, not a treadmill or other piece of equipment.






FOCUS ON RESEARCH
The Effects of Age, Sex, and Physical Training on the Response to Exercise




Exercise professionals and exercise participants have long been interested in how personal characteristics influence the body’s response to exercise. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of age, sex, and physical training on cardiovascular responses to exercise. They separated 110 healthy subjects into eight groups based on three variables: age (young [mid 20s] or old [mid 60s]), sex (male or female), and physical training (trained or untrained). The table below identifies the eight groups based on these three subject characteristics.











Results of this study are shown in the figure at the right, which depicts for each group the systolic blood pressure responses to incremental treadmill tests to maximum. These data reveal the following:






1.
 Systolic blood pressure response to incremental exercise to maximum was significantly greater in older persons than in younger persons. This is true for males and females regardless of training status.




2.
 Maximal systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in trained females than in untrained females.






Although the authors investigated many variables, we describe only systolic blood pressure because the purpose here is only to demonstrate how characteristics of the exerciser affect exercise response.

Accuracy of the Selected Exercise Test


The most accurate tests are called criterion tests
. They represent a standard against which other tests are evaluated. Most criterion tests are laboratory tests
—precise, direct measurements of physiological function that usually involve monitoring, collection, and analysis of expired air, blood, or electrical signals. Typically, these require expensive equipment and trained technicians. Not all laboratory tests, however, are criterion tests.



Field tests
 can be conducted almost anywhere, such as a school gymnasium, playing field, or health club. Field tests are often performance based and estimate the values measured by the criterion test. The mile run is a field test used to assess cardiovascular-respiratory fitness, which is more directly and accurately measured by the criterion test of maximal oxygen consumption (


). Both laboratory and field tests are discussed in this text.








Criterion Test
 The most accurate tests for any given variable; the measurement standard against which other tests are judged.







Laboratory Test
 Precise, direct measurement of physiological functions for the assessment of exercise responses or training adaptations; usually involves monitoring, collection, and analysis of expired air, blood, or electrical signals.







Field Test
 A performance-based test that can be conducted anywhere and that estimates the values measured by the criterion test.







Training
 A consistent or chronic progression of exercise sessions designed to improve physiological function for better health or sport performance.






Environmental and Experimental Conditions


Many physiological variables are affected by environmental conditions, most notably temperature, relative humidity (RH), and barometric pressure. Normal responses typically occur at neutral conditions (~20–29°C [68–84°F], 50% RH, and 630–760 mmHg, respectively). Likewise, when a response to exercise is described, it is assumed that the exerciser had adequate sleep, was not ill, had not recently eaten or exercised, and was not taking any prescription or nonprescription drugs or supplements that could affect the results. If any of these assumed conditions is not met, the expected exercise response might not occur.




Training





Training
 is a consistent or chronic progression of exercise sessions designed to improve physiological function for better health or sport performance. The two main goals for exercise training are (1) health-related physical fitness and (2) sport-specific physical fitness (sometimes called athletic fitness or sport-related physical fitness)
.


Health-Related Versus Sport-Specific Physical Fitness


In this textbook, the phrase health-related physical fitness
 refers to that portion of physical fitness directed toward the prevention of or rehabilitation from disease, the development of a high level of functional capacity for the necessary and discretionary tasks of life, and the maintenance or enhancement of physiological functions in biological systems that are not involved in performance but are influenced by habitual activity. The individual’s goal may be to participate minimally in an activity to achieve some health benefit before disease occurs. The goal may be to participate in a substantial amount of exercise to improve or maintain a high level of physical fitness. Or a disabled individual’s goal may be to participate in an activity to recover and/or attain the maximal function possible. All goals should include avoiding injury during the process.



Three components of health-related physical fitness are generally recognized: cardiovascular-respiratory endurance (aerobic power), body composition, and muscular fitness (strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility) (

American College of Sports Medicine, 2014

;

 
Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 2004

;
 
The Cooper Institute, 2010

).
 
Figure 1.5

 (inner circle) shows that these components form the core of physical fitness. However, the Committee on Fitness Measures and Health Outcomes in Youth, tasked with recommending items “… for assessment of youth fitness components that are associated with health outcomes… suitable for use in a national survey of youth fitness” (

, p. 3) modified the definition of musculoskeletal fitness to exclude flexibility and include muscular power. Whether flexibility will be replaced in the core of health-related physical fitness remains to be seen (

Plowman, 2014

). In the meantime, both flexibility and power are stripped in
 
Figure 1.5

 to indicate that both may be important health-related components.










FIGURE 1.5
 Physical Fitness.
 Physical fitness consists of health-related physical fitness (inner circle) and sport-specific physical fitness (outer circle). Health-related physical fitness is composed of components representing cardiovascular-respiratory endurance, metabolism, and muscular fitness (strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and/or power). Sport-specific physical fitness builds on health-related physical fitness and adds motor attributes (such as agility, balance, and power) and anaerobic power and capacity, as needed.





The relationships between each of these fitness components and
 hypokinetic disease
 are described in appropriate later units. Hypokinetic diseases are diseases caused by and/or associated with a lack of physical activity. Health-related physical fitness is important for everyone.




Sport-specific physical fitness
 has a more narrow focus; it is that portion of physical fitness directed toward optimizing athletic performance.
 
Figure 1.5

 shows that sport-specific (athletic) fitness (outer circle) expands from the core of health-related physical fitness. Higher levels of cardiovascular-respiratory endurance and anaerobic power and capacity are generally needed for successful performance. Body composition values may be more specific than health levels in order to optimize performance. The muscular fitness attributes of power, balance, and flexibility are frequently more specific in certain athletic performances than for health.








Health-Related Physical Fitness
 That portion of physical fitness directed toward the prevention of or rehabilitation from disease, the development of a high level of functional capacity for the necessary and discretionary tasks of life, and the maintenance or enhancement of physiological functions in biological systems that are not involved in performance but are influenced by habitual activity.







Hypokinetic Diseases
 Diseases caused by and/or associated with lack of physical activity.








Sport-Specific Physical Fitness
 That portion of physical fitness directed toward optimizing athletic performance.








To determine the importance of each component of fitness and develop a sport-related fitness program, you first analyze the specific sport’s physiological demands. Then the athlete is evaluated in terms of those requirements. These elements allow for a specifically designed, individualized program. This program should:







Work-specific musculature while achieving a balance between agonistic and antagonistic muscle groups






Incorporate all motor fitness attributes that are needed






Use the muscles in the biomechanical patterns of the sport






Match the cardiovascular and metabolic energy requirements of the sport






Attend realistically to body composition issues






The demands of the sport will not change to accommodate the athlete. The athlete must be the one to meet the demands of the sport to be successful.



Putting all of these elements together,
 physical fitness
 may be defined as a physiological state of well-being that provides the foundation for the tasks of daily living, a degree of protection against hypokinetic disease, and a basis for participation in sport (

American Alliance for Health, 1988

). It is a product, the result of the process of doing physical activity/exercise.



Dose-Response Relationships


Major questions in exercise physiology revolve around “how much exercise/activity is enough?” and “what is the relationship between specific amounts of exercise/activity or physical fitness levels and the benefits achieved?” To the exercise scientist, these are what are called dose-response relationship questions. A dose-response relationship
 describes how a change in one variable is associated with a corresponding change in another variable. In this context, the training dose refers to the characteristics of the training program, that is, the type, intensity, frequency, duration, and/or volume of the exercise program or physical activity undertaken by the individual or group. The response means the changes that occur when a specific volume or dose of exercise/physical activity is performed. Thus, for physical activity and health, dose-response describes the health-related changes obtained for the particular level of physical activity performed. Likewise, for physical fitness and health, the dose-response describes the health-related changes that occur with experimentally documented changes or levels of fitness (Haskell, 2007
). These experimentally derived relationships can be graphed and are often called curves. Although it is clear, for example, that exercise/physical activity reduces the risk of many diseases and improves cardiovascular function, it is far less clear what the minimal dose of physical activity may be to acquire risk reduction or how much additional activity/fitness is needed to confer additional benefits. The shape of the dose-response curve may vary (large benefit for minimal increase, small benefit for large increase, etc.) depending upon the health benefit or physiological variable being measured, and the population that is being studied.

Two examples of dose-response curves are presented in
 
Figure 1.6

 is an actual curve and depicts an inverse or negative dose-response relationship. That is, the higher the weekly energy expenditure, the lower the relative risk of mortality. Panel
 B
 is an example where the curve is implied by the relative heights of the bars in the graph. In contrast to Panel
 A
, this dose-response relationship is a direct or positive one. That is, the higher the amount of daily sitting time, the higher the pro-rated all-cause death rate. Note that the mortality rate varies between those who are active and those who are inactive. However, although lower, even within the active group (defined as participating in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise 5 d·wk
−1
), there is a strong association between sitting and risk of mortality.

Considerable research is currently being done to discern the shapes of the dose-response curves in order

 to clarify exercise/physical activity recommendations for various benefits and populations. Until more dose-response information is available, we can only cite variations for the upper and lower recommendations in order to acknowledge that these guidelines do not represent a threshold below which no benefits are achieved. There is undoubtedly a point of diminishing return, where more exercise is not necessarily better. Conversely, it is also absolutely clear that some activity is always better than no activity. Somewhere between the minimal and maximal doses of exercise/physical activity may be an optimal dose. Such a dose would provide the greatest health benefit for the least amount of time and effort and the least risk of injury (American College of Sports Medicine, 2014;
 
Haskell, 2007

). Similarly, both athletes and coaches would like to know dose-response and optimal levels of training or fitness to maximize performance. Ideally, one dose would also be optimal for all possible desirable health/performance outcomes and all populations. This is highly unlikely, but unknown at this point. As a result, a variety of public health statements on the amount of exercise/physical activity/fitness necessary for obtaining health-related benefits are available. These are discussed in this text, as well as considerations for sport performance in the context of the application of the training principles.



Training Principles


Although there is much we do not know about training, and new training techniques appear often, eight fundamental guidelines are well established and should form the basis for the development of any training program. These training principles
 are defined and briefly explained in the following sections, but the specific details for applying each principle, as well as the anticipated results or adaptations, are discussed in appropriate later units.







Training Principles
 Fundamental guidelines that form the basis for the development of an exercise training program.







Training Volume
 The quantity of training overload calculated as frequency times duration for anaerobic or aerobic continuous exercise or number of sets times number of repetitions for resistance exercise.








1.
 Specificity
. This principle is sometimes called the SAID principle, which stands for “
s
pecific
 a
daptations to
 i
mposed
 d
emands”; that is, what you do is what you get.

When you develop an exercise training program, you first determine the goal. Fitness programs for children and adolescents, for example, differ from those for older adults. Training programs for nonathletes differ from training programs for athletes. Athletic training programs vary by sport, by event, or even by position within the same sport.

Second, you analyze the physiological requirements for meeting the goal. What physiological system is being stressed: the cardiovascular-respiratory, the metabolic, or the neuromuscular-skeletal? What is the major energy system involved? What motor fitness attributes (agility, balance, flexibility, strength, power, muscular endurance) need to be developed? The more closely the training program matches these factors, the greater its chance for success.




2.
 Overload
. Overload is a demand placed on the body greater than that to which it is accustomed. To determine the overload, first evaluate the individual’s critical physiological variables (specificity). Then consider three factors: frequency—the number of training sessions daily or weekly; intensity—the level of work, energy expenditure, or physiological response in relation to the maximum; and duration—the amount of time spent training per session or per day.
 Training volume
 is the quantity or amount of overload (frequency times duration for anaerobic or aerobic continuous exercise or number of sets times number of repetitions for resistance exercise), whereas training intensity represents the quality of overload.




3.
 Rest/Recovery/Adaptation
. Adaptation is the change in physiological function that occurs in response to training. Adaptation occurs during periods of rest, when the body recovers from the acute homeostatic disruptions and/or residual fatigue and, as a result, may compensate to above-baseline levels of physiological functioning. This is sometimes called
 supercompensation
 (

Bompa, 1999

;
 
Freeman, 1996

). It is therefore critical for exercisers to receive sufficient rest between training sessions, after periods of increased training overload, and both before and after competitions. Adaptation allows the individual to either do more work or do the same work with a smaller disruption of baseline values. Keeping records and retesting individuals are generally necessary to determine the degree of adaptation.




4.
 Progression
. Progression is the change in overload in response to adaptation. The best progression occurs in a series of incremental steps (called
 steploading
), in which every third or fourth change is actually a slight decrease in training load (

Bompa, 1999

;
 
Freeman, 1996

). This step-down allows for recovery, which leads to adaptation. Each step should be small, controlled, and flexible. A continuous unbroken increase in training load should be avoided. Complete the Check Your Comprehension 2 box.




5.
 Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility
. Progress is rarely linear, predictable, or consistent. When an individual’s adaptation or performance decreases, retrogression has occurred. If performance levels off, a plateau has been reached. A plateau should be interpreted relative to the training regimen. Too much time spent doing the same type of workout using the same equipment in the same environment

 can lead to a plateau. Either too little or too much competition can lead to a plateau. Plateaus are a normal consequence of a maintenance overload and may also occur normally, even during a well-designed, well-implemented steploading progression. Variety and rest may help the person move beyond a plateau. However, if a plateau continues for some time or if other signs and symptoms appear, then the plateau may be an early warning signal of overreaching or overtraining (

Chapter 22

). Retrogression may also signal overreaching or overtraining. Reversibility is the reversal of achieved physiological adaptations that occurs after training stops (detraining).




6.
 Maintenance
. Maintenance is sustaining an achieved adaptation with the most efficient use of time and effort. At this point, the individual has reached an acceptable level of physical fitness or training. The amount of time and effort required to maintain this adaptation depends on the physiological systems involved. For example, more time and effort are needed to maintain adaptations in the cardiovascular system than in the neuromuscular system. In general, intensity is the key to maintenance. That is, as long as exercise intensity is maintained, frequency and duration of exercise may decrease without losing positive adaptations.




7.
 Individualization
. Individuals require personalized exercise prescriptions based on their fitness levels and goals. Individuals also adapt differently to the same training program. The same training overload may improve physiological performance in one individual, maintain physiological and performance levels in a second individual, and result in maladaptation and performance decreases in a third. Such differences often result from lifestyle factors, particularly nutritional and sleep habits, stress levels, and substance use (such as tobacco or alcohol). Age, sex, genetics, disease, and the training modality also all affect individual exercise prescriptions and adaptations.




8.
 Warm-Up/Cooldown
. A warm-up prepares the body for activity by elevating the body temperature. Conversely, a cooldown allows for a gradual return to normal body temperature. The best type of warm-up is specific to the activity that will follow and individualized to avoid fatigue.




Another important element beyond the physiological training principles is motivation. Except at a military boot camp, it is very difficult to force anyone to train. Therefore, any training program should also be fun. Intersperse games, variations, and special events with the training, and strive to make normal training sessions as enjoyable as possible.

Mark, a 30-year-old teacher, was disappointed when he ran the local 10-km (6.2 mi) Corn Harvest race in 49:04, which was within seconds of his previous year’s time under similar weather conditions. To prepare for the race, he had been training for the previous 6 months. His training consisted of walking for 30 minutes on the Stairmaster at level 10, 2 days per week; running 3 mi in 25–30 minutes on another 2 days; and swimming or bicycling for 45–60 minutes on a 5th day. He did his runs and cycling with Kristi, a 25-year-old fellow teacher, and let her set the pace. She did not run the race.







Considering all eight training principles, identify three principles that apply here and that Mark may not have followed very well. For each one, make a suggestion as to how he might better apply it to prepare more successfully for the upcoming Turkey Trot 10-km race in 3 months. Check your answers in Appendix C.







Periodization


A training program should be implemented in a pattern that is most beneficial for adaptations. This pattern is called the training cycle or periodization. Periodization
 is a plan for training based on a manipulation of the sport’s fitness components and the training principles. The objective is to peak the athlete’s performance for
 the competitive season or some part of it while managing fatigue and avoiding overtraining (Morgans et al., 2014
; Plisk and Stone, 2003
). In general, periodized training progresses from high-volume, low-intensity training to high-intensity, low-volume training for both endurance and resistance weight training as the program progresses (Plisk and Stone, 2003
). There are a variety of ways of organizing periodization schedules. See the Focus on Application box for an example of a study that tested two variations of periodization in previously untrained female college students. An individual training for health-related physical fitness should also use periodization to build in cycles of harder or easier training, or to emphasize one component or another, to prevent monotony.







Periodization
 Plan for training based on a manipulation of the fitness components with the intent of peaking the athlete for the competitive season or varying health-related fitness training in cycles of harder or easier training.








Figure 1.7

 is an example of how periodization might be arranged for an athlete, in this case a basketball player whose season lasts approximately 4.5 months. This is intended as an example only, because periodization depends on the individual’s situation and abilities. The time frame in our example is for 1 year—presented as 52 weeks (outer circle)—and is divided into four phases or cycles (

Bompa, 1999

;
 
Freeman, 1996

;
 
Kearney, 1996

):










FIGURE 1.7
 Periodization Phases and Overload.
 The annual training plan consists of four phases: the general preparatory phase (which concentrates on developing the health-related physical fitness components), the specific preparatory phase (which emphasizes development of the sport-specific physical fitness components), the competitive phase (which emphasizes maintenance of all the physical fitness components), and the transition phase (which allows rest and recovery from the season but emphasizes cross-training to avoid complete detraining). Overload is rated on a scale of 0 (complete rest) to 10 (maximal) and is shown in the tan boxes on the inner circle
. Three of the five types of macrocycles are illustrated [A (developmental), B (shock), and E (transition)] in the phases where they typically are used. Four of the five types of microcycles are also shown [A (developmental), B (shock), C (competitive), and B and D (regeneration/tapering)] where they are typically used.

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Linear versus Undulating Periodization






Two of the basic periodization models for resistance training are the linear (also known as traditional or stepwise) model and the undulating (also known as the nontraditional, nonlinear, or mixed methods) model. Linear periodization starts with the typical high-volume/low-intensity training and progresses through an emphasis on hypertrophic adaptation (strength-endurance) to basic strength and finally to strength and power thus gradually reversing the emphasis to high-intensity/low-volume training. In undulating training, however, volume and intensity vary on a weekly or daily basis.








Kok et al. (2009)

 compared these two methods in 20 college students when total workload and average training intensity were matched by the end of the training. All participants received four familiarization sessions prior to testing and 3 weeks of pretraining conditioning before baseline testing. The actual training routines are presented in the accompanying table. Note that in the linear training group (LP), the exercise prescription is by phase and varies only in terms of the % of 1-RM (percentage of the maximal amount of weight the individual could lift one time) for each set, whereas for the undulating training group (UP), both the number of repetitions per set and the % 1-RM vary by day.








Results of the training adaptations for the 1-RM bench press (kg) and 1-RM squat (kg) are presented in the accompanying figure. Both groups improved significantly in these two lifts at T2 (week 6), T3 (week 9), and T4 (week 12) tests when compared to the baseline testing at T1 (week 3). Squat jump height and bench press throw, indicators of power (not shown), improved similarly. It was concluded that both programs improved strength and power equally, and therefore, either technique may be used.

General Preparation Phase


The general preparation (off-season) phase should be preceded by a sport-specific fitness evaluation to guide both the general and specific preparation training program. Another evaluation might be conducted before the season if desired, or evaluations might be conducted systematically throughout the year to determine how the individual is responding to training and to make any necessary adjustments. All evaluation testing should be done at the end of a regeneration cycle so that fatigue is not a confounding factor. As the name implies, the general preparation phase (off-season) is a time when total body health-related physical fitness components are emphasized to develop cardiovascular-respiratory endurance (an aerobic base), flexibility, as well as muscular strength, muscular power, and muscular endurance. Any needed changes in body composition should be addressed during this phase (Kibler and Chandler, 1994
). An aerobic base is important for all athletes, even those whose event is primarily anaerobic. A high aerobic capacity allows the individual to work at a higher intensity before accumulating large quantities of lactic acid. A high aerobic capacity also allows the individual to recover faster, which is important in itself and allows for a potentially greater total volume of work during interval sessions (Bompa, 1999
).



The general preparation phases may occupy most of the year for a fitness participant. During this phase, overload progresses by steps in both intensity and volume (frequency times duration/sets times repetitions), with volume typically being relatively more important than intensity (

Bompa, 1999

).



Specific Preparation Phase


During the specific preparation phase (preseason phase), the athlete shifts to exercises for the fitness and physiological components needed to succeed in the intended sport. The training program is very heavy and generally occupies at least 6–8 weeks before the first competition or longer (in the example it is 12 weeks) before league competition. About midway through the specific preparatory phase, intensity may surpass volume in importance. Alternately, this shift to more emphasis on intensity than volume may not occur until the following competitive phase. This varies according to the physiological demands of particular sports and the relative length of the two phases. Sport technical skill training typically increases as the specific preparation phase progresses (Kibler and Chandler, 1994
; Plisk and Stone, 2003
).


Competition Phase


Once the athlete begins the competition phase, the emphasis first shifts to maintaining the sport-specific fitness developed during the preseason. Although both volume and intensity may be maintained or intensity may even increase, heavy work should immediately follow a competition instead of directly preceding one. During the late season, when the most important competitions are usually held (such as conference championships or
 bowl games), the athlete should do only a minimum of training or taper gradually so that he or she is rested without being detrained. An analysis of 27 tapering studies revealed that the optimal taper for maximizing performance consists of 2 weeks during which training volume is exponentially reduced by 41–60% without any modification of either training intensity or frequency (Bosquet et al., 2007
).


Transition Phase


The transition phase begins immediately after the last competition of the year. The athlete should take a couple days of complete rest and then participate in active rest using noncompetitive physical activities outside the primary sport. This type of activity is often called cross-training. In this transition phase, neither training volume
 nor intensity should exceed low levels (Kibler and Chandler, 1994
)
.


Macrocycles


Each periodization phase is typically divided into several types of macrocycles
 that may each vary in length from 2 to 6 weeks (Fry et al., 1992
; Kibler and Chandler, 1994
). It should be noted that some systems use the term macrocycle to indicate the total yearly plan and the term mesocycle to indicate phases that last 2–6 weeks (Plisk and Stone, 2003
). In this text, we will use the definitions as indicated. Each type of cycle aims for an optimal mixture of work and rest. Macrocycles have five basic goals or patterns, described in the following sections. Different types of macrocycles may be used in a single phase of training.



1.
 Developmental macrocycle
.
 
Figure 1.7A

 illustrates a developmental macrocycle typically used in the preparatory stages. It is designed to improve either general or specific fitness attributes, such as strength, progressively. Overloading is achieved by a stepwise progression from low to medium to high by gradually increasing the load for three cycles (e.g., weeks 9, 10, and 11 from week 8), followed in week 12 by a regeneration cycle back to the level of the second load or first increase, week 9. This level then becomes the base for the next loading cycle. This is what is meant by steploading.




2.
 Shock macrocycle
. Shock macrocycles, such as the one illustrated in
 
Figure 1.7B

, are used primarily during the two preparatory phases and are designed to increase training demands suddenly. They should always be followed by an unloading regeneration cycle consisting of a drastically reduced training load.




3.
 Competitive macrocycle
. Competitive macrocycles are based on maintaining physiological fitness while optimizing performance for competitions. Obviously, competitive macrocycles occur during the competitive phase of periodization.




4.
 Tapering or unloading regeneration macrocycle
. Tapering or unloading regeneration macrocycles involve systematic decreases in overload to facilitate a physiological fitness peak or supercompensation (

Bompa, 1999

). As noted, unloading regeneration cycles are used both as breaks between other cycles and as the basis of the active transition phase (

Bompa, 1999

;
 
Freeman, 1996

;
 
Kibler and Chandler, 1994

).




5.
 Transition macrocycles
. Transition or regression macrocycles (

Figure 1.7E

) occur during the transition phase and involve very little overload. Tapering (regeneration) and transition phrases are intended to remove fatigue, emphasize relaxation, and prevent overreaching/overtraining. Some reversal (regression) of conditioning is expected. These phases are just as valuable for the fitness participant as the athlete.



Microcycles


Macrocycles are further divided into microcycles
, each lasting 1 week (Fry et al., 1992
; Kibler and Chandler, 1994
) (Figure 1.7A–D
). Similar to macrocycles, microcycles can be developmental, shock, competitive or maintenance, tapering or unloading regeneration, or transition or regression. Different types of microcycles may also be used in a single phase or macrocycle. For example, Figure 1.7B
 illustrates a shock macrocycle that contains both shock microcycles and a regeneration (unloading) microcycle. Likewise, Figure 1.7C
 and D
 depict a tapering microcycle and a competitive microcycle in the competition phase. Microcycles are further subdivided into specific daily workouts or lesson plans designed by the coach for the athlete. Depending on the athlete’s maturity and experience and the level of competition, a training day may entail one, two, or three workouts (Bompa, 1999
).



Where possible throughout this text, periodization will be considered in the application of the training principles.



Training Adaptations


Training (Figure 1.8
) brings about physical and physiological changes typically labeled adaptations. Training adaptations
 are physiological changes or adjustments resulting from an exercise training program that promote optimal functioning. Whereas exercise responses (those physiological changes that occur during a single acute exercise bout) use resting values as the baseline (e.g., the pattern of heart rate rise to min 30 of a long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise is compared to the resting heart rate), training adaptations are evaluated against the same condition prior to training. That is, posttraining values for the variable of interest (on the y-axis) at rest are compared to pretraining values of that variable at rest (e.g., is the resting systolic blood pressure higher, lower, or the same after training as the resting value was before?). Posttraining values in the variable of interest during submaximal exercise are compared to pretraining values under the same submaximal exercise conditions. Similarly, posttraining maximal values of the
 variable of interest can be compared to pretraining maximal values. Time or exercise intensity, as always, is on the x-axis for the line graphs. Training adaptations may be presented as exercise response patterns using a line graph where T = trained state and UT = untrained state (Figure 1.9A
–C
) or simply as specific values using a bar graph where T1 (Time 1) indicates the pretraining value and T2 (Time 2) indicates the posttraining value (Figure 1.9D
).









FIGURE 1.8
 Training to Improve Physiological Function and Skill for Improved Performance.












FIGURE 1.9
 Graphic Patterns Depicting Training Adaptations.

 Training adaptations are evaluated by comparing variables of interest before and after the training program during the same condition; that is, at rest, during submaximal exercise, or at maximal exercise. Before and after are depicted either by separate lines for untrained (UT) or trained (T) individuals or by the designations T1 and T2 indicating the first test and second test separated by the training program. Compared with the untrained state, training may cause no change, an increase, or a decrease in the measured variable.









Training Adaptations
 Physiological changes or adjustments resulting from an exercise training program that promote optimal functioning.







Training results in adaptations that are an increase, a decrease, or unchanged in relation to the untrained state. For example, in
 
Figure 1.9A

, there is no difference in the values of this variable between the trained and untrained individuals either at rest or during submaximal exercise. However, the trained group increased at maximum over the untrained. In
 
Figure 1.9B

, training resulted in an increase at rest, during submaximal exercise, and at maximum.
 
Figure 1.9C

 and
 
D

 presents the same adaptations in both a line graph and a bar graph to show how each might look. Both graphs indicate that training resulted in a decrease at rest and submaximal work, but no change at maximum.




Training adaptations at rest show more variation than either submaximal or maximal changes. In general, if the exercise test is an absolute submaximal test, the physiological responses will probably be decreased after training. For example, heart rate at a work rate of 600 kgm·min
−1
 might be 135 b·min
−1
 for an individual before training but 128 b·min
−1
 after training. If the exercise test is a relative submaximal test, the physiological responses will probably show no change after training. That is, if an individual were to cycle at 75%
 

 both before and after training, it would be assumed that the
 

, and therefore the amount of external work done at 75%, had increased because of the training. However, both the before and after training heart rate could be 142 b·min
−1
. If the comparison is made at maximal effort, most physiological responses will increase, such as the
 

 in the preceding absolute example. These results do not hold for all variables but are general patterns.




The predominant way of looking at training adaptations (as opposed to during exercise responses) is that not only do they result from the chronic application of exercise but also they themselves represent
 chronic changes
. Such adaptations become greater with harder training, are thought to exist as long as the training continues, and gradually return to baseline values when training stops (detraining). In reality, however, not all training adaptations follow this standard pattern. Some benefits occur only immediately after the exercise session. These effects are called
 last-bout effects
 and should not be confused with the exercise response. For example, a last-bout effect can occur with blood pressure levels. The acute response of blood pressure to continuous aerobic endurance exercise is an increase in systolic blood pressure but little or no change in diastolic blood pressure. In the recovery period after exercise, systolic blood pressure decreases. In normal individuals, the decrease is back to the exerciser’s normal resting value in a matter of minutes. In individuals with high blood pressure, this postexercise decrease can result in values below their abnormally high resting level for up to 3 hours after exercise. After 3 hours, the high resting values return. In some cases, the last-bout effect can be augmented. That is, assuming the individual participates

 in a training program of sufficient frequency, intensity, and duration for a period of one to several weeks, the positive change occurring after each exercise bout may be increased. In the example just referred to, the decrease in systolic blood pressure might be 2 mmHg initially, but after several weeks, the postexercise blood pressure decrease might be 6 mmHg for several hours. However, the adjustments that can occur are finite. Once the level of the
 augmented last-bout effect
 is reached, no further increase in training will bring about additional benefit (

Haskell, 1994

). This may be the reason why frequency and consistency are so important in overload for adaptation. Overall, then, the adaptations that result from training can occur on three levels:




1.
 A chronic change




2.
 A last-bout effect




3.
 An augmented last-bout effect




The majority of the training adaptations are dealt with in this book as if they are chronic changes unless otherwise specified.





Detraining




As noted in the retrogression/plateau/reversibility training principle, training adaptations are reversible. This is called detraining. Detraining
 is the partial or complete loss of training-induced adaptations as a result of a training reduction or cessation. Detraining may occur due to a lack of compliance with an exercise training program, injury, illness, or a planned periodization transition phase. Detraining should not occur during the tapering/unloading phases or cycles.







Detraining
 The partial or complete loss of training-induced adaptations as a result of a training reduction or cessation.







Stress
 The state manifested by the specific syndrome that consists of all the nonspecifically induced changes within a biological system; a disruption in body homeostasis and all attempts by the body to regain homeostasis.








The magnitude of the reversal of physiological adaptations depends on the training status of the individual when the training is decreased or ceased, the degree of reduction in the training (minimal to complete), which element of training overload is impacted most (frequency, intensity, or duration), and how long the training is reduced or suspended.




Just as all physiological variables do not adapt at the same rate (days vs. months), so all physiological variables do not reverse at the same rate. Unfortunately, less information is available about detraining than training. The timeline for the loss/reversal of adaptation for all variables and in all populations is unknown. Compounding this issue, it is often difficult to distinguish among changes resulting from illness, normal aging, and detraining.

Exercise and Training as Stressors




Exercise and training are often considered only in a positive manner, but both acute exercise and chronic training are stressors.


Selye’s Theory of Stress


A stressor is any activity, event, or impingement that causes stress. Stress
 is defined most simply as a disruption in body homeostasis and all attempts by the body to regain homeostasis. Selye defines stress more precisely as “the state manifested by a specific syndrome that consists of all the nonspecifically induced changes within a biological system.” The biological system here is the human body. The specific syndrome is the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), a step-by-step description of the bodily reactions to a stressor. It consists of three major stages (Selye, 1956
):



1.
 The Alarm-Reaction: shock and countershock




2.
 The Stage of Resistance




3.
 The Stage of Exhaustion




In the
 Alarm-Reaction stage
, the body responds to a stressor with a disruption of homeostasis (shock). It immediately attempts to regain homeostasis (countershock). If the body can adjust, the response is mild and advantageous to the organism; the
 Stage of Resistance
 or adaptation ensues. If the stress becomes chronic or the acquired adaptation is lost, the body enters the
 Stage of Exhaustion
. At this point, the nonspecifically induced changes, which are apparent during the Alarm-Reaction but disappear during the Stage of Resistance, become paramount. These changes are labeled the triad of symptoms and include enlargement of the adrenal glands, shrinkage of thymus and lymphatic tissue, and bleeding ulcers of the digestive tract. Specifically induced changes directly related to the stressor may also occur; for example, if the stressor is cold (shock), the body may shiver to produce heat (countershock). Ultimate exhaustion is death (

Selye, 1956

).



Selye’s Theory of Stress Applied to Exercise and Training


In the context of Selye’s theory of stress, the pattern of responses exhibited by physiological variables during a single bout of exercise results directly from the disruption of homeostasis. This is the shock phase of the Alarm-Reaction stage. For many physiological processes (respiration, circulation, energy production, and so forth), the initial response is an elevation in function. The degree of elevation and constancy of this elevation depends on the intensity and duration of the exercise. Appropriate changes in physiological function begin in the countershock phase of the Alarm-Reaction and stabilize in the Stage of Resistance if the same exercise intensity is maintained for at least 1–3 minutes. The Stage of Exhaustion that results from a single bout of exercise, even incremental exercise to maximum, is typically some degree of fatigue or reduced capacity to respond to stimulation, accompanied
 by a feeling of tiredness. This fatigue is temporary and readily reversed with proper rest and nutrition.



Training programs are made up of a series of acute bouts of exercise organized in such a way as to provide an overload that puts the body into the Alarm-Reaction stage followed by recovery processes that not only restore homeostasis but also encourage supercompensation or adaptation (

Kenttä and Hassmén, 1998

;
 
Kuipers, 1998

;
 
O’Toole, 1998

). This can be manifested by altered homeostatic levels at rest, dampened homeostatic disruptions to absolute submaximal exercise loads, and/or enhanced maximal performances or physiological responses. When these adaptations occur, the body has achieved a Stage of Resistance.
 
Table 1.3

 shows how the training principles previously introduced operate in the three stages of Selye’s general adaptation syndrome.




TABLE 1.3
 Selye’s Theory of Stress Applied to Exercise Physiology









*
The cycle of adaptation and progression occurs repeatedly during a training program.



†
If overreaching is planned and recovery is sufficient, positive adaptation results; if overreaching is accompanied by insufficient recovery and additional overload, overtraining will result.





The goal of a training program is to alternate the exerciser between Stages I and II and to avoid time in Stage III where recovery is not possible in a reasonable time. This process primarily proceeds by the cyclical interaction (shown by the arrows in
 
Table 1.3

) between adaptation (changes that occur in response to an overload) and progression (change in overload in response to adaptation). Each progression of the overload should allow for adaptation. However, this is not always accomplished.



Training Adaptation and Maladaptation


The results of exercise training can be positive or negative depending on how the stressors are applied. Training is related to fitness goals and athletic performance on a continuum that is best described as an inverted U (Figure 1.10
) (Fry et al., 1991
; Kuipers, 1998
; Rowbottom et al., 1998
). At one end of the continuum are individuals who are undertrained and whose fitness level and performance abilities are determined by genetics, disease, and nonexercise lifestyle choices. Individuals whose training programs lack sufficient volume, intensity, or progression for either improvement or maintenance of fitness or performance are also undertrained. The goal of optimal periodized training is the attainment of peak fitness and/or performance. However, if the training overload is too much or improperly applied, then maladaptation
 may occur.









FIGURE 1.10
 Training Status and Performance.






The first step toward maladaptation may be
 overreaching (OR)
, a short-term decrement in performance capacity that is easily recovered from and generally lasts only a few days to 2 weeks. Overreaching may result from planned shock microcycles, as described in the periodization section, or result inadvertently from too much stress and too little planned recovery (

Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Fry and Kraemer, 1997

;
 
Kuipers, 1998

). If overreaching is planned and recovery is sufficient, positive adaptation and improved performance, sometimes called
 supercompensation
, result. If, however, overreaching is left unchecked or the individual or coach interprets the decrement in performance as an indication that more work must be done, overreaching may develop into overtraining. Overtraining, more properly called the
 overtraining syndrome (OTS)
 (or staleness), is a state of chronic decrement in performance and ability to train, in which restoration may take several

 weeks, months, or even years (

Armstrong and vanHeest, 2002

;
 
Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Fry and Kraemer, 1997

;
 
Kreider et al., 1998

). The neuroendocrine-immune basis of all stress responses and the maladaptations of overreaching and the overtraining syndrome are discussed in the neuroendocrine-immune unit of this text.








Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)
 A state of chronic decrement in performance and ability to train, in which restoration may take several weeks, months, or even years.







The stress theory enhances our understanding of exercise, exercise training, and physical fitness. As emphasized previously, both exercise and exercise training are stressors. Thus, from the standpoint of stress theory, physical fitness may be defined as achieved adaptation to the stress imposed by muscular exercise. It results as an adaptation from a properly applied training program, is usually exhibited in response to an acute exercise task, and implies avoidance of the OTS.




Strictly speaking, according to stress theory, supercompensation occurs because of a cause-effect relationship between fatigue and fitness. Recent periodization literature emphasizes the opposing effects of fitness and fatigue and is guided by the attempt to maximize the fitness responses to training stimuli while minimizing fatigue. Because fatigue is a natural consequence of training stress and because adaptations are manifested during recovery periods, fatigue management tactics become extremely important (

Brown and Greenwood, 2005

;
 
Plisk and Stone, 2003

).





Summary





1.
 This chapter presents the general organization of the text and provides background information that will help you interpret and understand the information presented in later chapters.




2.
 This chapter differentiates between exercise responses to a single acute bout of exercise and training adaptations to a program of regular exercise.




3.
 The response to exercise, which is always a disruption in homeostasis, depends on the exercise modality, intensity, and duration. Interpretation of exercise responses must consider characteristics of the exerciser (age, sex, training status), appropriateness of the exercise test used (match between the intended physiological system and outcome), accuracy of the selected exercise (criterion or field test), and environmental and experimental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and subject preparation).




4.
 The baselines against which the exercise-caused disruptions of homeostasis (the exercise response) are compared are normal resting values of the measured variables.




5.
 Health-related physical fitness is composed of components representing cardiovascular-respiratory endurance, metabolism, and muscular fitness (muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and/or muscular power).




6.
 Sport-specific physical fitness builds on health-related physical fitness and adds motor fitness attributes (such as agility, balance, and/or power) and anaerobic power and capacity, as needed.




7.
 Dose-response relationships describe how a change in one variable (such as exercise training, physical activity, or physical fitness level) is associated with a corresponding change in another variable (e.g., training adaptations, health risk factors, or mortality).




8.
 Eight general training principles provide guidance for establishing and applying training programs: specificity, overload, rest/recovery/adaptation, progression, retrogression/plateau/reversibility, maintenance, individualization, and warm-up/cooldown.




9.
 Periodization provides a timeline for the planning of training programs that progresses through four phases or cycles: the general preparatory phase (off-season), the specific preparatory phase (preseason), the competitive phase (in-season), and the transition phase (active rest).




10.
 To prescribe a training program:




a.
 Analyze the physiological demands of the physical fitness program, rehabilitation, or sport goal




b.
 Evaluate the individual relative to the established physiological demands




c.
 Apply the training principles relative to the established physiological demands in periodization cycles that allow for a steploading pattern of varying levels of exercise and rest or recovery.




11.
 Exercise training brings about adaptations in physiological function. Training adaptations are compared to corresponding pretraining conditions (the baseline).




12.
 Training adaptations may occur on at least three levels: a last-bout effect, an augmented last-bout effect, or a chronic change.




13.
 Detraining is the reversal of training adaptations caused by a decrease or cessation of exercise training. It depends upon the training status of the individual, the degree of reduction in the exercise training, which overload component is impacted most, and the length of time training is interrupted. The timeline for detraining is different for different physiological variables

.




14.
 In the context of Selye’s theory of stress, exercise is a stressor that causes a disruption of the body’s homeostasis. During an acute bout of exercise, the body may progress from the Alarm-Reaction stage to the Stages of Resistance and (occasionally) the Stage of Exhaustion. Training programs should be designed to provide an overload that allows adaptation and gradual progression but avoids nonrecoverable time in the Stage of Exhaustion and the Overtraining Syndrome.
