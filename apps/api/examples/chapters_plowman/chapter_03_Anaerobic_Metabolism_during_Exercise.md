Introduction






Chapter 2
 explained how ATP, the ultimate energy source for all human work, is produced by the metabolic pathways. The emphasis there was on the energy substrate (carbohydrate, fat, or protein) utilized as fuel. This chapter and the next look at ATP production and utilization on the basis of the need for oxygen. Anaerobic metabolism does not require oxygen to produce ATP, whereas aerobic metabolism does. Critical to understanding anaerobic and aerobic exercise metabolism is the fact that these processes are not mutually exclusive; that is, anaerobic metabolism and aerobic metabolism are not either/or situations in terms of how ATP is provided. Both systems start simultaneously and work concurrently when additional energy is needed. When describing muscular exercise, the terms aerobic or anaerobic refer to the system predominating at the time.




The Energy Continuum





Figure 3.1
 reviews the three sources of ATP production introduced in Chapter 2
. Figure 3.1A
 describes alactic anaerobic metabolism
, sometimes called the phosphagen
 or ATP-PC system
. Once produced, ATP is stored in the muscle. This amount is relatively small and can provide energy for only 2–3 seconds of maximal effort (Mougios, 2006
). However, another high-energy compound, phosphocreatine (PC), also known as creatine phosphate (CP), can be used to resynthesize ATP from ADP almost instantaneously. The amount of PC stored in muscle is about three times that of ATP (Gollnick and King, 1969
). Muscles differ in the amount of stored PC by fiber type. Muscle fiber types are fully described in Chapter 17
, but briefly, fibers that produce energy predominantly by anaerobic glycolysis are called glycolytic; those that produce energy predominantly aerobically are called oxidative. In terms of contraction speed, muscle fibers are either fast twitch or slow twitch. When contractile and metabolic characteristics are combined, three fiber types are generally described: fast-twitch glycolytic (FG also known as type IIX), fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG also known as type IIA), and slow-twitch oxidative (SO). Fast-twitch fibers have proportionally more PC than ATP compared to SO fibers. Any time the energy demand is increased—whether the activity is simply turning a page of this book, coming out of the blocks for a sprint, or starting out on a long bicycle ride—at least part of the immediate need for energy is supplied by these stored forms (ATP, PC), which must ultimately be replenished. These sources are also used preferentially in high-intensity, very-short-duration activity such as the 50- and 100-m (yd) dashes and snowboard half-pipe. Most resynthesis of ATP from PC takes place in the first 10 seconds of maximal muscle contraction; little, if any, occurs after 20 seconds of
 maximal activity (Gastin, 2001
). This ATP-PC system neither uses oxygen nor produces lactic acid and is thus said to be alactic anaerobic
.

Figure 3.1B

 represents
 anaerobic glycolysis
, also called the
 lactic acid (LA) system
. When the demand for ATP exceeds the capacity of the phosphagen system and the aerobic system (at the initiation of any activity or during high-intensity, short-duration exercise),
 fast
 (anaerobic) glycolysis is used to produce ATP. This is rather like calling in the reserves, for glycolysis can provide the supplemental energy quickly. The rate of ATP production from glycolysis reaches its maximum about 5 seconds after initiation of contraction and is maintained at this rate for several seconds (

Gastin, 2001

). This system predominates in activities such as a 1,500-m speed skating event. Other sport activities with a heavy reliance on the LA system include middle distances (e.g., track 200–800 m, swimming 100 m, slalom, and downhill skiing); gymnastic floor exercise; parallel bars; a round of boxing; and a period of wrestling. The ability to perform the events with speed and power is the benefit. The cost is that the production of lactic acid often exceeds clearance, and lactate accumulates. Because this system does not use oxygen but does result in the production of lactic acid, it is said to be
 lactic anaerobic
.





Figure 3.1C

 shows
 aerobic oxidation
, also termed the
 O
2
 system
. The generation of ATP from
 slow
 (aerobic) glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport–oxidative phosphorylation is constantly in operation at some level. In resting conditions, this system provides basically all of the energy needed. When activity begins or occurs at moderate levels of intensity, oxidation increases quickly and proceeds at a rate that supplies the needed ATP. If the workload is continuously increased, aerobic oxidation proceeds at a correspondingly higher rate until its maximal limit is reached. The highest amount of oxygen the body can consume during heavy dynamic exercise for the aerobic production of ATP is called maximal oxygen uptake, or
 

. Because
 

 is primarily an index of cardiorespiratory power, and as such is used as a measure of cardiovascular-respiratory fitness, it is discussed in depth in that unit. However, because
 

 reflects the amount of oxygen available for the aerobic production of ATP, it is also an important metabolic measure. Both aerobic and anaerobic exercises are often described in terms of a given percentage of
 

 (either < or >100%
 

), that is submaximal, maximal and supramaximal. Anaerobic metabolic processes are important at the onset of all aerobic exercise, contribute significantly at submaximal levels, and increase their contribution as the exercise intensity gets progressively higher. Depending on an individual’s fitness level, lactic anaerobic metabolism begins to make a significant contribution to dynamic activity at approximately 40–60%
 

. However, even then the ability to use oxygen is most important. By between 1 and 2 minutes of maximal exercise, the relative contributions of ATP production from the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems are approximately equal (

Gastin, 2001

). Because the aerobic system involves the use of oxygen and proceeds completely to oxidative phosphorylation, it is said to be
 aerobic
 or
 oxidative
. Sport activities that rely predominantly on the O
2
 system include long-distance events, such as the 5,000 and 10,000 m in track; marathons; swimming 1,500 m; cross-country running, skiing, and orienteering; field hockey, soccer, and lacrosse; and race walking.




These three sources of ATP—the phosphagen system (ATP-PC), the glycolytic system (LA), and the oxidative system (O
2
)—contribute to maximal exercise of different durations in a pattern called the
 time-energy system continuum
. This continuum assumes that the individual is working at a maximal maintainable intensity for a continuous duration. This means that it is assumed that an individual can go all out for 5 minutes or less or can work at 100%
 

 for 10 minutes, at 95%
 

 for 30 minutes, at 85%
 

 for 60 minutes, and at 80%
 

 for 120 minutes. Of course, there are individual differences, but these assumptions are reasonable in general.





Figure 3.2

 differentiates the anaerobic systems into the ATP-PC and LA as well as indicates that the O
2
 system participates quickly in all-out maximal exercise lasting 300 seconds (5 minutes) or less (

Gastin, 2001

). Note that both anaerobic systems respond immediately but neither can sustain the high level of ATP production needed. The LA system contributes more than does the ATP-PC by approximately 10 seconds. Conversely, the aerobic energy system (O
2
) is incapable of meeting the immediate energy demands but contributes to a meaningful degree quickly.

Figure 3.3

 shows the best estimates available of the relative contributions of the combined anaerobic (ATP-PC plus LA) systems and the aerobic energy system to the total energy requirement for exercise durations up to 120 minutes. Again, initially the anaerobic systems predominate, but by 30 seconds more than 20% of the ATP is being supplied by oxidative phosphorylation. The

 point at which the aerobic and anaerobic contribution becomes approximately equal is 75 seconds (

Figure 3.2

). From then on, the aerobic system dominates.

 at 10 minutes; 95%

 at 60 minutes; and 80%

Four basic patterns can be discerned from this continuum. Understanding these patterns is helpful when developing training programs.




1.
 All three energy systems (ATP-PC, LA, O
2
) are involved in providing energy for all durations of exercise.




2.
 The ATP-PC system predominates in activities lasting 10 seconds or less. Since the ATP-PC system is involved primarily at the onset of longer activities, it becomes a smaller portion of the total energy supply as duration gets longer.




3.
 Anaerobic metabolism (ATP-PC and LA) predominates in supplying energy for exercises lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. The equal contribution point for anaerobic and aerobic energy contribution to maximal exercise is probably close to 75 seconds. However, even exercises lasting as long as 10 minutes use at least 15% anaerobic sources. Within the anaerobic component the longer the duration, the greater the relative importance of the lactic acid system in comparison to the phosphagen system.




4.
 By 2 minutes of exercise, the O
2
 system clearly dominates. The longer the duration, the more important it becomes.




The rest of this chapter concentrates on the anaerobic contribution to energy metabolism.
 
Chapter 4

 then focuses on the aerobic contribution to energy metabolism, although again it must be emphasized that the two systems work together, with one or the other predominating based primarily on the duration and intensity of the activity.





Anaerobic Energy Production




Alactic Anaerobic PC Production


As previously described, alactic anaerobic production of ATP involves the use of phosphocreatine PC, which is simply creatine bound to inorganic phosphate. An adult human has a creatine level of approximately 120–140 mmol·kg−1
 of dry muscle, although there is considerable individual variation from a low of 90–100 mmol·kg−1
 to a high of about 150–160 mmol·
kg−1
. Each day approximately 2 g of creatine are degraded in a nonreversible reaction to creatinine. This creatinine is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in urine. The loss is counterbalanced under normal dietary conditions by the ingestion of about 1 g of creatine from meat, poultry, and/or fish and the synthesis of another gram in the liver from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine. Close to 95% of the creatine in the body is stored in skeletal muscle. Thirty to forty percent is stored as free creatine and the rest as phosphocreatine.




Figure 3.4

 shows the breakdown of ATP and PC during heavy exercise. It also shows the restoration of ATP from energy substrate sources and the restoration of PC from the regenerated ATP. The process continues until the resting levels of both PC and ATP are regained. Specifically, when ATP is hydrolyzed by the contractile proteins in muscle (1) (large inner circle), the resulting ADP is rephosphorylated in the cytoplasm by the PC available there (2) (small inner circle). In turn, the now free creatine is rephosphorylated at the inner mitochondrial membrane from the breakdown of ATP produced at that site (3) (large outside oval). The remnant (4) ADP is then free, in turn, to be phosphorylated again by oxidative phosphorylation using energy substrates. In addition to providing ATP rapidly, this mechanism, called the

 creatine phosphate shuttle, is one way in which electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation are regulated (

Brooks et al., 1999

).

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Creatine as an Ergogenic Aid






Creatine (C) [primarily in the form of creatine monohydrate (CM)] continues to enjoy unprecedented popularity as an ergogenic aid. It has been established that oral creatine supplementation can increase muscle creatine (C) content by approximately 10–40%, depending on an individual’s starting muscular concentration. There is an upper limit for storage, so if an individual is already at that point (~160 mmol·kg−1
 of dry muscle), supplementation will not further increase storage. Excess ingested creatine is excreted in the urine (American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM] Roundtable, 2000
; Buford et al., 2007
). This can explain why one individual might respond to creatine monohydrate supplementation and another might be a “nonresponder.” The relative percentage of muscle fibers can also impact the response to creatine ingestion such that individuals with higher percentages of type II fibers have a higher response potential (Cooper et al., 2012
). Training status may impact C uptake during a loading phase because intramuscular levels may already be elevated (Bemben and Lamont, 2005
).







Metabolically, there are three primary mechanisms to explain how increased levels of creatine in muscle could impact anaerobic energy production: (1) increased C means increased levels of PC for increased rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP; (2) stimulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, occurs when PC levels decline as PC is used for the increased rephosphorylation of ATP (

Bemben and Lamont, 2005

); and (3) increased muscle glycogen when combined with a high-carbohydrate diet (

Cooper et al., 2012

;
 
Rawson and Persky, 2007

). Molecular adaptation, that is, an increased gene expression of growth factors, and reduced muscle damage also occur (

Poortmans et al., 2010

). These adaptations allow an individual to train harder and recover faster (

Buford et al., 2007

). A number of studies have also indicated that creatine supplementation, along with heavy resistance training, enhances the normal training adaptation (

ACSM Roundtable, 2000

;
 
Cooper et al., 2012

). Creatine does not increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis (

Poortmans et al., 2010

).








There are studies that have shown no improvement with creatine supplementation (

Misic and Kelley, 2002

) and others that have shown significant improvement (

Branch, 2003

). On the whole, of the several hundred peer-reviewed published research studies, nearly 70% have reported a significant improvement in exercise capacity (

ACSM Roundtable, 2000

;
 
Buford et al., 2007

;
 
Cooper et al., 2012

;
 
Jäger et al., 2011

;
 
Luckose et al., 2015

). The effectiveness of creatine depends in large part on the exercise category. The greatest improvement in performance seems to occur in the later bouts of a repetitive series of exercises in which the high power output lasts only a matter of seconds separated by rest periods of 20–60 seconds (

ACSM Roundtable, 2000

;
 
Sahlin, 2014

). A 2005 analysis by Bemben and Lamont concurred that the use of CM is effective for short-term high-intensity activities, especially when the activity involves repeated bouts. They also concluded, however, that whether or not peak force appeared to benefit from CM supplementation depended on the type of muscle contraction. Dynamic isotonic peak force measures seem to benefit, isokinetic results are mixed, and there is little benefit for isometric measures. Typical improvement ranges from approximately 2% in increased lean body mass, approximately 11% in muscle strength, and approximately 8% in high-intensity exercise performance. No studies have reported an impairment of exercise performance. The International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand—Creatine Supplementation and Exercise (2007, p. 1)—concluded that “creatine monohydrate is the most effective ergogenic nutritional supplement currently available to athletes in terms of increasing high-intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass during training.” The addition of carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein combined to creatine appears to increase muscular retention of creatine; however, the effect on performance currently does not appear to be any greater than using CM alone (

Buford et al., 2007

). There is no evidence that any of the newer forms of creatine are more effective and/or safer than CM whether ingested alone or in combination with other ingredients (

Jäger et al., 2011

).












As with any supplement, concerns have been expressed regarding the safety of creatine ingestion. Although there have been numerous anecdotal reports of gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), liver and kidney dysfunction, cardiovascular/thermal impairment, and muscular damage (cramps, strains), credible reviews have concluded that, with the notable exception of individuals with medically documented preexisting kidney problems (that were aggravated with creatine supplementation and resolved when the supplementation was stopped), there is no scientific evidence that the short- or long-term use of CM has any detrimental effects on otherwise healthy individuals (

Buford et al., 2007

;
 
Jäger et al., 2011

;
 
Luckose et al., 2015

). When gastrointestinal upset occurs, it can often be resolved by dissolving the creatine in some viscous food such as yogurt (instead of just water) and taking it in divided doses (

Tarnopolsky, 2010

). In addition, recent evidence suggests that creatine neither hinders the body’s ability to dissipate heat nor negatively affects body fluid balance (

Lopez et al., 2009

). Creatine may actually enhance performance in hot/humid conditions by maintaining hematocrit, aiding thermoregulation, reducing exercising heart rate and sweat rate, and maintaining plasma volume (

Dalbo et al., 2008

). Creatine loading is associated with an increase in body weight of approximately 2%; thus, in individuals with otherwise stable weight, an increase in weight can be used as a rough marker that creatine is actually being loaded (

Sahlin, 2014

). The evidence of safety is strong at intakes up to 5 g·d
−1
 for chronic supplementation for up to 5 years (

Cooper et al., 2012

;
 
Shao and Hathcock, 2006

;
 
Tarnopolsky, 2010

). This does not mean that there are no precautions. The following are advised (

ACSM Roundtable, 2000

;
 
Bemben and Lamont, 2005

;
 
Poortmans et al., 2010

):






1.
 Individuals with preexisting kidney dysfunction or those at high risk for kidney disease (e.g., diabetics and individuals with a family history of kidney disease) should either avoid creatine supplementation or undergo regular medical monitoring. Regular checkups are recommended for everyone taking creatine because any individual may react adversely to any substance, and excess creatine is a burden that must be eliminated by the kidneys.




2.
 Individuals wishing to maintain or decrease body weight while participating in strenuous exercise should avoid creatine supplementation.




3.
 Adequate fluid and electrolytes should always be ingested.




4.
 Pregnant or lactating females should not supplement with creatine.




5.
 The ingestion of creatine during exercise should be avoided.






There appears to be no systematic sex or age difference in the results of C supplementation (

Bemben and Lamont, 2005

). While fewer studies have been conducted using children or adolescent participants, and these have primarily been therapeutic interventions, none have shown CM to have adverse effects in this population. Thus, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (2007) recommends the following guidelines for the use of CM by adolescents:






1.
 The athlete should be postpubertal and involved in competitive training of the type of activity that would benefit from CM supplementation.




2.
 The athlete should be eating a well-balanced, performance-enhancing diet.




3.
 The athlete and his or her parents should understand the truth concerning the effects of CM supplementation.




4.
 The athlete’s parents should have approved the supplementation.




5.
 CM supplementation should be supervised by the parents, trainers, coaches, and/or physician.




6.
 Quality supplements should be used.




7.
 The athlete should not exceed recommended dosages.






A typical creatine protocol consists of a loading phase of 20 g of CM split into four daily intakes of 5 g each or 0.3 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 of CM for 3–5 days followed by a maintenance phase of 3–5 g·d
−1
 (or 0.03 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
) for the duration of desired supplementation.








CM products are readily available as a dietary supplement and are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a dietary ingredient. The legal and regulatory status of other forms is somewhat ambiguous. CM is approved as a natural health product in Canada by the Natural Health Products Directorate (

Jäger et al., 2011

). Creatine supplementation is not currently banned by any athletic organization although the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) does not allow institutions to provide CM supplements for athletes. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled that there was no need to ban creatine since it is naturally found in food and there is no valid noninvasive test to determine supplementation (

Buford et al., 2007

). These rulings, of course, can change at any time, so the wise athlete will check before supplementing.

Lactic Acid/Lactate Levels


Lactic acid is produced in muscle cells when the NADH + H+
 formed in glycolysis (step 6; see Figure 2.6
 in Chapter 2
) is oxidized to NAD+
 by a transfer of the hydrogen ions to pyruvic acid (C3
H4
O3
), which in turn is reduced to lactic acid (C3
H6
O3
) (Brooks, 1985
; Newsholme and Leech, 1983
). In muscle tissue, lactic acid is produced in amounts that are in equilibrium with pyruvic acid under normal resting conditions. As stated in Chapter 2
, there is some unresolved controversy as to whether skeletal muscle actually produces lactate or lactic acid although lactic acid, not lactate, represents the accepted classic view (Brooks, 2010
; Marcinek et al., 2010
; Robergs et al., 2004
). Even if lactic acid is the substance actually produced, at physiological pH 99% of the lactic acid is dissociated immediately to H+
 and La−
 (lactate) (Brooks, 1985
; Gladden, 2004
). In addition, lactic acid is always produced by red blood cells, portions of the kidneys, and certain tissues within the eye. Both resting and exercise blood lactate values depend on the balance between lactic acid/lactate production
 (appearance
) and removal
 (disappearance
 or clearance
). This balance of appearance and clearance is called turnover
. When production exceeds removal, lactate is said to accumulate. The issues, then, especially during exercise, focus on what conditions result in lactic acid/lactate production and what processes lead to lactate removal. When blood lactate levels are measured, they reflect the balance of lactate production and removal. The major contributors to lactate production and removal are summarized in Figure 3.5
.









FIGURE 3.5
 The Balance between Lactate Production and Clearance.
 Lactate accumulation in the blood is the result of the balance between lactate production and lactate clearance. Normal resting blood values are usually ≤2.0 mmol·
L−1
.




Lactic Acid/Lactate Production


In general, the relative rates of glycolytic activity (stage I of carbohydrate metabolism) and oxidative activity (stages II, III, and IV) determine the production of lactic acid/lactate. Specifically, five factors play important roles: muscle contraction, enzyme activity, muscle fiber type, sympathetic nervous system activation, and insufficient oxygen (anaerobiosis, the onset of anaerobic metabolism).



1.
 Muscle contraction. During exercise, muscle activity obviously increases. Muscle contraction involves the release of calcium (Ca
2+
) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition to its role in the coupling process of actin and myosin, calcium also causes glycogenolysis by activating the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogen is processed by fast glycolysis and results in the production of lactic acid/lactate regardless of whether oxygen levels are sufficient or not (

Brooks et al., 1999

;
 
Fox, 1973

).




2.
 Enzyme activity. The conversion of pyruvate and NADH + H
+
 to lactate and NAD
+
 is catalyzed by specific isozymes of the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), whereas the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA (stage II) prior to entry into the Krebs cycle is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). LDH has the highest rate of functioning of any of the glycolytic enzymes and is much more active than the enzymes that provide alternate pathways for

 pyruvate metabolism, including PDH and the rate-limiting enzymes in the Krebs cycle. Any increase in pyruvate and NADH + H
+
 further increases the activity of LDH and results in the production of lactic acid/lactate (

Spriet et al., 2000

). Therefore, lactic acid production is an inevitable consequence of glycolysis (

Brooks, 1986

;
 
Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

;
 
Spriet et al., 2000

). The more pyruvate provided, the more lactate produced. The shifting of the hydrogen atoms from NADH + H
+
 to pyruvate-forming lactate serves to maintain the redox potential of the cell. The redox, or oxidation-reduction, potential is the ratio of NADH + H
+
 to NAD
+
. There is a finite amount of NAD
+
 available in the cytoplasm to accept hydrogen atoms in step 6 and keep glycolysis going. To maintain this supply, NADH + H
+
 must either transfer the hydrogen atoms into the mitochondria to the electron transport chain or give them up to pyruvate.




3.
 Muscle fiber type. During high-intensity, short-duration activities, FG muscle fibers are preferentially recruited. These fast-contracting glycolytic fibers produce lactic acid/lactate when they contract, regardless of whether oxygen is present in sufficient amounts or not. This response appears to be a function of the specific LDH isozyme and the low mitochondrial density found in these fibers. Different LDH isozymes are found in different fibers (

Green, 1986

). LDH isozymes 4 and 5 predominate in fast-twitch fibers and facilitate the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Conversely, LDH isozymes 1 and 2 predominate in cardiac, slow twitch oxidative (SO), and fast-twitch mitochondria and catalyze the conversion of lactate to pyruvate (

Houston, 1995

).




4.
 Sympathetic neurohormonal activation. During heavy exercise, activity of the sympathetic nervous system stimulates the release of epinephrine and glucagon and suppression of insulin (see
 
Figure 2.17

 in
 
Chapter 2

). The result is the breakdown of glycogen, leading ultimately to high levels of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). (Refresh your memory by referring to
 
Figure 2.6

, if necessary, to locate G6P in glycolysis.) High levels of G6P increase the rate of glycolysis and thus the production of pyruvic acid (

Brooks, 1986

). As previously described, any increase in pyruvate and NADH + H
+
 ultimately results in an increase in lactic acid/lactate. In addition, late in prolonged endurance activity, epinephrine-mediated glycogen breakdown may bring about the release of lactate from resting muscle when an increased lactate release is no longer occurring in contracting muscles (

Stallknecht et al., 1998

).




5.
 Insufficient oxygen (anaerobiosis, onset of anaerobic metabolism). Finally, during high-intensity, short-duration or near-maximal exercise or during static contractions when blood flow is impeded (

Stallknecht et al., 1998

), the delivery of oxygen to the mitochondria—and thus the availability of oxygen as the final electron acceptor at the end of the respiratory chain—can become deficient. In these circumstances, glycolysis proceeds at a rate that produces larger quantities of NADH + H
+
 than the mitochondria have oxygen to accept. Again, “something” has to be done with the hydrogen atoms so that the NAD
+
 can be regenerated. That “something” is the transfer of the hydrogen atoms to pyruvic acid and the formation of lactic acid, which dissociates quickly to lactate.




Thus, although lactic acid is associated with high-intensity, short-duration exercise, this is not the only exercise condition that results in the production of lactic acid/lactate. Furthermore, although a lack of oxygen can contribute to the production of lactic acid, the presence of lactic acid/lactate does not absolutely indicate a lack of oxygen. The presence of lactate simply reflects the use of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway for ATP production and the balance between glycolytic and mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, rather than lactic acid being a “waste product,” lactate provides a means of coordinating carbohydrate metabolism in diverse tissues (

Brooks et al., 1999

). The formation, distribution, and utilization of lactate is a way for glycogen reserves to be mobilized and used within either the working muscle cell or other cells. In the process, blood glucose is spared for use by other tissues (

Brooks, 2002

;
 
Gladden, 2004

). The use or reconversion of lactate, or both, constitute lactate clearance.



Lactate Clearance


Blood lactate levels reflect the balance between lactic acid/lactate production (appearance) and clearance (removal). Lactate clearance (Figure 3.5
) occurs primarily by three processes: oxidation (50–75%), gluconeogenesis/glyconeogenesis (10–25%), and transamination (5–10%). All three processes can involve the movement of lactate, either within or between cells.



As stated previously, although produced as lactic acid, at physiological pH more than 99% quickly dissociates into lactate (La
−
) anions and protons (H
+
) (

Gladden, 2004

). Lactate moves readily between cytoplasm and mitochondria, muscle and blood, blood and muscle, active and inactive muscle, glycolytic and oxidative muscle, blood and heart, blood and liver, and blood and skin (

Brooks, 2000

). Lactate moves between lactate-producing and lactate-consuming sites through intracellular and extracellular lactate shuttles (

Brooks, 2002

). Transport across cellular and mitochondrial membranes occurs by facilitated exchange down concentration and hydrogen ion (pH) gradients using lactate transport proteins known as monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (

Brooks, 2000

;
 
Gladden, 2004

).




As of 2012, 14 monocarboxylate transporters had been reported in the literature. Two of these, MCT1 and MCT4, are important in skeletal muscles. MCT1 is abundant in oxidative skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and mitochondrial membranes. Its primary role is to take up lactate from the circulation. It also functions to shuttle lactate between and within muscle fibers. MCT4 is most prevalent in the cell membranes of glycolytic skeletal fibers and is especially suited for lactate/lactic acid export from those cells. MCT1 and MCT4 transport lactate and

 protons, thus playing important roles in regulating intracellular pH since they facilitate most of the H
+
 efflux from working muscles. Acute exercise produces an increase in both MCT1 and MCT4 with the change being greater in MCT1 than MCT4 (

Thomas et al., 2012

).




The
 intracellular lactate shuttle
 (

Figure 3.6A

) involves the movement of lactate by MCT1 transporters between the cytoplasm, where it is produced, and the mitochondria. Once inside the mitochondria, lactate is oxidized to pyruvate under the influence of the isozyme LDH1 and NAD
+
 is reduced to NADH + H
+
.
 This occurs in the intermembrane space adjacent to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The pyruvate proceeds through stages II, III, and IV of aerobic metabolism, while the NADH + H
+
 goes directly to stage IV. This is a relatively new and somewhat controversial concept that indicates that muscle cells can both produce and consume lactate at the same time (

FIGURE 3.6
 Intracellular and Extracellular Lactate Shuttles.
 A.
 The intracellular lactate shuttle transports lactate from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria by MCT1 transporters, where it is reconverted to pyruvate and proceeds through stages II, III, and IV of metabolism. B.
The extracellular lactate shuttle moves lactate directly between lactic-acid-producing FG fibers (FOG and FG) and lactate-consuming SO fibers. It also transports lactate through the circulation to the liver, skin, and heart, where it is cleared by oxidation, transamination, gluconeogenesis, or excretion. Most lactate remaining in FG fibers is reconverted to glycogen by glyconeogenesis.





Extracellular lactate shuttles
 act to move lactate between tissues (

Figure 3.6B

). Muscle cell membrane lactate proteins (MCT1 and MCT4) move the lactate both out of and into tissues. Intermuscularly, most lactate moves out of active fast-twitch glycolytic skeletal muscle cells (both fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic [FOG] and fast-twitch glycolytic [FG]) and into active slow-twitch oxidative (SO) skeletal muscle cells. This can occur either by a direct shuttle between the skeletal muscle cells or through the circulation. Once lactate is in the bloodstream, it can also circulate to cardiac cells. During heavy exercise, lactate becomes the preferred fuel of the heart. In this manner, glycogenolysis in one cell can supply fuel for another cell. In each of these cases, the ultimate fate of the lactate is oxidation to ATP, CO
2
, and H
2
O by aerobic metabolism (

Brooks, 1986

,
 
2000

;
 
Chatham, 2002

;
 
Emhoff et al., 2013

).




Lactate circulating in the bloodstream can also be transported to the liver where, as described in
 
Chapter 2

, it is reconverted into glucose by the process of gluconeogenesis. Indeed, the liver appears to preferentially make glycogen from lactate rather than glucose. In human glycolytic muscle fibers (both fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic and fast-twitch glycolytic), some of the lactate produced during high-intensity exercise is retained, and in the postexercise recovery period it is reconverted to glycogen in that muscle cell. This process is called glyconeogenesis (

Brooks et al., 1999

;
 
Donovan and Pagliassotti, 2000

;
 
Emhoff et al., 2013

;
 
Gladden, 2000

).




Both oxidative and glycolytic fibers can also clear lactate by transamination. Transamination forms keto acids (Krebs cycle intermediates) and amino acids. The predominant amino acid produced is alanine. In turn, alanine can undergo gluconeogenesis in the liver (

Brooks, 1986

;
 
Emhoff et al., 2013

;
 
Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

).




A small amount of lactate in the circulation moves from the blood to the skin and exits the body in sweat. Finally, some lactate remains as lactate circulating in the blood. This constitutes the resting lactate level.




Oxidation is by far the predominant process of lactate clearance both during and after exercise. The accumulation of lactate in the blood depends on the relative rate of appearance (production) and disappearance (clearance),

 which in turn is directly related to the intensity and duration of the exercise being done.





Measurement of Anaerobic Metabolism




Laboratory Procedures


Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted means by which to directly measure the contribution of anaerobic energy to exercise. Two general approaches are used, however, to describe the anaerobic exercise response. One approach describes changes in the chemical substances either used in alactic anaerobic metabolism (specifically, ATP and PC levels) or produced as a result of lactic anaerobic metabolism (lactate). The second approach quantifies the amount of work performed or the power generated during short-duration, high-intensity activity. The assumption is that such activity could not be done without anaerobic energy; therefore, measuring such work or power indirectly measures anaerobic energy utilization and provides an indication of anaerobic capacity.


ATP-PC and Lactate


Muscle ATP, PC, and lactate can be measured by chemical analysis of muscle biopsy specimens. Lactate is the most frequently measured variable, in part because it can also be measured from blood samples. The blood sample may be obtained by venipuncture or by finger or ear lobe prick, both of which are less invasive than a muscle biopsy. Another reason for the popularity of lactate analysis is the availability of user-friendly, fast, accurate, and relatively inexpensive analyzers. Figure 3.7
 shows an analyzer that requires a minimal blood sample (a 25-μL capillary tube obtained by a finger prick); it is portable and takes less than 5 minutes for each sample analysis. Even smaller, less expensive, handheld analyzers are available (Figure 3.7C
).

Remember that at normal pH levels, lactic acid almost completely dissociates into hydrogen ions (H
+
) and lactate (C
3
H
5
O
3
−
, designated as La
−
). Thus, technically, lactic acid may or may not be what is formed, but lactate is what is measured in the bloodstream. Despite this distinction, the terms lactic acid and lactate are often used synonymously (

Brooks, 1985

;
 
Gladden, 2004

).




Lactate is a small molecule that moves easily from the muscles to the blood and most other fluid compartments. However, much of the lactate that is produced does not get into the bloodstream. It takes time for the portion that does get into the bloodstream to reach equilibrium between muscle and blood. This equilibrium and the achievement of peak blood values may take as long as 5–10 minutes. Until equilibrium occurs, muscle lactate values will be higher than blood lactate values. This also means that the highest blood lactate values are typically seen after several minutes of recovery, not during high-intensity work (

Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973

).




Lactate levels are reported using a variety of units. The two most common are millimoles per liter (mmol·L
−1
, sometimes designated as mM) or milligrams per 100 mL of blood (mg·100 mL
−1
, sometimes designated as mg% or mg·dL
−1
). One mmol·L
−1
 is equal to 9 mg·100 mL
−1
. Resting levels of lactate of 1–2 mmol·L
−1
 or 9–18 mg· 100 mL
−1
 are typical. A value of 8 mmol·L
−1
 or 72 mg·100 mL
−1
 is usually taken to indicate that an individual has worked maximally (

Åstrand et al., 2003

). Peak values as high as 32 mmol·L
−1
 or 288 mg·100 mL
−1
 have been reported

.



Tests of Anaerobic Power and Capacity



Energy system capacity
 is the total amount of energy that can be produced by an energy system. Energy system power
 is the maximal amount of energy that can be produced per unit of time. Table 3.1
 clearly shows that the phosphagen (ATP-PC) system is predominantly a power system with very little capacity. The lactic anaerobic glycolytic system has almost equal power and capacity, just slightly favoring capacity. The information on the aerobic (O2
) system is included here just to show how truly high in power and low in capacity the anaerobic systems are.

, 1991

Although the ATP-PC system can put out energy at the rate of 72 kcal·min
−1
, it can sustain that value when working maximally only for 9–10 seconds, for a total output of only 11 kcal (72 kcal·min
−1
/60 sec·min
−1
 = 1.2 kcal·sec
−1
; 11 total kcal/1.2 kcal·sec
−1
 = 9.17 seconds). The LA system has a lower power (36 kcal·min
−1
), but can sustain it for almost 1 minute and 20 seconds (48 kcal/36 kcal·min
−1
 = 1.33 minutes = 1:20). By comparison, if the O
2
 system worked at a power output of 9 kcal·min
−1
, exercise could be sustained for more than 2 hours (1,268 kcal/9 kcal·min
−1
 = 141 minutes = 2:21) just using carbohydrate fuel sources. In fact, when all fuel supplies are included within a healthy, well-fed body, the capacity of the aerobic system is, for all intents and purposes, unlimited.




For measuring the anaerobic systems, an ideal test would distinctly evaluate alactic anaerobic power, alactic anaerobic capacity, lactic anaerobic power, and lactic anaerobic capacity. Because no such test exists, attempts have been made to get this information indirectly by measuring (1) the total mechanical power generated during high-intensity, short-duration work; (2) the amount of mechanical work done in a specific period of time; or (3) the time required to perform a given amount of presumably anaerobic work (

Green, 1995

). Two such tests are commonly used in laboratory settings: the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) and the Maragaria-Kalamen Stair Climb (

Bouchard et al., 1982

).

THE WINGATE ANAEROBIC TEST The Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) depicted in Figure 3.8
 is probably the most well-known of several bicycle ergometer tests used to measure anaerobic power and capacity and is considered to be the “gold standard” or criterion test. The test traditionally begins with pedaling against little or no resistance and then is an all-out ride for 30 seconds against a resistance based on body weight. Both arm and leg versions are available, although the leg test is most frequently used and will be the only version discussed here. Resistance values of 0.075 kg·kg−1
 body weight for children, 0.085 kg·kg−1
 body weight for adult females, and 0.095 kg·kg−1
 body weight for adult males appear to be optimal although research continues in this area (Jaafar et al., 2014
). Athletes may need values as high as 0.10 kg·kg−1
 of body weight, but the most common value used (as in the example that follows) is 0.075 kg·kg−1
 body weight (Vandewalle et al., 1987
). The revolutions (rev) of the flywheel are counted per second during the test, and from the available information three variables are determined.









FIGURE 3.8
 Wingate Anaerobic Test.
 This individual is performing the WAnT. Once she is pedaling as fast as she can, the tester releases the weight, providing a resistance based on the subject’s body weight. The individual then continues to pedal as quickly as possible for 30 seconds. Data from sensors attached to the flywheel are relayed to the computer for calculation of peak power, mean power, and fatigue index.




Computer-generated results from a typical test with a resistance of 4.4 kg are given in Table 3.2
. The subject was a 129-lb female physical education major, but not an athlete. The data can be used to calculate three variables: peak power, mean power, and fatigue index. Peak power (PP)
 is the maximal mechanical power (force times distance divided by time) exerted during very-short-duration (5 seconds or less) work.
 Mean power (MP)
 is the average mechanical power (force times distance divided by time) exerted during short-duration (typically 30 seconds) work. The fatigue index (FI)
 is the percentage of peak power (PP) drop-off during high-intensity, short-duration work. Each of these variables requires the use of different time periods in the calculations.

The first variable computed is peak power (PP), the maximum power exerted during the highest 5-second period. This usually occurs early in the activity and, in the example given, is the time between 2 and 6 seconds when 10.25 rev were completed. Peak power can be expressed in absolute terms as kgm·5 sec
−1
 or prorated to a full minute as kgm·min
−1
 or watts (W). Peak power can also be expressed relative to body weight as kgm·5 sec
−1
·kg

, kgm·min

, or W·kg

. The formula for peak power is

Relative to body weight PP is












When converted to watts (1 W = 6.12 kgm·min
−1
), the relative value is












Peak power was originally thought to reflect only alactic processes—alactic anaerobic capacity, in particular. However, subsequent research has shown that muscle lactate levels rise to high values as early as 10 seconds into

 such high-intensity work. This indicates that glycolytic processes are occurring almost immediately along with ATP-CP breakdown. Therefore, peak power cannot be interpreted as being only alactical though it is predominantly alactic (

Bar-Or, 1987

;
 
Beneke et al., 2002

;
 
Bertuzzi et al, 2015

).




The second variable calculated is mean power, which can also be expressed in both absolute and relative units. Mean power is the average power sustained throughout the 30-second ride. The formula for mean power is

Example






Thus, for this example the calculation is

Mean power is sometimes said to represent lactic anaerobic capacity. Although lactic anaerobic metabolism is not the only energy system operating during this time, it is the predominant energy system (

Bar-Or, 1987

;
 
Beneke et al., 2002

;
 
Bertuzzi et al., 2015

).




The third variable that can be computed is the fatigue index (FI) or the percentage of peak power drop-off during high-intensity, short-duration work. It is calculated using the highest 5-second power (PP) and the lowest 5-second power (LP). Little is known about the relationship of the fatigue index to anaerobic fitness (

Bar-Or, 1987

).



3.3 







Example






In our example, the highest 5-second power is 270.6 kgm. Using the peak power formula of Equation 3.1 but with the lowest 5-second total, we get











Although the WAnT is not a purely anaerobic test (a meaningful aerobic component of ~19–22% has been measured), it is predominantly (~80%) anaerobic (with ~31–33% of the energy being supplied by the ATP-PC system and 45–51% by the lactate system (

Beneke et al., 2007

;
 
Beneke et al., 2002

). It compares well (with correlations generally above 0.75) with other tests of anaerobic power and capacity and is widely used (

Bar-Or, 1987

;
 
Patton and Duggan, 1987

).



THE MARGARIA-KALAMEN STAIR CLIMB To perform the Margaria-Kalamen test, an individual runs for 6 m on the level and then climbs a staircase, taking three steps at a time. Power in kgm·sec−1
 is calculated from the weight of the subject, the vertical height between the third and ninth steps, and the time between the third and ninth steps (Bouchard et al., 1982
; Vandewalle et al., 1987
). The use of electronic switch mats or photoelectric cells is essential for accuracy. This test is considered to be a test of alactic anaerobic power because of the short time involved—usually less than 5 seconds for the entire test and close to 1 second for the measured time between the third and ninth steps.


Field Tests


No field tests are available to estimate the ATP-PC used or the lactate produced during exercise. However, performance in high-intensity, short-duration activity can give an indication of anaerobic power and capacity. Sport-specific tests are available, but two types of activities are commonly used: vertical jump tests and sprints (sometimes done as shuttles) or middle-distance runs.



In the single vertical jump tests, several different protocols are used, including variations in the starting posture, the use or nonuse of arms, and what body part displacement is measured. The one commonality is the end value measured: the height jumped. When the jump is performed on a force platform, actual power values can be calculated, and the test is considered a laboratory test. When the jump is performed as a field test on a normal surface, an estimate of work (force × distance), not power, is calculated. The height of the vertical jump and peak power as determined from force plate data has been shown to be highly correlated (
r
 = 0.92). For these reasons, vertical jump height is seen as an acceptable indicator of anaerobic alactic power (

Payne et al., 2000

;
 
Vandewalle et al., 1987

)

.




For sprints, shuttle, or middle-distance runs, the involvement of the various energy systems is related to the time of the all-out activity, as shown in
 
Figure 3.3

. Therefore, runs whose distance can be covered in a distinct time range (depending somewhat on age, sex, and training status) can be used as field tests of anaerobic metabolism (

Cheetham et al., 1986

;
 
Thomas et al., 2002

). For example, dashes of 40, 50, or 60 yd or m will take approximately 4–15 seconds and can be used as an indication of alactic anaerobic power and/or capacity. Longer runs, probably between 200 and 800 m (or 220 and 880 yd) and lasting 30–120 seconds, can be used as an indication of lactic anaerobic power and capacity. Faster speeds covering a given distance would indicate increased anaerobic power and/or capacity. The Hawaii Anaerobic Run Test of 200 m with each 25 m split being timed allows for the calculation of peak momentum, mean momentum, and fatigue index that has been shown to be reliable and valid when compared to the WAnT (

Kimura et al., 2014

).





The Anaerobic Exercise Response




Oxygen Deficit and Excess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption


When exercise begins, regardless of how light or heavy it is, there is an immediate need for additional energy. Thus, the most obvious exercise response is an increase in metabolism. All three energy systems are involved in this response, their relative contributions being proportional to the intensity and duration of the activity.




Figure 3.9

 shows two scenarios for going from rest to different intensities of exercise. In
 
Figure 3.9

A,
 the activity is a moderate submaximal bout. The oxygen requirement for this exercise is 1.4 L·min
−1
. The individual has a
 

 of 2.5 L·min
−1
. Therefore, this individual is working at 56%
 

. The area under the smoothed curve during both exercise and recovery represents oxygen used. Notice, however, that there is an initial lag during which the oxygen supplied and utilized is below the oxygen requirement for providing energy. This difference between the oxygen required during exercise and the oxygen supplied and utilized is called the
 oxygen deficit
. Because of this discrepancy between supply and demand, anaerobic sources must be involved in providing energy at the onset of all activity.










FIGURE 3.9
 Oxygen Deficit and Excess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC) during Submaximal Exercise and Supramaximal Exercise.
 A.
 During light to moderate submaximal exercise, both the oxygen deficit, indicated by the convex curve at the start of exercise, and the excess postexercise oxygen consumption, indicated by the concave curve during the recovery time period, are small. B.
 During heavy or supramaximal exercise, both the O2
 deficit and the EPOC are large. Under both conditions, energy is supplied during the O2
 deficit period by using stored ATP-PC, anaerobic glycolysis, and oxygen stores in capillary blood and bound to myoglobin. The heavier the exercise, the more the reliance on anaerobic glycolysis. The EPOC is a result of the restoration of ATP-PC, removal of lactate, restoration of O2
 stores, elevated cardiovascular and respiratory function, elevated hormonal levels, and especially, the elevated body temperature.





Evidence indicates that the O
2
 deficit is probably due to limited cellular utilization of O
2
 as a result of metabolic adjustments in both the anaerobic and aerobic systems. The relatively slow response time of aerobic ATP production is determined by the faster speed of response of the ATP-PC system and by the content of mitochondria in the muscle. The fact that the ATP-PC system responds rapidly does not indicate any intrinsic delay or inertia of activation for either the LA or O
2
 systems. All three pathways respond simultaneously in an integrated fashion. The metabolic response is regulated by a series of feedback control systems that are sensitive to the release of Ca
2+
 from muscle contraction and the breakdown of ATP (

Grassi, 2005

;
 
Hughson et al., 2001

;
 
Meyer and Wiseman, 2012

;
 
Sahlin et al., 1988

). The metabolic systems simply respond at different speeds. Therefore, during the transition from rest to work, energy is supplied by

Eventually, if the exercise intensity is low enough (as in the example in Figure 3.9A
), the aerobic system will predominate and the oxygen supply will equal the oxygen demand. This condition is called steady-state, steady-rate, or steady-level exercise.




Figure 3.9B

 shows a smoothed plot of O
2
 consumption at rest and during and after an exercise bout in which the energy requirement is greater than
 

, sometimes called
 supramaximal exercise
. The initial lag period between O
2
 supply and demand is once again evident, and as in the first example, the added energy is provided by stored ATP-PC, anaerobic glycolysis, and stored O
2
. However, in this case, when the O
2
 consumption plateaus or levels off, it is at
 

, and more energy is still needed if exercise is to continue.




This plateau is not considered to be a steady state because the energy demands are not totally being met aerobically. Supplemental energy is provided by anaerobic glycolysis. The exact energy demand in this situation is difficult to determine precisely because, as stated before, lactic acid levels do not reflect production alone. However, without the anaerobic energy contribution, this activity could not continue. The maximal ability to tolerate lactic acid accumulation will determine to a large extent how long the activity can continue.






Oxygen Deficit

Supramaximal Exercise

.



Excess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC)
 Oxygen consumption during recovery that is above normal resting values.





A practical application of oxygen deficit theory is a measurement called
 maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD)
. MAOD is the difference between the estimated accumulated oxygen demand (based on an extrapolation from 4 to 10 bouts of at least 4 minutes each of submaximal exercise and a maximal test to determine power output-oxygen uptake relationships) and the accumulated oxygen uptake measured during exhausting supramaximal exercise of 110–125%
 

 (

Bortolotti et al., 2010

;
 
Medbo et al., 1988

;
 
Noordhof et al., 2010

). MAOD relates highly to the WAnT, and is interpreted as a direct measure of anaerobic capacity (

Bertuzzi et al., 2015

;
 
Weber and Schneider, 2001

). During recovery from exercise, represented by the concave curves after exercise in
 
Figure 3.9A and B

, oxygen consumption drops quickly (a fast component lasting 2–3 minutes) and then tapers off (a slow component lasting 3–60 minutes). The magnitude and duration of this elevated postexercise oxygen consumption depends on the duration, intensity, and modality of the preceding exercise. After light submaximal work (

Figure 3.9A

), recovery takes place quickly; after heavy exercise (

Figure 3.9B

), recovery takes much longer. Note that although the oxygen consumption is expressed as L·min
−1
 in this figure, it can also be prorated by body weight and expressed as mL·kg·min
−1
. The terms
 O
2
 recovery
 or, more commonly,
 excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC)
 are used to describe this phenomenon. That is, EPOC is defined as the oxygen consumption during recovery that is above normal resting values. The relationship between the size of the EPOC and the intensity of aerobic exercise is curvilinear, whereas the relationship between the size of the EPOC and the duration of aerobic exercise is more linear (

Mann et al., 2014

). The relationship between EPOC and resistance exercise is less well defined, but intensity seems important here as well (

Børsheim and Bahr, 2003

). However, a recent study (

Scott et al., 2011

) found that for a single set of resistance training to fatigue, the recovery energy expenditure was similar in both strength and muscular endurance protocols; moreover, recovery energy expenditure had little to no relationship with aerobic and anaerobic exercise energy expenditure or work.

Drummond et al. (2005)

, make a recommendation as to whether this client should do the resistance workout first or the aerobic workout first. Explain your reasoning.








Check your answer in Appendix C.












A critical question is what causes this elevated metabolism in recovery. Although EPOC cannot be completely explained at this time, seven factors have been suggested.




1.
 Restoration of ATP-PC stores: About 10% of the EPOC is utilized to rephosphorylate creatine and ADP to PC and ATP, respectively, thus restoring these substances to resting levels (

Bahr, 1992

;
 
Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

). Approximately 50% of the ATP-PC is restored in 30 seconds (

Margaria et al., 1933

). This time is called the half-life restoration of ATP-PC. Full recovery requires 2–8 minutes (

Fox, 1973

; Harris et al., 1976; Hultman et al., 1967).




2.
 Restoration of O
2
 stores: Although the amount of O
2
 stored in the blood (bound to hemoglobin) and muscle (bound to myoglobin) is not large, it does need to be replenished when exercise stops. Replenishment probably occurs completely within 2–3 minutes (

Bahr, 1992

;
 
Stainsby and Barclay, 1970

).




3.
 Elevated cardiovascular-respiratory function: Both the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system remain elevated postexercise; that is, neither the breathing rate and depth nor heart rate recovers instantaneously. Although this enables the extra amounts of oxygen to be processed, the actual energy cost of these cardiovascular-respiratory processes probably accounts for only 1–2% of the excess oxygen (

Bahr, 1992

;
 
Stainsby and Barclay, 1970

).




4.
 Elevated hormonal levels: During exercise, the circulating levels of the catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), thyroxine, and cortisol are all increased (see
 
Figure 2.17

 and
 
Table 2.3

 in
 
Chapter 2

). In addition to their fuel mobilization and utilization effects, these hormones increase Na
+
–K
+
 pump activity in muscles and nerves by changing cell membrane permeability to Na
+
 and K
+
. As an active transport process, the Na
+
–K
+
 pump requires ATP. The increased need for ATP means an increased need for O
2
. Until the hormones are cleared from the bloodstream, the additional O
2
 and ATP use is a significant contributor to the EPOC (

Bahr, 1992

;
 
Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

).




5.
 Elevated body temperature: When ATP is broken down to supply the energy for chemical, electrical, or mechanical work, heat is produced as a by-product.

 During exercise, heat production may exceed heat dissipation, causing a rise in body core temperature. For each degree Celsius that body temperature rises, the metabolic rate increases approximately 13–15% (

Kapit et al., 2000

). Thus, in recovery, although high levels of energy are no longer needed to support the exercise, the influence of the elevated temperature remains, because cooling takes some time to occur. This temperature effect is by far the most important reason for EPOC, accounting for as much as 60–70% of the slow component after exercise at 50–80%
 

 (

Bahr, 1992

;
 
Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

).

 Lactate removal: The lactate that has accumulated must be removed. However, its contribution as a causative factor for EPOC is minimal (

Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

;
 
Stainsby and Barclay, 1970

).




7.
 Energy substrate shift: During recovery, the primary fuel utilized shifts from carbohydrate to fat. Fat requires more oxygen to process than does CHO and thus may be important in prolonging the slow component of EPOC (

Børsheim and Bahr, 2003

).

ATP-PC Changes



Figure 3.10
 indicates what happens to ATP and PC levels in muscle during constant-load, supramaximal exercise (105–110% 

) lasting 3 minutes or less. As shown in the figure, the ATP level in the muscle decreases only slightly. In fact, the maximum ATP depletion observed in skeletal muscle after heavy exercise is only about 30–40% in both males and females. Thus, even after exhaustive work, 60–70% of the resting amount of ATP is still present (Cheetham et al., 1986
; Gollnick and King, 1969
).









FIGURE 3.10
 Time Course for the Utilization of PC and ATP and the Accumulation of Lactate in Muscle and Veins.
 Muscle levels of ATP are maintained relatively constant during high-intensity, short-duration exercise at the expense of PC. Muscle lactate levels rise sooner and higher than do venous levels owing to the diffusion time lag and dilution. Source

Conversely, the level of PC changes dramatically. The greatest depletion of PC occurs in the initial 20 seconds of exercise, with the result that ATP is maintained almost at resting levels during that time span. From 20 to 180 seconds, the decline in PC and ATP is both gradual and parallel (

Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973

). Obviously, the ATP level is maintained at the expense of the PC. However, some ATP is also being provided from glycolysis, as indicated by the rise in lactate in both muscle and blood, and an additional amount by oxidation.



Lactate Changes


Lactate levels in response to exercise depend primarily on the intensity of the exercise. Acute exercise produces an increase in both MCT1 and MCT4 with the change being greater in MCT1 than MCT4 (Thomas et al., 2012
). In addition, transmembrane lactate and hydrogen ion gradients increase. Lactate transport is faster in oxidative fibers than in glycolytic ones. The fast transport of lactate by oxidative fibers may reflect lactate’s role as an energy
 substrate, while the slower transport in glycolytic fibers may contribute to a greater retention of lactate during recovery for reconversion into glycogen (Gladden, 2000
).


Short-Term, High-Intensity Anaerobic Exercise



Figure 3.10
 includes both muscle and blood lactate responses to high-intensity, short-duration (3 minutes or less), supramaximal exercise. As the figure shows, muscle lactate levels rise immediately with the onset of such hard work (105–110% 

) and continue to rise throughout the length of the task. Blood lactate values show a similar pattern, if the lag for diffusion time is taken into account. This lactate response (a rapid and consistent accumulation) is representative of what occurs when the exercise bout is greater than 90% 

 (Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973
).


Short- and Long-Term, Light to Moderate Submaximal Aerobic Exercise



Figure 3.11
 depicts what occurs in both short-term and long-term low- to moderate-intensity submaximal aerobic activity. During the first 3–5 minutes of such steady-state work, the lactate (La−
) level rises (Figure 3.11A
). This increase reflects the lactate accumulated during the oxygen deficit (Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973
). Between approximately 5 and 10 minutes, lactate decreases from this elevated point to a stable near resting level and remains there for 30–60 minutes. (Figure 3.11B
). The reason for this result lies in the balance between lactate production (the rate of lactate appearance) and lactate clearance (the rate of lactate disappearance).









FIGURE 3.11
 Lactate Accumulation during Short- and Long-Term Dynamic Aerobic Constant Submaximal Work.
 A.
 During a short bout of constant submaximal work, lactate accumulation increases, but is minimal. B.
 If this submaximal load continues for a long duration the initial rise in lactate accumulation declines slightly, levels off and then remains stable.






Figure 3.12

 shows the results from a study that directly measured the rate of lactate appearance (R
a
) and the rate of lactate disappearance (R
d
) by radioactive tracers as well as the blood levels of lactate concentration ([La
−
]) (

Brooks, 1985

). In the transition from rest to steady-state submaximal exercise, the rate of both lactate appearance and lactate disappearance increased. During the next 30 minutes of exercise, the turnover rate was higher than at rest. The result was an initial increase in [La
−
], which declined after 5 minutes of activity to almost resting levels by 30 minutes. When the workload was increased, the rate of clearance (R
d
) was no longer able to keep up with the rate of production (R
a
), and the lactate concentration in the blood [La
−
] increased sharply.










FIGURE 3.12
 The Impact of the Rates of Lactate Appearance and Disappearance on Lactate Accumulation during Light and Heavy Submaximal Aerobic Exercise.
 During light (700 kgm·min−1
) submaximal aerobic exercise, the rate of lactate disappearance (Rd
) (left y-axis) lags behind the rate of lactate appearance (Ra
) (left y-axis) to a small extent, but then catches up so that the 30-minute lactate concentration [La−
] value (right y-axis) approximates rest. During heavy submaximal exercise (30–45 minutes), the Rd
 lags behind Ra
 and [La−
] increases. Source

Figure 3.13

 shows how lactate level varies with competitive distance (and thus duration) in highly trained male runners. At the shorter distances the predominant energy source is anaerobic, and the anticipated high lactate values occur. As the distance increases and more energy is supplied aerobically, the intensity that can be

 maintained decreases. As a result, lactate also decreases, doing so in a negative exponential curvilinear pattern. By approximately 30 km (18 mi) the lactate levels are almost the same as at rest.

Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Aerobic Exercise


The importance of the intensity of exercise, even at the marathon distance, is illustrated in Figure 3.14
. Two groups of runners were matched according to their 

. One group ran a simulated marathon on the treadmill at 73.3% 

 (in 2 hours 45 minutes or less); the other group ran the same distance but at 64.5% 

 (in 3 hours 45 minutes or slightly less). Within the slow group, blood lactate values remained relatively stable and at a level considered to be within normal resting amounts. The blood lactate levels in the fast group were statistically significantly higher throughout the marathon than were those of the slow group. As absolutes, however, both sets of values were low, with the slow group being within a normal resting range and the fast group only slightly above normal resting levels (O’Brien et al., 1993
).









FIGURE 3.14
 Blood Lactate Accumulation during the Marathon.
 Blood lactate accumulation during a fast marathon (2 hours and 45 minutes or less) was greater than the accumulation during a slow marathon (3 hours and 45 minutes or less). The lactate levels for the slow marathoners never exceeded normal resting levels, and the lactate levels for the fast marathoners barely exceeded normal resting levels. Source

At moderate- to heavy-intensity continuous activity between 50 and 85%
 

 (depending on the individual’s genetic characteristics and training status), lactate levels rise rapidly during the first 5–10 minutes of exercise. If the workload continues for more than 10 minutes, the lactate level may continue to rise, may stabilize, or may decline, depending on the individual and other conditions.




One of these “other conditions” may be the exercise intensity in relation to the individual’s maximal lactate steady state.
 Maximal lactate steady state (MLSS)
 is the highest workload that can be maintained over time without a continual rise in blood lactate; it indicates an exercise intensity above which lactate production exceeds clearance. MLSS is assessed by a series of workloads performed on different days. Each succeeding workload gets progressively harder until the blood lactate accumulation increases more or less steadily throughout the test or increases more than 1 mmol·L
−1
 after the initial rise and establishment of a plateau in the early minutes. Thus, in a 30-minute test, changes in the first 10 minutes are ignored and only the last 20 minutes used to determine if the change is less than or greater than 1 mmol·L
−1
. When the blood lactate concentration meets this criterion, the previous workload that exhibited a plateau in lactate throughout the duration (after the initial rise) is labeled as the MLSS workload. Often the MLSS workload is compared to the individual’s maximal workload and expressed as a percentage known as MLSS intensity. MLSS values between 1.9 and 7.5 mmol·L
−1
, which corresponded to exercise intensities between 54 and 83% of maximal aerobic power, have been reported. MLSS is highly related to
 

 and endurance performance (

Beneke et al., 2011

). Performances at the MLSS

 intensity result in a steady state for lactate for approximately 30–60 minutes; performances below this intensity show declining lactate values, and performances above this level exhibit progressively increasing lactate values. Extensive endurance performance cannot be completed above the MLSS, but portions of the event certainly may be (

Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum



Figure 3.15
 depicts physiological responses during incremental exercise to maximum. Heart rate and oxygen consumption (Figure 3.15A and B
) increase in a rectilinear pattern to meet the increasing demands for energy, but both ventilation and blood lactate (Figure 3.15C and D
) show very little initial change and then increase more sharply. As depicted, this pattern is often described as a rectilinear rise with two breakpoints or thresholds. Alternately, by smoothing these points, the pattern can be described as positively accelerating exponential curves.









FIGURE 3.15
 Ventilatory and Lactate Thresholds during Incremental Work to Maximum.
 Both heart rate (A)
 and O2
 consumption (B)
 increase in direct rectilinear patterns during an incremental work task whether the work is expressed in terms of absolute workload or percentage of 

. In contrast, both ventilation (
) (C)
 and lactate (D)
 appear to exhibit two distinct breakpoints as they rise. The circumstance of VT1 occurring at the same time as LT1 and VT2 occurring at the same time as LT2 is coincidental.





Since the early 1970s, much attention has been paid to a concept that has been labeled variously as the
 anaerobic threshold(s)
, the
 ventilatory threshold(s)
, or the
 lactate threshold(s)
. The original concept of an anaerobic threshold is based on the lactate response to incremental

 exercise, as depicted in
 
Figure 3.15D

, and the relationship of the lactate response to minute ventilation (VsubE, the volume of air breathed each minute,
 
Figure 3.15C

).






Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS)
 The highest workload that can be maintained over time without a continual rise in blood lactate; it indicates an exercise intensity above which lactate production exceeds clearance.



Lactate Thresholds
 Points on the linear-curvilinear continuum of lactate accumulation that appear to indicate sharp rises, often labeled as the first (LT1) and second (LT2) lactate threshold.





As espoused by
 
Wasserman et al. (1973)

, the
 anaerobic threshold
 is defined as the exercise intensity, usually described as a percentage of
 

 or absolute workload, above which blood lactate levels rise and minute ventilation increases disproportionately in relation to oxygen consumption. The onset of anaerobic metabolism (or anaerobiosis), which is assumed to lead to the lactate accumulation, is attributed to the failure of the cardiovascular system to supply the oxygen required to the muscle tissue. The disproportionate rise in ventilation is attributed to excess carbon dioxide resulting from the buffering of the lactic acid (

Jones and Ehrsam, 1982

;
 
Wasserman and McIlroy, 1964

).




Theoretically, these interactions can occur as follows: lactic acid is a strong acid, and as noted earlier in this chapter, it readily dissociates into hydrogen ions (H
+
) and lactate. Because excess hydrogen ions would change the pH (or acid-base balance) of the muscles and blood, the body attempts to bind these hydrogen ions to a chemical buffer. For example, sodium bicarbonate (a weak base) may be used as a buffer in the reaction:








Carbonic acid is a much weaker acid than LA and can be further dissociated into water and carbon dioxide:








Carbon dioxide is a potent stimulant for respiration and can easily be removed from the body through respiration, thereby assisting in the maintenance of pH (

Pitts, 1974

). The carbon dioxide thus formed is said to be
 nonmetabolic carbon dioxide
, since it does not result from the immediate breakdown of an energy substrate (carbohydrate, fat, or protein).





Figure 3.15

 clearly shows distinct breaks from linearity in respiration (

Figure 3.15C

) despite a continuous rectilinear rise in heart rate (

Figure 3.15A

) and oxygen consumption (

Figure 3.15B

) during incremental work to maximum. These breakpoints (

Figure 3.15C

) have been labeled VT1 (the first ventilatory threshold) and VT2 (the second ventilatory threshold). They were originally thought to result from corresponding lactate thresholds (labeled in
 
Figure 3.15D

 as LT1 and LT2 for the first and second lactate threshold) as a result of the buffering of lactic acid. The original work by Wasserman and others postulated only one anaerobic threshold (which would have been VT1 in
 
Figure 3.16C

), but later work identified at least two thresholds, which were given various names (

Carey et al., 2010

;
 
Jacobs, 1986

;
 
Reinhard et al., 1979

;
 
Skinner and McLellan, 1980

). The designations VT1 and VT2 and LT1 and LT2 are used in this text for simplicity and because no causal mechanism is implied.

The idea that the point of lactate accumulation can be determined noninvasively by respiratory values typically measured during laboratory exercise testing of oxygen consumption is appealing, since few people enjoy having a catheter inserted or multiple blood samples taken. However, the terminology, determination, and mechanistic explanations are not without controversy (

Walsh and Banister, 1988

). Four concerns have been raised, as described below.




The primary concern is that the presence of lactate does not automatically mean that the oxygen supply is inadequate (

Gladden, 2004

;
 
Hughes et al., 1982

). This fact was discussed in detail earlier in this chapter. Lactate accumulation occurs not at the time of increased production but when the turnover rate (or balance between production and removal) cannot keep up and appearance exceeds clearance.





Figure 3.16A

 shows this concept graphically for incremental exercise. That is, as the exercise and oxygen consumption increase, the rate of lactate appearance (
R
a
) in the muscle does also (

Figure 3.16B

). At low-intensity exercise, the rate of lactate disappearance (
R
d
) does not

 differ much from
 R
a
. However, as the intensity increases, the gap between
 R
a
 and
 R
d
 grows progressively wider. The result is the blood lactate concentration [La
−
] depicted in
 
Figure 3.16A

. Thus, it is incorrect to consider the appearance of elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood an anaerobic threshold. Rather it is a lactate threshold that represents the point at which the metabolic clearance of lactate becomes limited (

Messonnier et al., 2013

).




A second concern is exactly how to interpret the lactate response to incremental work. Look closely at the lactate pattern in
 
Figure 3.15

 and recall that this pattern can be described as either a rectilinear rise with two breakpoints, or thresholds (

Skinner and McLellan, 1980

), or as an exponential curve (

Hughson et al., 1987

). Experimental evidence and mathematical models (

Hughson et al., 1987

) support the curvilinear interpretation. Nevertheless, the term
 lactate threshold
 continues to be used to indicate marked increases in the accumulation of lactate. The ventilatory thresholds are always considered to be true breakpoints.




A third concern involves carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is involved in the control of respiration (see
 
Chapter 9

). An excess of hydrogen ions from a source such as lactic acid can cause an increased amount of carbon dioxide through the bicarbonate buffering system described earlier. However, the presence of lactic acid is not the only mechanism that can account for the increased carbon dioxide or the concomitant increase in minute ventilation (

Inbar and Bar-Or, 1986

). Evidence is particularly strong in McArdle’s syndrome patients. McArdle’s syndrome patients are deficient in the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which is necessary for breaking down glycogen, which can ultimately be converted to lactic acid. Thus, no matter how hard these patients exercise, their lactic acid values remain negligible. On the other hand, their minute ventilation values have the same distinctive breakpoints shown by anyone not deficient in glycogen phosphorylase (

Hagberg et al., 1982

). Recent evidence by
 
Péronnet and Aguilaniu (2006)

 has shown that the decrease in bicarbonate concentration is not the mirror image of the increase in lactate concentration. These researchers believe that the disproportionate increase in
 

 is due to hyperventilation and low plasma pH—not that the hyperventilation is due to the increased CO
2
.




A fourth concern is that the lactate thresholds and the ventilatory thresholds do not change to the same extent in the same individuals as a result of training, glycogen depletion, caffeine ingestion, and/or varying pedaling rates (

Hughes et al., 1982

;
 
Poole and Gaesser, 1985

). If they were causally linked, they should change together.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






The Impact of Dehydration on the Lactate Threshold






Seven collegiate female rowers participated in two incremental exercise bouts to maximum on a cycle ergometer. One trial (hydrated state) was preceded the night before by a 45-minute submaximal ride at a heart rate of 130–150 b·min−1
 during which the participants were allowed unlimited access to fluid. The other trial (dehydrated state) consisted of the same submaximal exercise, but the participants performed in a full sweat suit and were denied fluid until after the incremental test the next morning. See the table for results.







Despite only a mild dehydration—associated with a net drop of 1.5% in body weight—a statistically significant (
P
 < 0.05) shift did occur in the lactate threshold, defined as the first lactate threshold (LT1), to a lower percentage of peak oxygen consumption. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in work performance in terms of both power output and time to exhaustion. However, nonsignificant differences were attained for maximal heart rate, oxygen consumption, and lactate. Thus, it appears that dehydration (or the failure to rehydrate adequately after exercise) alters the relative contributions of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism to an external workload and negatively affects performance. Guidelines for hydration are presented in
 
Chapters 6

 and
 
14

. The effects of dehydration on cardiovascular responses to exercise are detailed in
 
Chapter 14

.

*P
 < 0.05.







Current theory, therefore, concludes that although lactic acid increases and ventilatory breaks or thresholds often occur simultaneously, these responses are due to coincidence, not cause and effect (

Brooks, 1985

;
 
Walsh and Banister, 1988

).




Despite a lack of complete understanding of the lactate threshold, the amount of work an athlete can do

 before accumulating large amounts of lactate has a definite bearing on performance. Distance running performance, for example, depends to a large extent on some combination of
 

, the oxygen cost of running at a given submaximal speed (called economy), and the ability to run at a high percentage of
 

 without a large accumulation of lactate (

Costill et al., 1973

;
 
Farrell et al., 1979

;
 
Kinderman et al., 1979

). An indication of the running speed that represents the optimal percentage of
 

 can be achieved by determining the lactate thresholds. The first lactate threshold (LT1) generally occurs between 40 and 60% of
 

; the second lactate threshold (LT2) is generally over 80% of
 

 and possibly as high as 95% of
 

. LT1 is sometimes equated with a lactate concentration of 2 mmol·L
−1
, and LT2 with a lactate concentration of 4 mmol·L
−1
, but these values may or may not coincide for any given individual. This 4 mmol·L
−1
 level, also called the
 onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA)
, is frequently used to decide both training loads and racing strategies (

Hermansen et al., 1975

;
 
Jacobs, 1986

).




The relationship between the various lactate thresholds determined during an incremental exercise test and the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) described earlier is variable and largely based on testing modality, protocol and training status of the participants. Although sometimes not statistically different, typically MLSS is slightly lower than LT2 or OBLA. The techniques should not be used interchangeably to determine training prescriptions (

Beneke, 1995

;
 
de Souza et al., 2012

;
 
Klusiewicz, 2005

;
 
Svedahl and MacIntosh, 2003

).



Dynamic Resistance Exercise


Lactate responses to dynamic resistance exercise vary greatly because of the many different possible combinations of exercises, repetitions, sets, and rest periods, In addition, samples are generally not taken repeatedly during the workout; instead, the most frequently reported values are only postexercise. In general, postexercise lactate values have been shown to range from approximately 4–21 mmol·L−1
. The higher values result from high-volume, moderate-load, short rest period sequences and circuit-type exercise bouts (Bangsbo et al., 1994
; Burleson et al., 1998
; Keul et al., 1978
; Reynolds et al., 1997
; Tesch, 1992
). Concentric contractions elicit higher lactate responses than do eccentric contractions (Durand et al., 2003
). Resistance programs designed to increase strength primarily through hypertrophy (increased muscle size) produce greater lactate responses than do those designed to increase strength primarily through neural adaptation or dynamic power programs (Crewther et al., 2006
).




Table 3.3

 summarizes the anaerobic metabolic exercise responses discussed in this section.




TABLE 3.3
 Lactic Anaerobic Exercise Response






Why Is Lactic Acid Accumulation a Problem?


It is the hydrogen ions (H+
) that dissociate from lactic acid, rather than undissociated lactic acid or lactate (La−
), that present the primary (but not only) problems to the body. This distinction is important, because at normal pH levels, 99% of the lactic acid is dissociated immediately to H+
 and La−
 (C3
H5
O3
−
) (Brooks, 1985
; Gladden, 2004
). As long as the amount of free H+
 does not exceed the ability of the chemical and physiological mechanisms to buffer them and maintain the pH at a relatively stable level, there are few problems. Most problems arise when the amount of lactic acid—and thus H+
—exceeds the body’s immediate buffering capacity and the pH decreases (Gladden, 2004
). The blood has become more acidic. At that point, pain is perceived and performance suffers. The mechanisms of these results are as follows.


Pain


Anyone who has raced or run the 400-m distance all out understands the pain associated with lactic acid production. The 400-m run takes between approximately 45 seconds and 3 minutes (depending on the ability of the runner) and relies heavily on the ATP-PC and LA systems to supply the needed energy. The resultant hydrogen ions accumulate and stimulate pain nerve endings in the muscle (Hall, 2016
).


Performance Decrement


The decrement in performance associated with lactic acid results from fatigue that is metabolic and possibly muscular in origin
.


METABOLIC FATIGUE Metabolic fatigue results from a reduced production of ATP linked to enzyme changes, changes in membrane transport mechanisms, and changes in substrate availability.



Enzymes—in particular, the rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolic pathways—can be inactivated by high hydrogen ion concentrations (low pH). The hydrogen ion attaches to these enzyme molecules and in so doing changes their size and shape and thus their ability to function. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is thought to be particularly sensitive, although oxidative enzymes can also be affected (

Hultman and Sahlin, 1980

).




At the same time, changes occur in membrane transport mechanisms (either to the carriers in the membrane or to the permeability channels). These changes affect the movement of molecules across the cell membrane and between the cytoplasm and organelles such as the mitochondria (

Hultman and Sahlin, 1980

).




Energy substrate availability can be inhibited by a high concentration of hydrogen ions. Glycogen breakdown is slowed by the inactivation of the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. Fatty acid utilization is decreased because lactic acid inhibits mobilization. Thus, a double-jeopardy situation occurs. With fatty acid availability low, a greater reliance is placed on carbohydrate sources at the time when glycogen breakdown is inhibited. At the same time, phosphocreatine breakdown is accelerated, leading to a faster depletion of substrate for ATP regeneration (

Åstrand et al, 2003

;
 
Davis, 1985

;
 
Hultman and Sahlin, 1980

;
 
Rooney and Trayhurn, 2011

).




Thus, both the inactivation of enzymes and the decrement in substrate availability will lead to a reduction in the production of ATP and, ultimately, a decrement in performance.



MUSCULAR FATIGUE Muscular fatigue is evidenced by reduced force and velocity of muscle contraction. The contraction of skeletal muscle and the influence of lactic acid on muscular fatigue are detailed in Chapters 17
 and 18
, respectively. Suffice it to say here that the idea that lactic acidosis directly and only negatively affects the contractile elements of muscle and force/velocity production has been largely abandoned (Meyer and Wiseman, 2012
). Recent studies question the role of lactic acid in muscular fatigue, even to the point of considering changes brought about by lactate and acidosis during exercise to be beneficial. That is, it is unclear whether lactate is a causative or a preventive agent of muscle fatigue (Bangsbo, 2006
; Gladden, 2008b
; Lamb, 2006
; Lindinger, 2011
; Robergs et al., 2004
). While the controversy remains, what is certain is that although lactate/H+
 may contribute to fatigue, lactic acid is not the sole cause of muscular fatigue (Bangsbo, 2006
; Cairns, 2006
; Lamb, 2006
).


Time Frame for Lactate Removal Postexercise


Lactate is removed from the bloodstream relatively rapidly following exercise (Gollnick et al., 1986
). However, removal does not occur at a constant rate. If it did, then higher levels of lactate would take proportionately longer to dissipate than would lower levels. By analogy, if you do one push-up in 2 seconds and you couldn’t change that rate or speed, then 10 push-ups would take twice as long to do as 5 push-ups (20 vs. 10 seconds). On the other hand, if you could change the rate, you might do 10 in the same time as you did 5 (in 10 seconds). Many chemical reactions have this ability to change the rate or speed at which they occur. The rate is proportional to the amount of substrate and product present. The more substrate available and the less product, the faster the reaction proceeds, and vice versa. This characteristic is called the mass action effect
. Lactate appears to be one of those substrates whose utilization and conversion are linked with the amount of substrate present (Bonen et al., 1979
).



Thus, despite wide differences among individuals (which may be related to muscle fiber type), in a resting recovery situation approximately half of the lactate is removed in about 15–25 minutes regardless of the starting level. This time is called the
 half-life of lactate
. Near-resting levels are achieved in about 30–60 minutes, regardless of the starting level. Thus, the initial postexercise concentration of lactate is the first factor that influences the rate of removal. The higher the concentration, the faster is the rate of removal (

Bonen et al., 1979

;
 
Hermansen and Stensvold, 1972

;
 
Hogan et al., 1995

).





Figure 3.17

 shows typical resting recovery curves from cycling and running studies. Note that in each case the value close to 50% (shown in parentheses) of the initial postexercise lactate levels occurs between 15 and 25 minutes of recovery.










FIGURE 3.17
 The Time Course of Lactate Removal during Resting Recovery from Exercise.
 During resting recovery from exercise, lactate exhibits a half-life of 15–25 minutes. Sources:
 Based on data from Bonen et al. (1979)
; Belcastro and Bonen (1975)
; Bonen and Belcastro (1976)
; McGrail et al. (1978)
.





The second factor that determines the rate of lactate removal is whether the individual follows a rest (passive) recovery or an exercise (active) recovery regimen. Third, with exercise recovery, the intensity of the exercise (expressed as a percentage of 

) makes a difference. Fourth, the modality of the exercise used in the recovery phase may influence the optimal percentage of 

 at which removal occurs. And finally, whether the recovery exercise is continuous or intermittent seems to make a difference.



Evidence suggests that lactate removal occurs more quickly when an individual exercises during recovery than when he or she sits quietly (

Bangsbo et al., 1994

).
 
Figure 3.18

 shows the results of a study conducted by
 
Bonen and Belcastro (1976)

. Six trained runners completed a mile run on three different occasions. In randomized order, they then performed three different 20-minute recoveries: (1) seated rest, (2) continuous jogging at a self-selected pace, and (3) self-selected active recovery. During self-selected active recovery, the subjects did calisthenics, walked, jogged, and rested for variable portions of the total time.










FIGURE 3.18
 Lactate Removal in Active versus Passive Recovery.
 Lactate removal is faster under active than passive conditions, although the magnitude of the benefit of active recovery depends on the type and intensity of the activity. In this study, continuous jogging at 61.4% 

 was more effective than was a mixture of walking, jogging, and calisthenics. Source

As shown in
 
Figure 3.18

, after 5 minutes there is no appreciable difference in the level of lactate among the different recovery protocols. However, over the next 15 minutes, the rate of lactate removal was significantly faster for the jogging recovery than for either the self-selected active recovery or the rest recovery. The self-selected activity (what athletes typically do at a track meet), although not as good as continuous jogging (in part because it was intermittent), was still significantly better than was resting recovery.




After 20 minutes of jogging recovery, the lactate that remained was within the normal resting levels of 1–2 mmol·L
−1
. The self-selected active recovery had removed 70% of the lactate, but the resting recovery had only removed 50% of the lactate. Thus, full recovery was, and generally is, delayed with seated rest. Because athletes who run distances from 400 to 1,500 m (or the English equivalents of 440 yd to 1 mi) often double at track meets, such a delay could impair their performances in the second event. Based on these results, athletes competing or training at distances that are likely to cause large accumulations of lactate should cool down with an active continuous recovery.




Why does activity increase the rate of lactate removal? The rate of lactate removal by the liver appears to be the same whether an individual is resting or exercising. However, during exercise, blood flow is increased, as is the oxidation of lactate by skeletal and cardiac muscles (

Bangsbo et al., 1994

;
 
Belcastro and Bonen, 1975

;
 
Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973

;
 
Hogan et al., 1995

;
 
McGrail et al., 1978

). These changes appear to be primarily responsible for the beneficial effects of an active recovery.




At what intensity should an active recovery be performed? Studies have found an inverted U-shaped response (

Belcastro and Bonen, 1975

;
 
Hogan et al., 1995

;
 
Dotan et al., 2000

). That is, up to a point, a higher intensity of exercise (as measured by percentage of
 

) during recovery is better. But after that point, as the intensity continues to rise, the removal rate decreases. The optimal rate for recovery from cycle ergometry for both children and adults is between 29 and 45% of
 

. Data from track and treadmill exercises show the same type of inverted U-shaped curve response, but in the 55–70%
 

 range (

Belcastro and Bonen, 1975

;
 
Hogan et al., 1995

). This difference in optimal intensity may be a function of the modality (there is a higher static component for the cycle ergometer than for running) or of the training status of the subjects tested.




The actual value of these optimal percentages should not be surprising. The LT1 has been shown to occur between 40 and 60% of
 

 and may be higher in trained individuals. Thus, it appears that the optimal intensity for recovery would be just below an individual’s first lactate threshold, where lactate production is minimal but clearance is maximized. Direct measurement of lactate clearance when recovery intensity was set according to % LT1 has confirmed this (

Devlin et al., 2014

;
 
Menzies et al., 2010

). The rate of blood lactate clearance exhibits a dose-response relationship during active recovery. Active recovery intensities at 80–100% of LT were more effective than exercise intensities at 60, 40, or 0% LT. In the Menzies 2010 study, although there was a wide variation, in general, study participants self-selected a recovery intensity very close to the 80% LT value, so self-regulation may be possible for many individuals

.




Conversely both deep and superficial massage and passive static stretching have been found to be ineffective for accelerating the rate of blood lactate clearance after exercise and may, indeed, impede it. The cause is likely related to the mechanical pressure exerted during the massage and intramuscular pressure during stretching as well as an elongation of the blood vessels running parallel to the muscle fibers—all of which result in a reduction of blood flow (

Cè et al., 2013

;
 
Wiltshire et al., 2010

).




One word of caution: Although active recovery is best for lactate removal, it can delay glycogen resynthesis by further depleting glycogen stores (

Choi et al., 1994

). This has more relevance for an individual attempting to recover from a hard interval-training session than for someone just completing a middle-distance race and preparing for another. Glycogen depletion is likely to be more severe in the former case, and removing lactate quickly is a more immediate concern in the latter case. For athletes recovering from an interval training session or competing in heats on successive days, the best procedure may be to utilize an initial dynamic active recovery (just to the point of regaining a near-resting heart rate) and then engage in a passive recovery during which carbohydrates are consumed.





Male versus Female Anaerobic Exercise Characteristics




The anaerobic characteristics of females are generally lower than are those of males in the young and middle-aged adult years. Much of the difference is undoubtedly related to the smaller overall muscle mass of the average female compared with that of the average male (Wells, 1991
).


The Availability and Utilization of ATP-PC


Neither the local resting stores of ATP per kilogram of muscle nor the utilization of ATP-PC during exercise varies between the sexes (Brooks, 1986
; Gollnick et al., 1986
; Kappenstein et al., 2013
; Willcocks et al., 2014
). However, in terms of total energy available from these phosphagen sources, males will have more than females because of muscle mass differences.


The Accumulation of Lactate


Resting levels of lactate are the same for males and females. Lactate thresholds, when expressed as a percentage of
 

, are also the same for both sexes, although the absolute workload at which the lactate thresholds occur is higher for males than females. Thus, at any given absolute workload that is still submaximal but above LT1 or LT2, females have a higher lactate value than do males. Consequently, the workload is more stressful for females and requires a greater anaerobic contribution. However, at a given relative workload or percentage of 

 above the lactate thresholds, lactate concentrations are equal for both sexes (Wells, 1991
). The [La−
] at maximal steady state (MLSS) is not influenced by sex (Smekal et al., 2012
).



Lactate values at maximal exercise from ages 16 through 50 are higher by approximately 0.5–2.0 mmol·L
−1
 for males than for females (see
 
Figure 3.19

). Once again, females are generally doing less in terms of an absolute workload than were males at maximum.

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Exercise, Lactic Acid, and Lactation






The impact of the accumulation of lactic acid/lactate [HLa] following exercise on infants’ acceptance of postexercise breast milk is an area of special interest. Some of the lactate present in the blood diffuses into breast milk.







In 1991, Wallace and Rabin reported that the concentration of lactic acid in breast milk following maximal treadmill exercise increased from 0.79 mmol·L
−1
 preexercise to 1.62 mmol·L
−1
 postexercise and remained elevated for at least 30 minutes. This milk [HLa] was approximately 25% of the postexercise blood concentration. Infants’ acceptance of the postexercise milk was not tested in this study, but the investigators speculated that because these levels were high enough to change the taste of the breast milk, this could be a problem. Infants have fully developed taste buds at birth and can detect sour tastes such as that produced by lactic acid.








A follow-up study (

Wallace et al., 1992

) again revealed elevated postmaximal-exercise milk [HLa] (2.84 mmol·L
−1
 at 10 minutes and 2.97 mmol·L
−1
 at 30 minutes). Infants were fed 2 mL of the pre- and two postexercise milk samples in a randomized fashion through a medicine dropper. Mothers’ ratings of their infants’ acceptance of the milk were significantly lower for both postexercise samples than the preexercise sample.








Reasoning that nursing mothers typically would not be doing maximal exercise,
 
Quinn and Carey (1999)

 compared three exercise intensities on three separate days (maximal, at LT1, and 20% below LT1 abbreviated as LT1-20) to a resting control trial. Mothers were divided into two groups based on controlled carbohydrate intakes of 63 or 52% of total caloric intake. Breast milk [HLa] was significantly increased immediately after maximal exercise (1.27 and 1.52 mmol·L
−1
) and LT1 exercise (0.19 and 0.25 mmol·L
−1
), but not after the LT1-20 exercise (0.11 and 0.12 mmol·L
−1
). Only the level following maximal exercise remained elevated 30 minutes after exercise.








More recently,
 
Wright et al. (2002)

 tested the impact of maximal- and moderate-(LT1-20) intensity exercise compared to a resting control session on acceptance of postexercise breast milk by infants in a well-designed, controlled experiment. As in the prior research, breast milk [HLa] was significantly elevated over the control condition after maximal exercise (0.21 vs. 0.09 mmol·L
−1
) but not after the moderate-intensity exercise. Infants were offered the posttesting milk in a bottle. The mother and three lactation consultants (via videotape) rated the infants’ acceptance of the milk. Both the mothers and the lactation consultants judged no differences in the infants’ milk acceptance. Infants consumed an average of 104 mL of milk at the feedings.








These results seem to indicate that moderate exercise and lactation are compatible and that nursing mothers can enjoy the benefits of both for themselves and for their infants. Indeed, a 1994 study (

Dewey et al., 1994

) demonstrated fitness benefits for lactating women participating in a moderate submaximal aerobic exercise program (60–70% HRR progressing from 20 to 45 min·d
−1
, 5 d·wk
−1
 for 12 weeks). Although not a primary interest in this study, these researchers reported that none of these mothers mentioned any difficulties with nursing after exercise.

Mechanical Power and Capacity


As previously mentioned, on average males produce higher absolute work output than do females. Data available from the WAnT show that values for peak power for women are approximately 65% of values for men if expressed in watts, improve to 83% if expressed in watts per kilogram of body weight, and come close to being equal at 94% when expressed in watts per kilogram of lean body mass. The corresponding comparisons for mean power are 68, 87, and 98%, respectively. The peak power of women (in watts per kilogram of body weight) is very similar to the mean power of men. The fatigue index does not show a significant sex difference, indicating that both sexes tire at the same rate (Kappenstein et al., 2013
; Makrides et al., 1985
). It has been shown that females provide a relatively higher portion of the energy for the WAnT aerobically than do males. This may mean that the total power output during a WAnT actually underestimates the sex difference in anaerobic capacity between males and females (Hill and Smith, 1993
).



The maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) is significantly higher in males than females (

Hill, and Vingren, 2014

;
 
Weber and Schneider, 2000

).





Anaerobic Exercise Characteristics of Children




The anaerobic characteristics of children are not as well developed as those of adults. Furthermore, children tend not to exhibit metabolic specialization as adults do. For example, one would not expect Usain Bolt (the 2009 world record holder in the 100-m dash, with a time of 9.58) to do well at the marathon distance, nor Paula Radcliffe (who set the women’s marathon world best at 2:15:25 in 2003) to be successful at the sprint distances. Yet watch children at play (Figure 3.20
) and, more often than not, the fastest at short distances or strength-type events also do well at long distances or in aerobic-type games such as soccer. At the same time, children naturally seem to preferentially participate in intermittent, high-intensity, short-duration activities. Although more research is needed to explain the anaerobic differences between children and adults, some patterns are apparent (Bar-Or, 1983
; Rowland, 2005
).









FIGURE 3.20
 Children Sprinting, an Anaerobic Activity.




The Availability and Utilization of ATP-PC


Local resting stores of ATP per kilogram of wet muscle weight appear to be the same for children and adults (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
; Rowland, 2005
). Levels
 of resting PC per kilogram of wet muscle weight have been reported as slightly lower in children (Bar-Or, 1983
; Shephard, 1982
) or no different from adult levels (Eriksson, 1972
; Shephard, 1982
). At the onset of high-intensity intermittent exercise, a higher portion of the ATP demand is provided by oxidative ATP formation by children compared with adults, giving children a clear advantage in the transition from rest to exercise. This means that the decrease in PC is lower in children and adolescents than adults during fatiguing high-intensity exercise. Because children initially use less PC, they can start the next repetition with a higher PC level than can adults (Kappenstein et al., 2013
; Willcocks et al., 2014
). Finally, children have been shown to have faster or similar intramuscular PC restoration and recovery half-times after exercise than do adults (Falk and Dotan, 2006
; Kappenstein et al., 2013
; Willcocks et al., 2014
).


The Accumulation of Lactate


On the average, blood lactate values obtained during submaximal exercise and after maximal exercise are lower in children than in adults (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
; Rowland, 1990
, 2005
; Shephard, 1982
; Van Praagh, 2007
). Furthermore, peak lactate values after maximal exercise exhibit a relatively positive rectilinear increase with age until adulthood. This increase can be as much as 50% for boys between the ages of 6 and 14 years and slightly less for girls (Rowland, 2005
). Figure 3.19
 depicts children’s values. It also shows that there is no meaningful sex difference in children in the accumulation of lactate, although the girls’ values are slightly higher than the boys’ values throughout the growth period. Anatomical differences between children and adults allow for a faster transition time for metabolites (La−
, H+
) from the muscle to blood; thus, [La−
] peaks sooner after exercise in children than in adults. However, the rate of elimination (the time for half-life disappearance of La−
) is the same in children, adolescents, and adults. The lower lactate levels in children and adolescents are also reflected in higher pH levels during intense exercise although there is no difference in resting muscle pH between children and adults. Children appear to recover from physical exertion more quickly than do adults, in large part because their lower maximal power output means they have less to recover from. However, the early peak of lactate is also a major advantage over adults in recovery. As a consequence, children and adolescents may require shorter rest periods between high-intensity bouts of activity (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
; Falk and Dotan, 2006
; Kappenstein et al., 2013
).


The Lactate Threshold(s)


The phenomenon of ventilatory breakpoints and lactate thresholds is seen in children as well as in adults, but they typically occur at a higher % 

 than for adults (Gaisl and Buchberger, 1979
; Klentrou et al., 2006
; Rowland, 2005
). Because children do not utilize anaerobic metabolism as early in work as adults do, the work level of children at the fixed lactate levels of 4 mmol·L−1
 is relatively higher than that of adults (Kanaley and Boileau, 1988
; Reybrouck, 1989
). Williams et al. (1990)
 report a value of almost 92% of 

 for 4 mmol·L−1
 of lactate in 11- to 13-year-old boys and girls. Values for adults tend to be about 15% below this value. Thus, children are working relatively harder (at a higher % 

) than adults at the same lactate level. Consequently, the assessment of exercise capacity and the monitoring of training by a 4 mmol·L−1
 value is inappropriate in prepubertal children. MLSS (mmol·L−1
) is independent of age and sex between children and adults despite the fact that the MLSS workload is significantly higher in adults than in children (Beneke et al., 2009
).


Mechanical Power and Capacity


Peak power and peak power per kilogram of body weight have consistently been shown to be lower in prepubertal boys and girls than in adolescents or young adults when evaluated by the Margaria-Kalamen Stair Climb test. The results are similar to those for the Wingate Anaerobic Test, although information is lacking about females for the Wingate Anaerobic Test except for isolated ages (10–13 years) (Armstrong et al., 1997
, 2000
; Beneke et al., 2007
; Chia et al., 1999
) (Figure 3.21
). In boys, peak power and mean power increase consistently from age 10 year to young adulthood. This is true both in absolute terms (watts) and when corrected for body weight (watts per kilogram). The absolute differences between children and adults, however, are much greater (children can achieve only about 30% of adult values) than the relative differences (children can achieve about 60–85% of the adult values). Peak values seem to occur in the late thirties for the legs and the late twenties for the arms (Bar-Or, 1988
; Hughson et al., 1987
).

Data are available to compare boys and girls on peak power from a variation of an all-out cycle ergometer test called the force-velocity test

 (

Martin et al., 2004

;
 
Santos et al., 2002

,
 
2003

). The results of the most comprehensive study in terms of age range are shown in
 
Figure 3.22

. These results indicate that from ages 7 to 16 girls increased peak power by 273% and then plateaued between ages 16 and 17. Boys’ peak power increased by 375% between ages 7 and 17. Sex differences were not apparent in peak power until age 14 (

Martin et al., 2004

).










FIGURE 3.22
 Peak Power by Age in Boys and Girls.
 Force-velocity test results indicate that both boys and girls increase the production of PP from 7 to approximately 17 years of age. Sex differences are not apparent until age 14, when boys’ PP production increased more than did girls’. Source:

Fatigue resistance to high-intensity intermittent exercise (maximal knee flexion and extension) shows a gradual decline from childhood through adolescence to young adulthood in males. In females, fatigue resistance declines from childhood to adolescence, but plateaus from there to young adulthood (

Dipla et al., 2009

).



Mechanisms


Several theories, described in the following sections, have been postulated to explain children’s inability to function at a high level anaerobically in activities lasting 15 seconds to 2 minutes and/or requiring large power outputs. These theories are based on two assumptions: that the children tested did indeed put forth a maximal effort and that there is a physiological cause for the observed differences.


The Muscle Enzyme Theory



Eriksson (1972)
 and others have shown that phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in 11- to 13-year-old boys is 2.5–3 times lower than in trained or sedentary adult men. Since PFK is a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, this lowered activity may indicate a decreased ability to produce lactic acid. In addition, the availability and the utilization of glycogen as a substrate, as well as the activity of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), are both lower
 in children than in adults. Studies have shown that the glycogen content of children’s muscles is approximately 50–60% that of adults (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
). Anaerobic enzymes evolve with pubertal maturation, however, and by 12–14 years of age LDH activity has reached adult levels (Berg et al., 1986
). Therefore, it appears that prepubertal youngsters do have lower glycolytic enzyme activity than do fully mature individuals (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
; Rowland, 2005
).



In general, the oxidative enzymes show higher activity in young children than in older individuals (

Berg et al., 1986

;
 
Williams et al., 1990

). This result, along with higher mitochondrial density and intracellular lipids, means that lipid utilization is greater in children. Thus, it may be that children have a finer balance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism than do adults. Additional evidence for this observation comes from the fact that children show a lower oxygen deficit and reach a steady state faster than do adults (

Åstrand, 1952

;
 
Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000

;
 
Reybrouck, 1989

;
 
Rowland, 2005

;
 
Shephard, 1982

).



Muscle Characteristics Theory


Several muscle characteristics have been suggested as explanations for the lower glycolytic anaerobic function in children and adolescents than adults. These include muscle fiber differentiation, muscle fiber recruitment, contractile properties, muscle fiber size, muscle size, and muscle mass (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
; Falk and Dotan, 2006
; Van Praagh, 2000
, 2007
).



The development of muscle fiber-type distribution continues from birth to approximately 6 years of age, when the individual achieves his or her profile of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers. However, the relative proportion of fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG) and fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) fibers continues to change through late adolescence. Typically, FOG fibers predominate more than do FG fibers during childhood and adolescence. Boys develop greater FG cross-sectional area than do girls as they mature. The contractile properties of FG fibers favor force and power expression. Children may be limited in their ability to recruit FG fibers.




Muscle fiber size, measured as diameter, and muscle size, measured as cross-sectional area, both increase rectilinearly with age from birth to young adulthood. Muscle force changes closely parallel changes in cross-sectional area, and these power changes during growth favor boys over girls after puberty. However, when normalized for muscle cross-sectional area, age and sex differences in muscle force disappear.




Finally, total muscle mass is directly related to the ability to generate force/power. As the child grows, obviously so does his or her total muscle mass. However, even normalized for muscle mass, force production is lower in children and adolescents than adults (

Van Praagh, 2000

). Body composition changes (more total muscle mass, less fat for boys) favor males in force production (

Armstrong et al., 1997

).



Sexual Maturation Theory


Limited evidence suggests that the increase in glycolytic capacity (and thus the production of lactate) in children is related to the hormonal changes that bring about sexual maturation. In particular, testosterone is thought to have a role, but research evidence has not been definitive (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
; Rowland, 2005
; Williams et al., 1990
).


Neurohormonal Regulation Theory


It has been shown that sympathoadrenal system activity is significantly lower in children than in adults at maximal exercise (Boisseau and Delamarche, 2000
). Epinephrine is a potent stimulator of muscle glycolysis. Another result of sympathetic stimulation during exercise is hepatic vasoconstriction. The liver plays a major role in the clearance of lactate. If blood flow to the liver is reduced, less lactate is cleared. Thus, because the child maintains a higher liver blood flow, more lactate can be cleared. This implies that children are not deficient in the production of lactate but are, instead, better able to remove or reconvert it than adults (Berg and Keul, 1988
; Mácek and Vávra, 1985
; Rowland, 1990
, 2005
).



Which of these theories—muscle enzyme, muscle characteristics, sexual maturation, neurohormonal regulation—or which combination of them is correct remains to be shown.





Anaerobic Exercise Characteristics of Older Adults




Detailed evidence of the anaerobic characteristics of older adults is scarce, undoubtedly in part because of caution by researchers and in part because of the uncertain motivation of subjects facing high-intensity exercise. The available data indicate that anaerobic variables show a common aging pattern; that is, there is a peak in the second or third decade and then a gradual decline into the sixth decade. One must always remember when interpreting aging results, however, that no one knows how much of this reduction results directly from aging, how much results from detraining accompanying the reduced activity of the elderly, and how much results from disease. Despite this, older adults can still participate successfully in basically anaerobic activities (Figure 3.23
).









FIGURE 3.23
 Older Adult Engaged in Anaerobic Activity.
 Anaerobic metabolic processes function less effectively in older individuals than in younger adults, but participation in anaerobic sports such as throwing the discus can still be enjoyed.




The Availability and Utilization of ATP-PC


Local resting stores of ATP-PC are reduced and levels of creatine and ADP are elevated in muscles of older adults (Kanaley and Boileau, 1988
). Results from the Margaria-Kalamen Stair Climb test have shown a reduction in ATP-PC power of as much as 45% and a reduction in ATP-PC capacity of 32% from youth to old age (Shephard, 1982
). This means that ATP-PC stores are both reduced and unable to be used as quickly. The result is a decrease in alactic anaerobic power
.


The Accumulation of Lactate


On the average, resting levels of blood lactate are remarkably consistent across the entire age span, varying only from 1 to 2 mmol·L−1
.



Lactate values during the same absolute submaximal work tend to be higher in individuals over the age of 50 (

Åstrand, 1960

;
 
Åstrand, 1952

,
 
1956

;
 
Robinson, 1938

). However, this generalization is confounded by the fact that at any given absolute load of work, the older individual is working at a higher percentage of his or her maximal aerobic power, which would be expected to involve more anaerobic metabolism (

Sidney and Shephard, 1977

). When younger and older individuals work at the same relative workload (%
 

), lactate concentrations are lower in older people than in the young, probably because the elderly are using less muscle mass to do less work (

Kohrt et al., 1993

).




Maximal lactate levels as a result of incremental dynamic exercise to maximum reach a peak between 16 and 39 years of age and then show a gradual decline (see
 
Figure 3.19

). Both males and females exhibit the same pattern, although the absolute values of females are considerably lower than are those of males.




Direct measurement of ATP produced from anaerobic glycolysis indicates that older males have an overall lower production than do younger males (

Lanza et al., 2005

) during 60 seconds of maximal static contraction. Because this reflects a lower utilization of the glycolytic pathway, exercise lactate values should be lower.




Physiological factors appear to contribute to the decline in anaerobic ATP production and maximal lactate values with age (

Shephard, 1982

;
 
Smith and Serfass, 1981

). First, activity of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvic acid to lactic acid) decreases in all muscle fiber types. This decrease effectively slows glycolysis. The reduction in glycolysis may also be related to reduced amounts of glycogen stored in the skeletal muscles of the elderly.




Second, older individuals possess a smaller ratio of muscle mass to blood volume, a smaller ratio of capillary to muscle fiber, and a concomitant slower diffusion of lactic acid out of active muscle fibers and into the bloodstream (

Shephard, 1982

). Thus, it may not be that the elderly have a large deficiency in anaerobic capacity at the cellular level; rather, it may simply be that measurements from blood samples are underestimations. Of course, a combination of the first and second factors may also be operating.



Lactate Threshold(s)


Although individuals continue to exhibit at least one lactate threshold as they age, the point at which this is evident, expressed as % 

, appears to shift to a higher value in both sexes. In a study of 111 male and 57 female runners from 40 to 70 years of age, the lactate threshold increased from approximately 65 to 75% across the decades. In addition, there is some controversy about the ability of the LT to predict endurance performance in this age group (Wiswell et al., 2000
).


Mechanical Power and Capacity


The average peak power value obtained on the Margaria-Kalamen Stair Climb test (Figure 3.24A
) declines precipitously from 20 to 70 years of age (Bouchard et al., 1982
). There are no published results for the Wingate Anaerobic Test for individuals over the age of 40 and for females except in the 18- to 28-year range (Maud and Shultz, 1989
). However, Makrides et al. (1985)
 presented data on 50 male and 50 female subjects from 15 to 70 on a test similar to the WAnT (Figure 3.24B
). In this case, peak power represented an instantaneous value rather than a 5-second value. Mean power was still the average of 30 seconds of pedaling, but at a controlled rate of 60 rev·min−1
. The results in this study showed a decline of approximately 6% for each decade of age for sedentary individuals of both sexes. However, the absolute values for the females were consistently lower than those for the males. Indeed, in the Makrides study, the peak power of the females coincided with the mean power of the males. For both sexes, lean thigh volume was closely related to peak power and mean power, but this did not account for all the variation in the values or in the decline with age. A more recent study (Kostka et al., 2009
) has shown a decline in maximal anaerobic power per kg of body weight of approximately 10.3% per decade from 20 to 88 years in males.

An analysis of weight lifting (e.g., snatch, clean, and jerk) and power lifting (e.g., dead lift, squat, and bench press) records for males and females from 40 to 70 years

 showed declines in anaerobic muscle performance. The decline was greatest (and curvilinear) in the weight-lifting tasks that required explosive coordinated movements and high-balance skills. The decline in weight lifting was higher in females (~−70%) than males (~−50%). The overall decline in the power lifts was rectilinear and similar in males (~−40%) and females (~−50%). Upper and lower body muscular power demonstrated similar rates of decline with aging (

Anton et al., 2004

).




Undoubtedly, muscle mass is lost with age. Between the ages of 30 and 70, almost 25% of muscle mass is lost in both males and females (

Rogers and Evans, 1993

). Obviously, the loss of muscle mass leads to a concomitant loss in force and power production. In addition, as individuals age, the percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers, particularly fast-twitch glycolytic fibers, decreases. With this shift, there is a decline in potential glycolytic function and force production. Finally, neural activation and integration decline with age. Thus, moves requiring high levels of coordination may present a greater risk (

Anton et al., 2004

;
 
Larsson et al., 2001

).





SUMMARY





1.
 Anaerobic metabolism does not require oxygen to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but aerobic metabolism does.




2.
 Anaerobic and aerobic metabolism work together to provide ATP and thus energy for exercise. Depending on the duration and intensity of the activity, one or the other predominates.




3.
 The adenosine triphosphate-phosphocreatine (ATP- PC) system predominates in high-intensity exercise that lasts 30 seconds or less. The LA system predominates in high-intensity exercise lasting 30–75 seconds. The aerobic system predominates in exercise lasting from approximately 2 minutes to hours. This sequence is called the time-energy system continuum.




4.
 There is no generally accepted way to directly measure the anaerobic energy contribution to exercise. One indirect approach is to describe the changes in ATP, PC, and lactate levels. Another is to quantify the amount of work performed or power generated during short-duration, high-intensity activity.




5.
 Lactic acid/lactate production depends on the use of glycogen as fuel, the formation of pyruvate, and the necessity of preserving the redox potential of the cell. It results from:




a.
 Muscle contraction that in turn depends on calcium release and results in glycogenolysis




b.
 The high activity of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase compared with other glycolytic and oxidative enzymes




c.
 Recruitment of fast-twitch glycolytic (FG, type IIA and FOG, type IIX) muscle fiber

s




d. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which ultimately results in glycogenolysis




e. Insufficient oxygen, which results in anaerobiosis or the onset of anaerobic metabolism




6.
 Lactic acid/lactate clearance utilizes both an intracellular and extracellular shuttle system. MCT1 and MCT4 transporters move lactate by facilitated exchange down concentration and pH gradients.




7.
 Lactate accumulation results when production (appearance) exceeds clearance (disappearance).




8.
 The onset of all exercise is characterized by a discrepancy between oxygen demand and oxygen utilization known as the oxygen deficit. This deficit is due to the varying speeds of response of the two anaerobic and aerobic systems to the contraction of muscle and the breakdown of ATP.




9.
 During the transition from rest to exercise—the O
2
 deficit period—energy is supplied by:




a.
 Oxygen transport and utilization




b.
 The use of oxygen stores in venous blood and on myoglobin




c.
 The splitting of stored ATP-PC




d. Anaerobic glycolysis with the concomitant production of lactic acid




10.
 During recovery from exercise, oxygen consumption remains elevated, a phenomenon called excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). The following factors appear to be responsible for EPOC.




a.
 Restoration of ATP-PC stores




b.
 Restoration of oxygen stores




c.
 Elevated cardiorespiratory function




d. Elevated hormonal levels




e. Elevated body temperature




f. Lactate removal




g. Energy substrate shift from CHO to fat




11.
 During exercise, the balance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism depends on the intensity of the activity in relation to the individual’s maximal ability to produce energy using oxygen (


).




12.
 During high-intensity, short-duration (3 minutes or less) anaerobic exercise, ATP levels decrease 30–40%, PC levels decrease 60–70%, and lactate accumulation can increase well over 1,000%.




13.
 The lactate response (increase, decrease, no change after an initial rise) to long-term moderate to heavy submaximal exercise depends to a large extent on the intensity of the exercise in relation to the maximal lactate steady-state (MLSS) intensity.




14.
 During incremental work to maximum, lactate accumulates slowly until approximately 40–60%
 

 when the continual accumulation is exponentially curvilinear. The term lactate threshold (LT) is commonly used to describe the point where large increases in lactate accumulation occur.




15.
 LT1 is typically found between 40 and 60%
 

, and LT2 is found between 80 and 95%
 

. An absolute value of 4 mmol·L
−1
 is termed the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) and is often used as a training and racing guideline for adults.




16.
 The relationship between the lactate thresholds and ventilatory thresholds appears to be primarily coincidental.




17.
 The term anaerobic threshold is a misnomer and should not be used because the presence of lactate does not automatically mean that the oxygen supply is inadequate.




18.
 Performance decrements are related to high concentrations of H
+
 because of:




a.
 Pain




b.
 Reduced production of ATP through inactivation of enzymes or changes in membrane transport




c.
 Inhibition of energy substrate availability because glycogen breakdown is slowed or because fatty acid mobilization is slowed




d. Possible reduced force and velocity of muscle contraction




19.
 Lactate removal from the bloodstream after exercise follows the law of mass action: the more lactate present, the faster the rate of removal. The half-life of lactate is approximately 15–25 minutes, with full removal achieved between 30 and 60 minutes.




20.
 The time required for lactate removal can be decreased by doing an active recovery at an intensity of approximately 30–45%
 

 for cycling and 55–70%
 

 for running—at or slightly below the first lactate threshold.




21.
 During the adult years, males accumulate higher levels of blood lactate as a result of maximal work than do females, and males exhibit higher mechanical power and capacity even when they are adjusted for body weight.




22.
 Peak lactate values after incremental exercise to maximum decline after approximately 40 years of age. Females exhibit considerably lower peak values than do males.




23.
 The anaerobic capacities of children are not well-developed compared to adults. The lower amount of ATP-PC available is related to children’s small body size.




24.
 Peak lactate values after incremental exercise to maximum are lower in children than adults and vary directly with age throughout the growth years. There is no meaningful male-female difference in the ability to accumulate lactate during childhood.




25.
 Mechanical power and capacity are lower for children and adolescents than for adults, whether expressed in absolute terms or corrected for body weight.




26.
 Anaerobic metabolic processes decline from young and middle-aged adults to older adults. The decline includes lower resting levels of ATP-PC.




27.
 The mechanical power and capacity of older adults decline steadily. The decline is greater in females than in males.





Review Questions









1.
  Describe the energy continuum. For each of the following sports or events, determine the percentage contribution from the anaerobic and aerobic systems.




a.
  100-m dash




b.
  800-m run




c.
  Soccer (not goalie)




d.
  Triathlon




e.
  Volleyball spike




f.
  100-m swim




g.
  Mile run




h.
  Stealing a base




i.
  Wrestling period




2.
  List the major variables typically measured to describe the anaerobic response to exercise. Where possible, provide an example of an exercise test that can measure the variable.




3.
  Explain the five physiological reasons for the production of lactic acid. What determines whether or not lactate accumulates in the blood? How is lactate cleared?




4.
  Rank the ATP-PC, LA, and O
2
 systems from highest to lowest in terms of (a) power and (b) capacity. What is the difference between power and capacity?




5.
  Diagram the oxygen deficit and excess postexercise oxygen consumption for an activity that requires 110%
 

 in an individual whose
 

 equals 4 L·min
−1
 and whose resting oxygen is 0.25 L·min
−1
. Explain how energy is provided during the oxygen deficit time period and why oxygen remains elevated during recovery.




6.
  Diagram and explain the changes that take place in ATP, PC, and [La
−
] during constant-load, heavy exercise lasting 3 minutes or less.




7.
  Explain the concept of maximal lactate steady state and why MLSS is important in endurance performance.




8.
  Diagram the lactate response to incremental work to maximum. The ventilatory and lactate thresholds often occur at approximately the same time. Debate whether this is a result of cause and effect or coincidence. Can either the lactate thresholds or the ventilatory thresholds be accurately described as anaerobic thresholds? Why or why not?




9.
  What are the physiological effects of lactic acid production and lactate accumulation on metabolic energy production?




10.
  What is the best way to clear lactate quickly during recovery?




11.
  What are the effects of sex and age on anaerobic metabolism during exercise?
