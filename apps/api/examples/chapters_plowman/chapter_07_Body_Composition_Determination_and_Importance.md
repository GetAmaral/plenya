Introduction




Answer the following questions to yourself. Is your body weight just right, a little high, very high, a little low, or very low? Is your percent body fat (%BF) just right, a little high, very high, a little low, or very low? Do you like how you look in a bathing suit? What mental images did you have as you answered these questions?



If you are a female, chances are that regardless of the reality of your body weight, composition, and shape, you feel that your values are too high and you are dissatisfied with how you look. You are probably incorrect in your assessment, but you are certainly not alone (

Novella et al., 2015

;
 
Schneider et al., 2013

). For example, in one study (

Lutter, 1994

), active women were shown images of five individuals who were 20% underweight, 10% underweight, average weight and size, 10% overweight, and 20% overweight. The subjects were asked to select which image they would like to look like. Only 14% wanted the average shape, 44% wanted to be 10% underweight, and 38% wanted to be 20% underweight!




These feelings are, of course, largely a result of cultural expectations. There have been times in Western civilization (e.g., in the 17th century) when plumpness was the norm for feminine attractiveness. In more modern times, great changes have occurred in the cultural ideal of the female body. An analysis of
 Playboy
 centerfolds and Miss America Pageant contestants from 1960 to 1980 showed that the percentage of average weight (average weight being based on mean population values at the time) for these individuals declined steadily from approximately 90% to almost 80%. At the same time, average hip and bust sizes for these icons of beauty declined, while waist and height values increased. Thus, the ideal shape changed from the hourglass curve to a more tubular profile (

Garner et al., 1980

). The concern for the shrinking size of models’ figures is so great that at least one country (Italy) has banned from its fashion shows any model with a body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg·m
−2
 (a standard for underweight).




In another study, young and middle-aged males and females were asked to choose, from a range of different body silhouettes, three selections: one that reflected their current shape, the ideal one they would like to look like, and the one considered the most attractive to the opposite sex. A majority of both the young (59%) and the middle-aged (65%) females rated their current figures as being significantly larger than the ideal or attractive shape. However, neither the young nor the middle-aged males reported any significant differences between current, ideal, and most attractive silhouettes. Only 25% of the young and 29% of the middle-aged males expressed a desire to be smaller (

Tiggemann, 1992

). Thus, if you are a male, chances are that regardless of your real body weight, composition, and shape, you are not concerned with your body weight per se. However, you might like larger muscles and greater muscle definition, which would imply a lower percent body fat and a more triangular shape (

Novella et al., 2015

). Data on Mr. America or Mr. Universe contestants are not available to substantiate this impression, but just look at the muscle magazines at any newsstand. What body shape did you compare yourself with mentally as you considered the opening questions above? Hopefully, you visualized standards that are consistent with good health, but many males as well as females compare themselves to images present in the media that do not represent healthy weights.




Two studies of adolescents suggest that the perception of being overweight leads to unhealthy weight control behaviors. The first study (

Talamayan et al., 2006

) examined data from the 2003 Youth Risk Behavior study of a total of 9,714 normal-weight US high school students. A significant portion (25.3% of females and 6.7% of males) misperceived themselves as overweight and engaged (16.8% of all females and 6.8% of all males) in unhealthy weight control behaviors (use of diet pills, laxatives, and fasting) in the 30 days before the study. The second study (

Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2006

), a 5-year longitudinal study, showed that lower satisfaction with body weight does not serve as a motivator for engaging in healthy weight management behaviors. Rather, it predicts the use of behaviors (unhealthy dieting, disordered eating, smoking, lower levels of physical activity, and less fruit and vegetable intake) that place the adolescents at risk for further weight gain and poorer overall health.




An interesting twist regarding body image has emerged. In a study of 310 college students,
 
Neighbors and Sobal (2007)

 confirmed that women are still more dissatisfied with their bodies than men even though in this sample the prevalence of overweight was higher in males (44%) than in females (11%). Most (87%) of the “normal”-weight females wanted to weigh less, whereas considerably fewer (24%) of the “not overweight” males wanted to weigh less. Females classified as underweight expressed almost no body weight or shape dissatisfaction. The surprising result was that although both the overweight males and females wanted to lose weight, they did not select an ideal body weight that would move them into a healthier BMI category. The authors concluded that these results may suggest a shift in body size ideals to more acceptance by many individuals of larger body sizes in an era of prevalent obesity, despite the linkage of obesity to health problems.




Regardless of all of these somewhat conflicting and varied perceptions, the fact is that the prevalence of overweight and obesity is a major worldwide problem. Sixty-five percent of the world’s population lives in a country where overweight and obesity kill more people than does underweight (

World Health Organization, 2011

). The 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study revealed that the number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide was 2.1 billion, of whom 671 million were obese. At all ages, prevalence was higher

 in developed countries than in developing countries. The overall percentages were for males 23.8% (youth) and 36.9% (adults) and for females 22.6% (youth) and 38.0% (adults). No country has shown significant decreases in obesity in the past three decades; however, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down (

Ng et al., 2014

). The prevalence of obesity is lower in Canada in both adults and children/adolescents over the age of 6 years than in the United States (

Carroll et al., 2015

;
 
Ng et al., 2014

;
 
Shields et al., 2011

).
 
Figure 7.1A

 shows the trend in obesity among children in the United States from the early 1970s to 2011–2012. In the early 1970s, the prevalence of obesity was 5% for children 2–5 years, 4% for children 6–11 years, and 6% for adolescents 12–19 years. Data for 1963–1970 are not included because they are not available across the age span, but what data are available showed values less than 5% for youth 6–17 years (

Fryar et al., 2014a

). In 2011–2012, based on measured NHANES data, 16.9% of US children and adolescents 2–19 years were obese. In addition (not shown), 8.1% of infants and toddlers were obese. The rates for boys were 5% less than 2 years, 9.5% at 2–5 years, 16.4% at 6–11 years, and 20.3% at 12–19 years. The comparable values for girls were 11.4% (<2 years), 7.2% (2–5 years), 19.1% (6–11 years), and 20.7% (12–19 years) (

Ogden et al., 2014

). These are meaningful increases; however, the increase appears to be plateauing.

Figure 7.1B

 presents the trend in overweight, obesity, and extreme obesity among adults 20–74 years from 1960–1962 through 2011–2012 (

Fryar et al., 2014b

). While the values for overweight for both males and females exhibit little variation over this time span, both obesity and extreme obesity percentages have slowly and then sharply increased. In the late 1970s, 15% of adults were obese. In the early 1990s, zero states had an adult obesity rate of more than 25% (Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010). In 2011–2012, based on measured National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, 34.9% of US adults were obese. For adult males, the values were 29.0% at 20–39 years, 39.4% at 40–59 years, and 32.0% ≥60 years. The comparable values for adult females were 31.8% (20–39 years), 39.5% (40–59 years), and 38.1% (≥60 years) (

Ogden et al., 2014

). In 2014, by self-reported data for adults as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), no states had an obesity prevalence less than 20%; only 5 states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20 and 25%; 23 states (Guam and Puerto Rico) had a prevalence of obesity between 25% and less than 30%; 19 states had an obesity prevalence of between 30 and 35%; and 3 states (Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia) had a prevalence of obesity ≥35%. The Midwest (30.7%) and South (30.6%) had the highest prevalence followed by the Northeast (27.3%) and then the West (25.7%) (

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014

;
 
Ogden et al., 2014

).




When the results of the NHANES study are broken down by race/ethnicity (

Ogden et al., 2014

), the data indicate that there is a disparity. For males and females combined, the prevalence of obesity is lowest in non-Hispanic Asian youth 2–19 years (8.6%) followed by non-Hispanic white (14.1%), non-Hispanic black (20.2%), and Hispanics (22.4%). For adults ≥20 years, the order of obesity prevalence varies slightly: non-Hispanic Asian (10.9%), non-Hispanic white (33.4%), Hispanic (42.0%), and non-Hispanic black (47.8%).




The good news is that overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in either youth or adults from 2003–2004 to 2011–2012 (Ogden et al., 2014). The bad news is that the prevalence of high overweight and obesity values has not declined. There is an insidious problem with overweight and an
 obesity epidemic
.




As an exercise specialist/physical educator/rehabilitation therapist/athletic trainer, you will be dealing with a public that has more questions and concerns about body composition and weight control than just about anything else we deal with. This and the next chapter are designed to present you with an understanding of these crucial areas.





Body Composition Assessment




Laboratory Techniques


The two major approaches to body composition assessment are chemical and anatomical. The chemical (molecular) approach yields the amounts of water, fat, protein, and mineral in the body. The anatomical (tissue/system) approach partitions the body into components that can be separated by dissection, that is, skin, muscle, adipose tissue, bone, and organs (Ackland et al., 2012
; Clarys et al., 1984
). Both of these approaches may be direct or indirect. Table 7.1
 provides a listing of laboratory and field techniques for body composition assessment. Note that two of the laboratory techniques have an “R” beside the name indicating that these are “Reference” techniques. Those are cadaver analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By definition, these two methods and a compilation of several methods (typically densitometry, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and hydrometry combined into a multicomponent model) are considered the most accurate techniques for measuring body composition and are the references against which other techniques should be compared. The two-component model partitions the body into fat mass and fat-free mass; the three-component model partitions the body into fat mass, total body water, and fat-free dry solid; and the four-component model partitions the body into fat mass, total body water, bone mineral, and residual (Figure 7.2). The three-component model greatly increases validity over the two-component model, and the four-component model marginally improves on the three-component model (Withers et al., 1999
). This does not mean, however, that the multicomponent models are the most applicable or practical, nor are they considered true criterion “gold standard” measures. Many of these techniques are expensive, cumbersome, and/or time-consuming, requiring sensitive instrumentation operated by highly trained technicians. None of the approaches to estimating body fat have been validated against cadaver dissection (Clarys et al., 1999
).

The DXA technique is pictured and described in Chapter 016
 because it is considered the “gold standard,” or criterion measure, for the assessment of bone mineral density. Figure 7.3
 panel A
 shows air displacement plethysmography in a BOD POD; panel B
 pictures underwater weighing. Although only a two-component analysis, densitometry remains a useful technique in laboratory settings. Hydrostatic (underwater weighing) will be described in detail here (Behnke and Wilmore, 1974
; Going, 2005
; Goldman and Buskirk, 1961
; Lohman and Chen, 2005
; Ratamess, 2010
)
.


Hydrostatic (Underwater) Weighing: Densitometry



Hydrostatic
, or underwater, weighing
 determines body composition through the calculation of body density (Behnke and Wilmore, 1974
; Going, 2005
; Goldman and Buskirk, 1961
; Ratamess, 2010
). We have Archimedes, a Greek mathematician who lived in the 2nd century bc
, to thank for this technique. When King Hieron of Syracuse commissioned a new crown, he suspected that the jeweler substituted silver for pure gold inside the crown. The king asked Archimedes to determine the composition of the crown without harming it in any way. Legend has it that as Archimedes was pondering this question at the public baths, he solved the problem and went running through the streets naked, shouting, “Eureka!” (“I have found it!”).





Hydrostatic Weighing
 Criterion measure for determining body composition through the calculation of body density.



Archimedes’ Principle
 The principle that a partially or fully submerged object will experience an upward buoyant force equal to the weight on the volume of fluid displaced by the object.



Densitometry
 The measurement of mass per unit volume.



Fat-Free Weight
 The weight of body tissue excluding extractable fat.



Body Composition
 The partitioning of body mass into FFM (weight or percentage) and fat mass (weight or percentage).





What Archimedes observed was that an amount of water was displaced from the bath equal to the volume of the body entering the bath. Archimedes reasoned that the volume was proportional to the mass of the object and that the object’s loss of weight in water equaled the weight of the volume of water displaced. We now define the mass of an object divided by its loss of weight in water as the
 specific gravity
 of that object. Archimedes also reasoned that the body (or any other object floating or submerged) is buoyed up by a counterforce equal to the weight of the water displaced. Thus,
 Archimedes’ principle
 states that a partially or fully submerged object experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight or the volume of fluid displaced by the object. Based on this principle, the volume of any object, including the human body, can be measured by determining the weight lost by complete submersion underwater. In the case of the human body, dividing the mass of the body by its volume defines
 body density
. When Archimedes compared the amount of water displaced by a mass of pure gold and a mass of pure silver equal to the mass of the king’s crown, he found that the crown displaced more water than did the gold, but less than did the silver. He confirmed this result by weighing, in air and underwater, masses of gold and silver equal to the weight of the crown in air and found the crown to have an intermediate specific gravity value. Thus, the crown was not pure gold (only about 75%), and we can only speculate as to the fate of the jeweler (

Behnke and Wilmore, 1974

).




Even if you have never been weighed underwater, you probably have a basic understanding of the principle just described. Think back to a swimming class. Could you float easily, or were you a sinker who could walk on the bottom of the pool? How would you describe floaters and sinkers in terms of being lean or fat? Whether one floats or sinks depends on one’s body density, and body density (mass per unit volume) is largely determined by the amount of body fat present. The density of bone and muscle tissue is greater than the density of fat tissue. Thus, the leaner, more muscular individual weighs more underwater and tends to sink, whereas an individual with a large amount of fat weighs less and tends to float.




Whole-body
 densitometry
, which is the measurement of mass per unit volume, is the foundation of hydrostatic weighing. It is based on dividing the total body weight (

Figure 7.2

, row A) into two compartments: fat and fat-free weight (FFW) (row B). Row C lists the component parts of the
 fat-free weight
 (all of the tissues of the body minus the extractable fat) as muscle, bone, skin, blood, and organs; this represents a second model. The fat compartment includes both storage and essential fats.
 Storage fat
 is the fat in the subcutaneous adipose tissues and the fat surrounding the various internal organs (visceral fat).
 Essential fat
 includes the fat in the bone marrow, central nervous system, cell membranes, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and muscles.

Note that although the terms
 lean body mass
 (LBM) and FFW (sometimes called the fat-free body, FFB, or fat-free mass, FFM) are used interchangeably, they are slightly different. Technically, LBM includes the essential fat, but FFW does not. Chemically, FFW is composed of water, proteins, and bone mineral (

Figure 7.2

, row D); this is a third model of compartmentalization or composition (

Lohman, 1986

). Although each of these models (B, C, and D) describes the composition of the body, when the term body composition is used in exercise physiology, it generally refers to model B. That is,
 body composition
 is defined as the partitioning of body mass into FFM (weight or percentage) and fat mass (weight or percentage).




Compartmentalizing the body into only fat and FFW (not water, mineral, protein, and fat) and using this two-compartment model to determine percent body fat depends on the following assumptions:




1.
 The densities of the fat and the FFW are known and additive.




2.
 The densities of water, bone mineral, and protein that make up the FFW are known and are relatively constant from individual to individual.




3.
 The percentage of each fat-free component is relatively stable from individual to individual.




4.
 The individual being evaluated differs from the assumptions of the equation being used only in the amount of storage fat.




Hydrostatic weighing determines

 body density (D
B
), defined as mass (M) or weight (WT) divided by volume (V), according to the following formula where the numerator represents mass and the denominator represents volume (

Behnke and Wilmore, 1974

):



7.1 




The mass of an individual in air (M
A
) can be measured either by weighing that individual nude on a sensitive, calibrated scale or by weighing the subject in a bathing suit and then subtracting the weight of the suit. The volume of the human body is obtained by applying Archimedes’ principle. In practice, the individual being weighed is submerged in water, attached in some way to a scale or strain gauge instrumentation (

Figure 7.3B

). The subject then exhales as much air as possible and sits quietly for 3–7 seconds, while the weight is recorded. Multiple trials are usually necessary. The highest consistent weight is selected from the trials, and the weight of the apparatus, called the tare weight, is then subtracted from the scale weight. The resultant weight is the underwater weight (M
W
). Body weight may be measured in lb or kg, but calculations are typically done in metric units, so conversion may be necessary. Not all air can be expelled from the body, and air makes the body more buoyant (lighter in weight). Therefore, the underwater weight must be corrected for residual volume (the volume of air remaining in the lungs following maximal expiration) and for gastrointestinal gases, the assumed constant equal to 100 mL or 0.1 L in Equation
 
7.1

. The underwater weight must also be corrected for the density of the water, D
W
, which in turn is temperature dependent.







Example






For example, the following measurements were obtained from a football player:




MA
 = 225 lb (102.3 kg)   Water temperature = 34°C


MW
 = 6.07 kg   Water density at 34°C = 0.9944


RV = 1.583 L





Substituting into Equation
 
7.1

 we get












Remember that the numerator in this equation represents mass and the denominator represents volume. In the metric system, 1 L of water (a volume measure) weighs 1 kg (a mass measure), so conversely, 1 kg of water mass occupies 1 L of volume (Appendix A). Therefore, the equation can be solved as written.












Although kg·L
−1
 is an accurate unit, the D
B
 is usually reported in g·cc
−1
 units. Dividing the kg·L
−1
 unit by 1,000 yields g·mL
−1
. Then, because 1 mL equals 1 cc (cubic centimeter), the cc designation can easily be substituted for the mL and typically is. Thus, 1.0758 kg·L
−1
 = 1.0758 g·cc
−1
.








Once body density has been measured, %BF can be calculated. The two most widely used formulas for converting body density to %BF were developed by Siri and Brozek. They have been derived differently but, within the density units of 1.09 and 1.03 g·cc
−1
, agree within 1% on the %BF values calculated. At lower densities, the Siri formula gives increasingly higher %BF values than the Brozek formula (

Lohman, 1981

).



7.2 



7.3 




Brozek’s formula assumes that the individual has neither lost nor gained substantial amounts of body weight recently.







Example






Using the body density results from the football player in the preceding example in Equations 7.2
 and 7.3
:















As expected, the %BF values are within 1% of each other with an actual difference of only 0.5% (10.6% − 10.1% = 0.5%)

.







Once %BF has been determined, body weight at any selected fat percentage can be calculated using the following sequence of formulas. The first formula simply determines the amount of fat-free weight an individual currently has (WT1
).


7.4 




The second formula calculates the desired weight (WT
2
).



7.5 




The third formula calculates the amount of weight to be gained or lost.



7.6 







Example






For example, an individual who currently weighs 150 lb at a body fat of 25% wishes to reduce her body fat to 17%. Equation 7.4
 is used to calculate her current fat-free weight.











Her current fat-free weight and selected %BF are then substituted into Equation
 
7.5

 to obtain her weight goal.












Comparing her current weight to her goal weight in Equation
 
7.6

, we get












This means that to be 17% BF, this individual must reduce her current weight by 14.5 lb. Of course, these calculations assume that in the process of losing weight, muscle mass is maintained. This assumption is not always true.

A
 and M
W
. As you do each calculation, mentally review the reasons for each step to ensure that you understand the underlying principles.




When the measuring technique is properly conducted, the error of %BF determined by densitometry is approximately ±2.7% for adults. This error range is primarily due to variations in the composition of the FFM (

Lohman, 1981

). The error is always lowest when the individual being tested closely matches the sample on which the equation was developed (

Heyward and Stolarczyk, 1996

).

Densitometry: Children and Adolescents and the Older Adult


The previous section outlined the basic assumptions underlying hydrostatic weighing (densitometry). Research has challenged these assumptions with regard to children and adolescents (Lohman et al., 1984
)
.



The values for the FFW or the FFB components for adults (males and females) are assumed to be approximately 73% for water and 7% for mineral content, with an overall density of FFW of 1.100 g·cc
−1
 (

Figure 7.4

, dashed lines) (

Boileau et al., 1984

;
 
Lohman, 1986

). Protein, not shown on the graph, makes up about 20% of the FFW of adults.










FIGURE 7.4
 Estimated Changes in Fat-free Body (FFB) Composition as a Function of Age.
 A.
 The density of the fat-free body, also known as the FFW, is much lower in both male and female children than in adults. FFB density increases as the child matures, but the female density is lower at each age than the male density and never reaches the assumed adult values of 1.1. B.
 The percentage of FFB that is composed of water is higher in both male and female children than in adults. As the child matures, the percentage of water in the FFB declines, but the female percentage is always higher than the male even after adulthood is reached. C.
 The percentage of FFB that is composed of minerals is lower in both male and female children than in adults. As the child matures, the percentage of minerals in the FFB increases, but the female percentage is always lower than the male percentage even after adulthood is reached. Source

 Lohman (1986). Reprinted by permission of Williams & Wilkins.






Boileau et al. (1984)

 have shown that the percentage of water in FFW decreases (

Figure 7.4B

) from 77–78% at ages 7–9 years to 73% at approximately age 20 in a steady but slightly curvilinear fashion. Across the age span, females have a slightly higher percentage of water in FFW than do males. Conversely, the percentage of mineral content in FFW (

Figure 7.4C

) increases from approximately 5% at ages 7–9 to 7% at age 20. This change is also slightly curvilinear, and the values for females are consistently lower than those for males. The protein change is minimal (and therefore not presented in
 
Figure 7.4

), varying only about 1% (from 19% to 20%) over the age span. The result of these changes is that body density also increases in a curvilinear fashion from approximately 1.08 to 1.10 g·cc
−1
 for adult males and from 1.08 to 1.095 g·cc
−1
 for adult females. This means adult females never meet the 1.10-g·cc
−1
 assumed value (

Figure 7.4A

) (

).




Because the components are constantly changing as children mature, no single formula can be used for children of different ages. Nor can one formula be used for boys and for girls.
 
Table 7.2

 shows the array of age and sex formulas needed.

 age- and sex-specific formula yields







Most research published to date for children and adolescents has been on normally active nonathletes. Further work is in progress to determine the effects of physical activity and/or athletic participation on bone mineral, hydration, and body density values throughout the growth years. %BF values of young athletes, even if the appropriate age and sex formulas are used, must be interpreted cautiously. Although the pediatric formulas are better than adult formulas, even the pediatric formulas may need to be revised for young athletes. In addition, research in the area of body composition, on both sedentary and active youths, should directly measure water (W) by hydrometry and bone mineral content (M) by DXA or pQCT of the FFW as well as body density to more accurately account for all body compartments. These variables should be used in a more complex formula such as








At the other end of the age continuum, the older adult, the effect of bone mineral density loss (termed osteopenia) should be considered in the determination of %BF. Theoretically, a loss of bone mineral density would cause a decrease in body density and, thus, an overestimation of %BF if not accounted for (

Ballor et al., 1988

;
 
Brodie, 1988a

;
 
Lohman, 1986

). Indeed, the multicomponent model is preferable for all ages when equipment, time, and resources allow it.



Field Tests of Body Composition


Field methods to determine body composition can be classified as anthropometry (measurement of the human body) or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Anthropometric techniques include skinfolds, height and weight, BMI, diameters, and circumferences. These techniques are generally practical, require a minimum of equipment, and (if properly applied) can provide useful, reasonably accurate information. They vary in the degree of skill needed by the tester.


Skinfolds


A widely used anthropometric estimation of body size or composition involves the measurement of skinfolds at selected sites. Skinfolds
 (sometimes called fatfolds) are the double thickness of the skin plus the adipose tissue between the parallel layers of the skin (Figure 7.5
). Because skin thickness varies only slightly among individuals, skinfold measures generally indicate the thickness of the subcutaneous fat (Behnke and Wilmore, 1974
). Technically, however, adipose tissue (and thus the subcutaneous fatfold) has both a fat component and a fat-free component. The fat-free component is composed of water, blood vessels, and nerves. As the fat content of the adipose tissue increases (as in obesity), the water content decreases (Roche, 1987
).

Skinfolds

The use of skinfold thickness to estimate body composition is based on two assumptions. The first is that selected skinfold sites are representative of the total subcutaneous adipose tissue mass. In general, evidence supports this assumption (

Lohman, 1981

;
 
Roche, 1987

). The second assumption is that the subcutaneous tissue mass has a known relationship with total body fat.
 
Table 7.3

 shows the distribution of total body fat and the relative percentages of each storage site for a reference male and a reference female 20–24 years old.

 Percentage of Fat Distribution in a Reference Male and a Reference Female

Most of the values in
 
Table 7.3

 are estimates. They indicate that approximately one third of the total fat for both males (3.1 kg subcutaneous fat/10.3–10.5 kg total fat) and females (5.1 kg subcutaneous fat/13.4–17.2 kg total fat) is estimated to be subcutaneous. Other estimates put this value as high as 70% and as low as 20%. With advancing age, a proportionally smaller amount of fat is stored subcutaneously. Thus, any given skinfold would then represent a smaller percentage of total body fat. It may also be that lean individuals and fat individuals store their fat in proportionally different ways. Additionally, females may store more or less fat subcutaneously than males (

Lohman, 1981

). There is little disagreement regarding the differences between essential fat amounts for males and females. The higher essential fat values in females are generally explained as additional storage needed to meet the energy requirements of pregnancy and lactation.




These variations in the estimation of subcutaneous fat percentage mean that the second assumption about the use of skinfolds to estimate body composition is not as firmly

 based as the first (

Brodie, 1988a

). One way of dealing with this problem is to use equations that are age-adjusted or generalized for sedentary individuals and population specific for various athletic groups (

Going, 2006

).




When skinfolds are taken by trained professionals and the appropriate equations are used, the variability between appropriate equations and accuracy of skinfold prediction of %BF compared with underwater weighing is approximately ±3–5% (

Jackson and Pollock, 1978

;
 
Kaminsky and Dwyer, 2006

;
 
Lohman, 1992

). Improper techniques can result in large prediction errors. The greatest source of error is improper location of the skinfold site. Anyone wishing to use this method to predict %BF should locate the site precisely and practice the technique repeatedly before using it.
 
Table 7.4

 presents equations that can be used to predict %BF from two or three skinfold sites. These equations are specific for sex and age. Also included is an equation developed using a multicomponent reference model for athletes (

Evans et al., 2005

).

.





Skinfold thickness values may be used in ways other than to predict %BF. First, the millimeter values of several sites (usually 5–7 from anatomically diverse locations) can be added to form a
 sum of skinfolds
. Such a sum indicates the relative degree of fatness among individuals. It can also be used to detect changes within a given individual, if measurements are taken repeatedly over time. Second, skinfolds may be used to determine the pattern of distribution of subcutaneous fat. Such a pattern has emerged as an important predictor of the health hazards of obesity (

Harrison et al., 1988

;
 
Roche, 1987

;
 
Van Itallie, 1988

). Fat distribution patterns and the associated health problems are discussed later in this chapter.



Height and Weight


In some situations, such as when large numbers of individuals are being evaluated, the only measures of body size that can easily be obtained are height and weight. These values are often used along with height and weight charts that include standards such as acceptable body weight (<10% over the chart weight for a given height), overweight (10–20% over the chart weight), and obese (>20% over the chart weight) sometimes by frame size. Such use of height and weight charts is minimally acceptable for large group data but is not recommended as a source of what an individual “should” weigh, for the following reasons (Burton et al., 1985
; Himes and Frisancho, 1988
; Nieman, 1990
; Powers and Howley, 1990
):



1.
 The most commonly available height and weight charts from Metropolitan Life Insurance (1959 and 1983) were compiled from the lowest mortality data

 on individuals who purchased life insurance in nongroup situations. The age range was 25–59 years. Some people were included more than once when they purchased more than one policy. Thus, the sample was not randomly drawn, was not statistically valid, and was not truly a representative of the total American population, especially older adults, lower socioeconomic groups, and specific ethnic groups.




2.
 Individuals with known heart disease, cancer, and/or diabetes were excluded, but smokers were included. Thus, risk factors other than body weight were ignored in determining mortality ratios.




3.
 Only body weights at the time of purchasing the insurance, not at the time of death, were considered. This omission could greatly affect the categories of acceptable, overweight, and obese weights. In addition, in many cases, height and weight were self-reported and not measured. The accuracy of self-reported data must be questioned.




4.
 The determination of frame size is not always defined. Even when it is, frame size is very difficult to defend and interpret in relation to body weight.




5.
 The 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance height-weight chart shows higher weight values at a given height and frame size than does the comparable 1959 chart, reflecting the trend of a national weight gain. The 1959 table values were listed as desirable weights (i.e., weights associated with the lowest mortality), but the 1983 table values were not so listed. If the Metropolitan tables are the only thing available for judging acceptable or unacceptable weights, the 1959 (not the 1983) version should be selected, except for older adults. Some evidence suggests that desirable weights are slightly higher in older adults. Therefore, the 1983 table values can be used for this population.




6.
 Weight per se does not provide any information on body composition. What matters is the %BF, not the body weight, because %BF is related to health.




Fortunately, even if height and weight are the only variables known and the use of height and weight charts is not recommended, a reasonable alternative is available: the body mass index.



Body Mass Index



Body mass index (BMI)
 is a ratio of the total body weight to height and indicates ponderosity. Several ratios have been proposed, but the one used most frequently is weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared [WT ÷ HT2
 (kg·m−2
)]. This ratio is also known as the Quetelet Index (Brodie, 1988a
; Revicki and Israel, 1986
; Satwanti et al., 1980
). Calculated BMI can then be compared against standard values to determine whether the individual has acceptable body weight, is overweight, or is obese (Table 7.5
).

) Standards for Acceptable Body Weight, Overweight, and Obesity in Nonathletes

Body Mass Index (BMI)
 is a ratio of the total body weight to height.








Example






If a female subject (age = 30 years) weighs 165 lb and is 5 ft 8 in. tall, calculation of her BMI first requires conversion to metric units. Dividing 165 lb by 2.2 lb·kg−1
 gives a weight of 75 kg. Multiplying 68 in. by 2.54 cm in.−1
 gives 172.7 cm (1.73 m). Height value squared is 2.98 m2
. Thus, BMI = 75 kg ÷ 2.98 m2
 = 25.2 kg·m−2
. Check Table 7.4
 to see whether this is an acceptable, overweight, or obesity value for this individual.







The selection of BMI values at the upper limit of acceptable is based on the data relating BMI to morbidity (disease occurrence, particularly cardiovascular disease [CVD]), and mortality (death). For adults, there is a J-shaped curvilinear increase in excess mortality (a greater number of deaths than expected in a given population) with an increasing BMI as initially determined

 in the now classic study by
 
Bray (1985)

. He found that BMI values from 15 to 25 kg·m
−2
 represented no excess mortality risk. Significant increases in risk were shown to begin at a BMI of 27.3 kg·m
−2
 for females and 27.8 kg·m
−2
 for males. Therefore, in 1985, the National Institute of Health defined obesity as a BMI of 27.3 kg·m
−2
 for females and 27.8 kg·m
−2
 for males.




In 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted BMI standards of less than 18.5 for underweight, 18.5–24.9 for normal weight, 25–29.9 for overweight, and ≥30 for obesity. Obesity was further divided into three classes. Class I obesity is indicated by a BMI of 30–34.9, class II by a BMI of 35–39.9, and class III by a BMI ≥ 40. All values are in kg·m
−2
. In 1998, the National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States concurred with these standards.




Using these WHO cut points,
 
Meyer et al. (2002)

 also found a J-shaped curvilinear association between BMI and total mortality (

Figure 7.6

) even when stratified based on smoking habits and physical activity, although their data were limited to males. So few deaths occurred in those with a BMI of less than 18.5 kg·m
−2
 over the length of the study that its influence on the curve has been omitted in
 
Figure 7.6

.

BMI has been shown to correlate highly with %BF derived from skinfold measures (r = 0.74) and hydrostatic weighing (r = 0.58–0.85). However, when compared with cadaver adipose tissue weight, the relationship to BMI is lower, that is, r = 0.55 (r = 0. 63 for M and 0. 53 for F) between the two variables accounting for only approximately 30% of the variance (

Figure 7.7

) (

Clarys et al., 1999

). Thus, these correlations indicate a moderate relationship, but they also suggest that there is considerable measurement error in using BMI as an estimate of body adiposity (>5%). In situations where the same group of individuals was evaluated, skinfolds generally predicted %BF better than BMI did. Individuals with a normal BMI can actually have high body fat levels, and individuals with a high BMI (especially those in the 25–27 kg·m
−2
 range) may actually have normal, acceptable body fat levels. Individuals who are obviously active and/or muscular should have %BF more directly measured (

Gallagher et al., 1996

). The Focus on Research box reports a study showing the difficulty with using BMI to classify collegiate athletes and nonathletes as overweight. At any given BMI, females have a higher %BF than do males. Older individuals have a higher %BF at any given BMI than do younger individuals, and the association with clinical outcomes and mortality is weaker (

Chang et al., 2012

;
 
Gallagher et al., 1996

;
 
Sardinha and Teixeira, 2005

). The degree of adiposity associated with a given level of BMI varies by racial group/ethnicity as well. At the same BMI, black males and females tend to have higher lean body mass and lower fat mass than do white males and females. Conversely, Asian populations may have higher body fat percentages at a given BMI (although this is still under debate) (

Flegal et al., 2010

), and health risks may begin at a lower BMI among Asians (

Ogden et al., 2014

).

 Finally, BMI gives no indication of fat distribution. The importance of fat distribution is discussed later in this chapter. Nevertheless, BMI is often (and acceptably) used as indication of overweight or obesity and risk stratification in the absence of more specific methods to estimate total body fat, particularly when mass screening is done (

Sardinha and Teixeira, 2005

).

FOCUS ON RESEARCH






BMI as a Predictor of Percent Fat in College Athletes and Nonathletes






The purposes of this study were to describe the relationship between %BF and BMI in college athletes and nonathletes and to determine the accuracy of the standard of ≥25 kg·m−2
 BMI as defining excessive body fatness in these populations. Data from varsity athletes (149 M and 77 F) and 213 undergraduate students majoring in kinesiology and enrolled in an exercise physiology lab class at a major Midwest university were used in the analyses. The male athletes were involved in basketball, wrestling, ice hockey, and football. The female athletes competed in basketball, crew, and softball.







Overweight was defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg·m
−2
 but less than 30 kg·m
−2
; obesity was defined as ≥30 kg·m
−2
. Overfat was defined as ≥20% BF for males and ≥33% BF for females. No football lineman had a BMI less than 25 kg·m
−2
, and only one had a %BF less than 20%. Therefore, the linemen were separated out from the rest of the male athletes. The results are presented in the figure accompanying: A for males and B for females. FP means false positive—individuals who were classified as overweight but had normal %BF; FN means false negative—individuals who were classified as normal weight but were overfat; TP means true positive—individuals who were classified as overweight and who were overfat; TN means true negative—individuals who were both normal weight and normal %BF. The concern is for those individuals who are incorrectly classified, that is, the FPs and the FNs.
















The scatterplot in Figure A shows that 67% of the male athletes and 25% of the male nonathletes fell within the FP quadrant. The scatterplot in Figure B shows that 31% of the female athletes and 7% of the female nonathletes fell within the FP quadrant. There were no FN in either the male or the female athletes, but 44% of the female nonathletes and 6% of male nonathletes fell within the FN quadrant. These results indicate that BMI misclassifies normal fat individuals a large percentage of the time. Conversely, a large percentage of overfat female nonathletes were classified as normal weight by BMI.








Statistically determined optimal BMI cut points to minimize the false classifications and maximize the specificity (identification of normal-weight individuals as such) and sensitivity (identification of overfat individuals as overweight by BMI) were determined to be 27.9 kg·m
−2
 for male athletes, 34.1 kg·m
−2
 for football linemen, 26.5 kg·m
−2
 for male nonathletes, 27.7 kg·m
−2
 for female athletes, and 24.0 kg·m
−2
 for female nonathletes. Interestingly, these optimal cut points are consistent with the 1985 NIH recommendations of ≥27.3 kg·m
−2
 for females and ≥27.8 kg·m
−2
 for males to define overweight (the 85th percentile of BMI distribution in young adults 20–29 years). Optimal cut points for the nonathletes are lower than those for the athletes at least in part because of less muscle mass in the nonathletes. These results illustrate the limitations in the BMI classification when using one standard for all adults.

).

Waist-to-Hip Ratio/Waist Circumference


Waist-to-hip (W/H) ratio is another way to estimate health risk based on the individual’s pattern of fat distribution. Research has shown that the W/H ratio is a stronger predictor for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and overall death risk than body weight, BMI, or %BF in adults (Brownell et al., 1987
; Folsom et al., 1993
). In the
 absence of large total fat stores, the W/H can aid in the identification of certain hormonal and metabolic abnormalities associated with a relative increase in abdominal size but not total fat mass. However, for any given W/H ratio, there can be considerable variability in total body fat. Additionally, increases in body fat including intra-abdominal fat may not be detected if a corresponding increase occurs in hip circumference (Sardinha and Teixeira, 2005
).



Waist circumference is measured with a tape measure, to the nearest centimeter, at the level of the natural indentation or at the navel if no indentation is apparent. Hip circumference is measured at the largest site. Both measures should be taken while the individual is standing

 and without clothes. The average value for females aged 17–39 years is 0.80, and this value increases with age to above 0.90. Comparable averages for males range from 0.90 to 0.98. Values ≥0.84 for females and 0.99 for males 20–60 years and ≥0.90 and 1.03 for females and males, respectively, 60–69 years indicate a high risk for metabolic disease (

Ratamess, 2010

;
 
Stamford, 1991

).




In 1998, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s expert panel on obesity concluded that waist circumference (also known as waist girth) alone was more strongly related to visceral abdominal adipose tissue and more predictive of disease risk than the W/H ratio in adults. Similarly, W/H ratio is not a good index of intra-abdominal fat deposition in children and adolescents (

Sardinha and Teixeira, 2005

;
 
Semiz et al., 2007

).




A high waist circumference is associated with an increased risk for Type 2 diabetes, a poor blood lipid profile, high blood pressure, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and CVD. It is a stronger predictor of diabetes than is BMI; it can identify those who are at greater cardiometabolic risk better than can BMI; it is consistently related to the risk of developing coronary heart disease; and it is strongly associated with all-cause mortality and selected cause-specific mortality rates (

Aune et al., 2015

;
 
Carmienke et al., 2013

;
 
Klein et al., 2007

;
 
van Dijk et al., 2012

;
 
White et al., 2015

). American College of Sports Medicine now endorses high risk as a waist measure greater than 99 cm (>39 in.) for males and greater than 89 cm (>35 in.) for females (

American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM], 2010

), but the traditional values of greater than 102 cm (40 in.) for males and 88 cm (35 in.) for females are still sometimes used as cutoff points (

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 1998

;
 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000

).



Bioelectrical Impedance (Impedance Plethysmography)


Determining body composition by Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA) has gained a great deal of acceptance in fitness facilities and schools primarily because the procedure can easily be done. In many BIA analyzers, four electrodes are attached to a quietly resting supine subject’s hands and feet (two per limb either ipsilaterally or contralaterally) (Figure 7.9A
). Some BIA equipment simply requires the individual to either stand on an electronic digital platform scale with built-in footpad electrodes or to hold the analyzer in both hands (Figure 7.9B). In all types of BIA equipment, a harmless, sensationless, low-amperage (80 mA), radio frequency (50 kHz) electrical current is passed between the electrodes, and the resistance (in ohms) to the current is recorded. Body volume is assumed to be a cylinder of constant cross-sectional area with uniform density distribution. Body volume is more often defined as height squared divided by resistance (HT2
 ÷ R) (Baumgartner et al., 1990
; Brodie, 1988b
; Van Loan, 1990
).













FIGURE 7.9
 A, B:
 Determination of body composition by bioelectrical impedance.





The ability to conduct the electrical current is directly related to the amount of water and electrolytes in the various body tissues. Electrical current flows more easily in fat-free tissue (which offers less resistance) than in fat tissue (which acts as an
 impedance
) because the fat-free tissue has a higher percentage of water and electrolytes. Therefore, individuals with more fat-free weight (FFW) have lower resistance values, and those with more fat weight have higher resistance values.




Because the BIA technique actually measures total body water (TBW), estimates can be made of body density and FFW on the basis of the obtained TBW and the assumed known percentages of water in the body and in the FFW. Another technique is to derive regression equations from height, resistance, and/or other anthropometric variables (such as weight, age, sex, skinfolds, or circumferences) to directly predict FFW or %BF. Hydrostatic weighing is usually used as the criterion measure. As with skinfolds, a number of equations have been generated in this manner.




As you might suspect, the accuracy of BIA measurement depends highly on a normal level of hydration. Either too much fluid (hyperhydration) or too little fluid (hypohydration or dehydration) will affect the readings. The exact effect is controversial. Theoretically, an increase in body water should decrease resistance and %BF. Some experimental evidence supports this theory, but other studies have

 shown the opposite result. That is, dehydration caused by exercise has decreased resistance, and hyperhydration from ingestion of replacement supplements has increased resistance. This variance may be related to whether the electrolyte content changes proportionally to water and to the shift in water between compartments. What is clear is that individuals should be measured 3–4 hours after the ingestion of a meal or after an exercise session and should not be under the influence of substances such as caffeine that might act as a diuretic (

Baumgartner et al., 1990

;
 
Deurenberg et al., 1988

;
 
Stump et al., 1988

;
 
Van Loan, 1990

).




The accuracy of BIA also depends on both ambient and skin temperatures. Resistance is higher in cool temperatures than warm ones. Thus, if an individual is tested repeatedly over a period of 15–20 minutes in an environment where body cooling occurs, the %BF estimate will go up as the skin temperature goes down. Care must therefore be taken that testing is done at a neutral temperature (27–29°C; 80–84°F) when the subject is neither overheated nor chilled (

Caton et al., 1988

;
 
Stump et al., 1988

).




The accuracy of BIA estimates of body composition is also influenced by the equation used. These equations include those for body geometry, cross-sectional area, and current distribution, as well as those used to convert resistance to TBW, body density, and %BF, and are generally closely guarded secrets by the manufacturers. Each of the electrical assumptions is violated by the human body, but the discrepancies are apparently not enough to rule out their use in BIA. However, these violations do limit the accuracy for estimating TBW, FFW, and %BF. If the criterion measure upon which the equation was based did not take into account the age-related differences in TBW, these inaccuracies would be confounded (

Baumgartner et al., 1990

;
 
Brodie, 1988a

;
 
Chumlea and Sun, 2005

;
 
Hodgdon and Fitzgerald, 1987

). One recent study found that when compared to DXA, FM was underestimated and FFM overestimated by BIA, more so in males than females, and in normal weight than in overweight and obese individuals (

Berstad et al., 2012

).




BIA values under standard conditions will be consistent, but the accuracy is probably no better than that achieved by skinfolds (

Baumgartner et al., 1990

). The error of the estimate has been reported to range from approximately 3–6% BF (

Ratamess, 2010

).




In summary, %BF and fat-free mass can be estimated adequately for screening and tracking moderate changes in body composition through field measures. On a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (unacceptable) based on precision, objectivity, and accuracy,
 
Going and Davis (2001)

 have ranked the different techniques as follows:



Skinfolds 2.5 (good to very good)


Bioelectrical impedance 2.5 (good to very good)


Circumferences 3.0 (good)


BMI 4.0 (fair)

Overweight and Obesity




Although being overweight is what bothers most people, it is really the amount and location of fat (%BF, abdominal fat mass) that should be of concern. Excess weight can be caused by high levels of lean muscle mass, but additional muscle mass is beneficial. Except in rare instances, such as providing protection from the cold water for an English Channel swimmer or certain wasting diseases, excess fat is generally not beneficial.



There are no universally agreed upon acceptable %BF standards. The most typically used normal values for young adults (20–29 years) are 12–15% for males and 22–25% for females with an allowance of an additional 2% for each decade of age. Using these ranges, obesity is then defined as +5% BF above the normal value (

Kaminsky and Dwyer, 2006

).





Figure 7.10

 shows a wider range of standards based on age, sex, and athletic participation (

Lohman et al., 1997

). Note that some increase in %BF with age has also been built in for individuals ≥35 years. This was based on studies showing that low or reduced body fat (especially in middle-aged females) is associated with lower bone mineral content. Thus, to maximize the goal of overall health, a balance must be reached between protecting against heart disease (associated with excessive fatness) and osteoporosis and bone fractures (associated with excessive leanness) (

Kaminsky and Dwyer, 2006

). Note also that there is no category representing overweight in this figure (because this is based on body fat not weight), but there is a break between each recommended range and the start of the corresponding obesity range. Individuals whose %BF falls in this area (as well as the obese range) should reduce %BF.










FIGURE 7.10
 Percent Body Fat Standards for Adult Males and Females.
 Ranges of acceptable %BF and %BF values representing obesity are presented for adult women and men by age and athletic status. Note that the athletic standards begin at the upper limit of essential fat: 5% for men and 12% for women. This coincides with the acceptable minimal value for men. Women have an acceptable minimal range that encompasses part of the essential fat range. Source

What Happens to Adipose Cells in Obesity? The Cellular Basis of Obesit
y


Human adipose cells can either be white, brown, or beige. White adipose tissue is composed of a matrix of connective tissue in which white adipose cells (adipocytes) appear singularly or in small clusters. A typical cell (Figure 7.11
) looks something like a signet ring, a metal band with a stone or jewel at the top. The nucleus of the cell appears as the stone or jewel of the ring in the cell membrane, which forms the band of the ring. The triglyceride droplets are stored in the space within the confines of the cell that provides nutrients mainly for other cells. Brown and beige adipose cells (Figure 7.11) also store trigylcerides but in many small fat droplets. Brown and beige adipose cells contain abundant mitochondria with brown cells having more and larger mitochondria than beige cells. These abundant mitochondria use the lipid fuels as well as glucose to warm the body rather than produced ATP. Brown and beige adipose cells per se are not involved in overweight or obesity as most of the fat stored in the human body is stored in white adipose cells. Brown and beige adipose cells are discussed more fully in Chapter 8.









FIGURE 7.11
 Adipose Cells.
 White, brown and beige adipose cells all store lipid as triglyceride, but do so in slightly different ways. White adipose cells contain one large fat droplet; brown adipose cells contain many small fat droplets; beige adipose cells contain fewer adipose droplets than brown, but they are somewhat larger. Brown adipose cells have the largest number of mitochondria, followed by beige; white adipose cells have the fewest mitochondria. Source:

An adult of acceptable weight has about 30–50 billion white fat cells. Mature adipocytes are among the largest cells in the body. They become plumper or more wrinkled as they take up or release fat. Females have approximately 50% more fat cells than do males. Adipocytes can become up to 10 times larger if needed to store triglycerides. Apparently, this increase in size (hypertrophy) is how increasing levels of fat are first stored. Sometimes, when the fat cell size is enlarged, the increased size causes a bulging between the fibrous tissue strands, causing a dimply, waffled appearance. These lumpy areas are often referred to as
 cellulite
. Cellulite, however, is simply fat (

Björntorp, 1987

,
 
1989

).




Once the upper limit of fat storage by hypertrophy is approached (somewhere around 30 kg of fat), fat cell hyperplasia occurs.
 Hyperplasia
 in general is growth in a tissue or organ through an increase in the number of cells. Fat tissue hyperplasia involves the development of new adipocytes from immature precursor cells. Adipocytes

 themselves do not divide and multiply, but hypertrophy in adipocytes stimulates cell division and maturation in precursor cells (Malina et al., 2004). Thus, a newly overweight adult is likely to have the same number of fat cells as when he or she was of normal weight, but these adipocytes will be larger than before. An obese individual may have enlarged adipocytes, an increased number of adipocytes, or both. Obese individuals may have as many as 75–80 billion fat cells. Once created, fat cell numbers are not naturally reduced, even if body weight and body fat are lost (

Sjöström and Björntorp, 1974

). Liposuction—the surgical removal of adipose tissue—is the only way to get rid of adipocytes. The maintenance of large numbers of adipocytes may be one reason why it is so difficult for obese individuals to maintain a weight/fat loss once it has been achieved.






Hyperplasia
 Growth in a tissue or organ through an increase in the number of cells.





These facts emphasize the importance of preventing the maturation of extra fat cells. Overweight or obese infants, children, or adolescents tend to become overweight or obese adults, although adolescent obesity is more predictive of adult obesity than is obesity at birth or in infancy (

Charney et al., 1975

;
 
Dietz, 1987

;
 
Lohman, 1989

;
 
Simmonds, 2015

).





Figure 7.12

 indicates the typical pattern of changes in adipose cell size (

Figure 7.12A

) and number (

Figure 7.12B

) that occurs in normal (nonobese) children and adolescents (Malina et al., 2004). From birth to young adulthood, the average adipose cell size doubles or even triples. Most of this increase in size happens during the first year after birth. From 1 year to the onset of puberty, there is no significant increase in size and no sex difference. At puberty, adipose cell size increases in females but remains fairly constant in males. Not all adipose cells are of the same size; internal (visceral) fat cells are generally smaller than subcutaneous fat cells. Furthermore, not all subcutaneous cells are equal in size. For example, gluteal adipocytes tend to be larger than abdominal adipocytes, which in turn are larger than subscapular cells.










FIGURE 7.12
 Adipose Cell Size and Number Changes with Growth.
 A.
 The greatest change in adipose cell size occurs between birth and 1 year. Until approximately age 10, cell size is similar in males and females. After age 10, the difference between males and females gradually widens, and individual variations (indicated by the vertical lines) become more apparent. B.
 The number of adipose cells gradually increases through the childhood years in males and females at a similar rate. At approximately age 10, in both sexes, the rate of increase in fat cell number accelerates, but females far exceed males. Individual differences indicated by vertical bars (labeled SD for standard deviation) increase considerably with age. Source

At birth, the number of adipocytes is approximately 5 billion. For the number to increase to the average adult value of 30 billion, considerable change must occur. However, little increase in number occurs during the first year after birth when the cell size is changing so drastically (

Figure 7.12B

). From 1 year to the onset of puberty, there is a gradual but steady increase in the number of adipocytes, with no difference appearing between the sexes. This gradual increase can double or even triple the number of fat cells. At puberty, the number of adipose cells increases greatly in both males and females, but the female increase far exceeds the male increase. This increase in fat cell number plateaus in late adolescence/early adulthood and ideally remains at that level. In reality, however, hyperplasia can and often does occur in adulthood (Malina et al., 2004). Thus, although there are two critical periods—infancy and adolescence—in the development of adipocytes, this should not be interpreted as meaning that fat cells cannot be added during adulthood.




Some individuals produce more adipocytes than do others during growth, and this can amount to billions of cells. During the growth changes, males tend to accumulate more subcutaneous fat on the trunk and females on the extremities.



Fat Distribution Patterns


The location of fat storage varies among individuals. In general, fat is distributed in three basic patterns: android, gynoid, and intermediate patterns (Figure 7.13
). The android pattern
 (Figure 7.13A
), also known as the abdominal or apple pattern, is predominately found in males. It is
 characterized by the storage of fat in the nape of the neck, shoulders, and abdomen (upper part of the body). In this pattern, the largest quantity of fat is stored internally, not subcutaneously, and the trunk area has the greatest amount of subcutaneous fat. The result is the classic potbelly shape. Individuals with potbellies often make the claim that they are not fat and occasionally challenge others to hit them in the stomach as hard as possible to prove their superior musculature. In fact, the hardness of the abdominal region is caused by the excess fat in the abdominal cavity pushing against the abdominal muscles and stretching them taut, not by muscle tone or hypertrophy. The amount of intra-abdominal (visceral) fat is twice as high in android obesity as gynoid obesity (Blouin et al., 2008
; Campaigne, 1990
; Stamford, 1991
).









FIGURE 7.13
 Patterns of Fat Distribution.

 Android, B.

The
 gynoid pattern
 (

Figure 7.13B

), also called the gluteofemoral or pear pattern, is found predominantly in females. It is characterized by the storage of fat in the lower part of the body, specifically, in the thighs and buttocks, with the largest quantity being stored subcutaneously. No pseudohardness is apparent. These sites tend to be soft and tend to jiggle (

Campaigne, 1990

;
 
Stamford, 1991

).




It is thought that the deposition of fat in the gluteal-femoral region in females is linked to the reproductive function. In particular, gluteal-femoral fat may furnish energy for the development of the fetus, primarily during the latter stages of pregnancy, and for the newborn child during lactation. As would be expected, these fat deposits are controlled by the steroid hormones.




The third type of fat pattern is known simply as the
 intermediate pattern
 (

Figure 7.13C

). In this pattern, fat is stored in both the upper and the lower parts of the body, giving a somewhat rectangular cubic appearance. Note that all three patterns are found in both males and females, despite the sex-specific predominance associated with android and gynoid shapes (

Campaigne, 1990

;
 
Stamford, 1991

). With menopause, female fat distribution typically changes from a gynoid to an android pattern (

Després and Lamarche, 2000

;
 
Rosano et al., 2007

).




Abdominal adipose tissue (in subcutaneous and visceral depots) is the primary site for immediate storage of diet-derived fat. During weight gain, these adipose cells undergo hypertrophy, and because their number does not expand, they have a finite storage capacity. The lifespan of abdominal adipocytes is approximately 10 years with a 10% turnover each year (

Karpe and Pinnick, 2015

). Abdominal fat deposits are easily mobilized; therefore, it is possible to reduce fat accumulation in this area relatively easily (assuming a caloric deficit). Conversely, gluteal-femoral fat deposits respond to weight gain by hyperplasia, and their contents are not easily mobilized. Thus, it is not possible to reduce fat accumulation in these areas easily. The potential for reshaping the gluteofemoral fat pattern is extremely limited (

Campaigne, 1990

;
 
Stamford, 1991

). In one study that measured areas of fat loss from caloric restriction in overweight young females, those with an android distribution of fat lost more weight and showed a greater decrease in waist circumference and a greater intra-abdominal fat loss than did those with a gynoid fat distribution (

Jones and Edwards, 1999

).




The reason behind the variation in the fat deposit mobilization is hormonally based (

Wong et al., 2003

). Two different receptors, alpha and beta, have been identified in fat cells; they vary in their ability to facilitate or inhibit fat incorporation into the cell or fat mobilization out of the cell. Alpha-receptors inhibit fat transfer to and from the adipocytes, and beta-receptors enhance these

 transfers. Enzyme activity is concomitantly increased or decreased. Alpha-receptors predominate in the lower body and are thus more abundant in the gynoid pattern. Beta-receptors are concentrated in the upper body and are more abundant in the android pattern. Thus, the adipose cells in the abdominal region are more unstable.




Epinephrine (released from the adrenal medulla) binds to beta-receptors on adipose tissue and causes lipids (fatty acids) to be mobilized from the abdominal cells and released into the circulatory system. If the free fatty acids and glycerol can be used (directly or indirectly) as fuel to support exercise, there is no problem. However, when epinephrine is released in times of emotional stress and there is no need for the excess fuel, the fatty acids and glycerol are then routed to the liver, where they are detrimentally deposited or converted to very low-density lipoproteins and small dense LDL-Cs increasing the risk of coronary heart disease (

Després and Lamarche, 2000

).




In addition, abdominal fat cells tend to be larger than the fat cells found in other parts of the body. Larger abdominal (android) fat cells are associated with glucose intolerance (the inability to dispose of a glucose load effectively), coupled with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and an excess of insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinemia). These conditions are associated with diabetes mellitus (a coronary heart disease [CAD] risk factor) and hypertension (a CAD risk factor). The latter occurs because of the action of insulin in promoting reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys (

Brownell et al., 1987

;
 
Campaigne, 1990

;
 
Stamford, 1991

). Conversely, the smaller thigh-hip (gynoid) fat cells are highly insulin sensitive. After a fatty meal when circulating triglycerides are broken down by these cells, the resulting fatty acids tend to be stored immediately. This keeps them out of circulation and avoids the conversion to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (

McCarty, 2003

). Finally, visceral adipose tissue releases over 120 hormones and factors called adipokines or adipocytokines. Most of these factors are involved in the pathological development of inflammation, atherosclerosis, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. These are important components in the development of the metabolic syndrome (discussed later) (

Hutley and Prins, 2005

;
 
Lyon et al., 2003

;
 
Wong et al., 2003

). Between the two major fat distribution types, these factors result in the gynoid pattern being associated with a lower risk and the android pattern with a higher risk of myocardial infarctions, stroke, and metabolic syndrome components (

Kang et al., 2011

;
 
Toss et al., 2011

;
 
Wiklund et al., 2010

). New data suggest that the profound functional differences between gynoid and android fat are controlled by site-specific developmental genes (

Karpe and Pinnick, 2015

).
 
Table 7.6

 summarizes the differences between android and gynoid fat patterns.




Simply looking in the mirror while naked is probably the best way to determine whether you are android, gynoid, or intermediate in terms of fat distribution, although the calculation of the waist circumference and W/H ratio might also be useful. High ratios reflect a larger waist and thus more upper body fat deposition (android shape) than lower body hip fat deposition.

 presents an image of visceral abdominal tissue. This particular image was produced by a

 CT scan. MRI is also frequently used in laboratory studies. These imaging techniques directly measure fat tissue. As previously mentioned, measuring waist circumference is the best field technique for estimating abdominal obesity.

Figure 7.15

 presents the results of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) conducted on adults aged 20–79 years indicating the mean waist circumference and prevalence of age-adjusted abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity was defined as

 greater than 102 cm for males and greater than 88 cm for females. Both males and females show a steady increase in the average waist circumference from 1960–1962 to 1999–2000 and then more moderate increases. The male average has remained below the cutoff for abdominal obesity, but the female averages from 1988–1994 through 2011–2012 are above the cutoff. The age-adjusted prevalence has followed the same trends, increasing sharply from 1960–1962 to 1999–2000 and then more gradually, until in 2011–2012, 43.5% of males and 64.7% of females exhibited abdominal obesity (

Ford et al., 2014

;
 
Okosun et al., 2004

). The prevalence of abdominal obesity in children and adolescents 2–18 years as defined by waist circumference greater than or equal to the sex- and age-specific 90th percentile based on NHANES III (1988–1994) is 18.87%, but this has been steady since 2003–2004 (

Xi et al., 2014

).

Health Risks of Overweight and Obesity


In 2013, the American Medical Association declared obesity a disease in and of itself. There are three common criteria for defining a disease. The first is an impairment of normal function of some aspect of the body. In obesity, there is an impaired functioning of appetite regulation, energy balance, endocrine function, and blood pressure to name a few. The second is the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. For obesity, the increase in body fat is obvious, but, for example, joint pain, immobility, and sleep apnea are also evident. The third criterion is harm or morbidity. The fat mass of obesity is directly related to hypertension, cardiovascular-respiratory diseases, some cancers, and other comorbidities.



A 2015 study completed at the Brookings Institute shows that the lifetime societal and health cost of obesity computed from direct medical costs, absenteeism, short-term disability payments, and lost tax revenue is on average $92,235 more per person when compared with the costs for an individual of normal weight. Using this estimate if all 12.7 million youth with obesity become obese adults, the cost over their lifetime may exceed $1.1 trillion. A second analysis done in 2014 at the National Center for Weight & Wellness at George Washington University estimates the total cost of obesity at $305.1 billion annually (

www.thefiscaltimes.com

). Worldwide in 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3.4 million deaths, 3.9% of years of life lost, and 3.8% of disability-adjusted life-years (

Ng et al., 2014

).





Table 7.7

 provides a listing of risk factors and diseases divided into those that result from metabolic changes caused by obesity and those that results from the increased mass of fat per se (

Bray, 2000

). Among equally obese individuals, those with the highest accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) show the severest deterioration in metabolic variables (

Després and Lamarche, 2000

). VAT appears to have a stronger relationship with physiological and pathological processes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiometabolic risk factors than total body fat and/or abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue do (

Demerath et al., 2008

;
 
Liu et al., 2010

;
 
Sardinha and Teixeira, 2005

). Several of these diseases and/or risk factors are discussed below.




TABLE 7.6
 Patterns of Fat Distribution






Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)


Excess body weight and fat has a strong direct relationship with elevated blood pressure (Bray, 1987
; Burton et al., 1985
; Lee et al., 2007
; Pi-Sunyer, 1993
). Hypertension is also a very strong and independent risk factor for coronary heart disease.

Childhood Obesity and CVD Risk Factors






A total of 1,166 White (C) and 1,213 African American (AA) girls were tested in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health
 Study annually between ages 9 or 10 years and 18 years and were contacted for self-reported measures at age 21–23 years. At the time the study began, BMI values above the CDC’s age-specific 95th percentile were labeled as overweight. Because these values are now labeled obese, the term obesity will be used here. Young adult obesity was defined as a BMI ≥ 30 kg·m−2
.







The rate of obesity increased throughout adolescence from 7 to 10% in the C girls and from 17 to 24% in the AA girls (not shown). Graph A shows the percent of new-onset cases (incidence) of obesity by race over the age span. The incidence ranged from 2 to 5% through age 12, after which the annual increase was generally in the 1–2% range. The important part of this information is the fact that it is the so-called tween years (ages 9–12 years) when girls are especially at risk of getting fat. Thus, particular attention and intervention should be directed toward this age group to prevent the increase in body weight and fat.








Graph B shows the percentage of selected cardiovascular risk factors in the C and AA groups combined, based on being or not being obese. Girls who were obese were 3–10 times as likely as those who were not obese to be assessed as “at risk” on four of the six cardiovascular risk factors: unhealthful levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglyceride levels. The increased risk was already evident at age 9 years. Thus, there are meaningful health reasons for not delaying interventions.








Graph C shows the percentage of obese girls in young adulthood who were obese or not at each age in childhood. For example, 71.3% of the obese 9-year-olds were obese at approximately 21 years, but only 10.3% of the nonobese at age 9 were obese at approximately 21 years. Overall, girls who were obese during childhood were 11 to 30 times more likely to be obese in young adulthood. Given that the height and weight values were self-reported by the young adults, and underreporting weight is a known problem, the risk could be even greater. These data clearly show that obesity tracks from childhood to adulthood and needs to be addressed with children.

Cardiovascular-Respiratory Diseases


A longitudinal study has been investigating the risk factors for heart disease in cohorts of more than 15,000 residents of Framingham, Massachusetts, since 1948. Data from years of follow-up have shown that overweight or obesity is a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and glucose tolerance. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for atrial fibrillation in the heart, which in turn is a risk factor for cerebrovascular stroke. Based on this extensive data set, the Framingham investigators have concluded that if everyone were at or within 10% of his or her desirable weight, there would be 25% less coronary heart disease and 35% less congestive heart failure and stroke. The risk is greater for those who become obese early in life, as in childhood, rather than in old age (Bray, 1987
; Burton et al., 1985
; Lee et al., 2007
; Pi-Sunyer, 1993
; Simopoulos, 1987
; Wang et al., 2004
). Worldwide, the trends are similar. Epidemiological studies from not only the United States but also Europe and Asia have found that higher BMI values are significantly associated with increased incidence of coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke (Yatsuya et al., 2014
).



A 2012 meta-analysis found that waist circumference had the strongest relationship with all CVD risk factors studied for both males and females, except HDL and LDL in males (

van Dijk et al., 2012

).




A study of 276,835 Dutch children showed that higher BMI values during childhood (7–13 years of age) were associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in adulthood. The associations were stronger in boys than girls and increased as the child became older in both sexes (

Baker et al., 2007

). Among other things, the Focus on Research: Clinically Relevant box provides evidence of increased CVD risk factors in female children

 and adolescents with BMI values greater than the 95th percentile (

Thompson et al., 2007

).




As mentioned previously, the risk is higher for those who store their fat in the android pattern than in the gynoid pattern. While coronary heart disease is linked to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia (primarily metabolic changes), congestive heart failure is more related to the increase in total fat mass per se. A larger body mass increases circulatory demand, including an elevation in the cardiac output often operating against an elevated systemic vascular resistance induced by hypertension (

Arciero and Nindl, 2004

).




The increased sizes of the chest and abdomen in obese individuals alter respiratory patterns leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatches and predisposing the individual to hypoxia (too little oxygen) and carbon dioxide retention. Airway obstruction often leads to sleep apnea (absence of spontaneous breathing). If uncontrolled, this can lead to sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias (

Arciero and Nindl, 2004

).



Gallbladder Disease and Hypercholesterolemia (High Cholesterol)


In the Framingham study, individuals who were 20% or more above the average weight for their height were about twice as likely to develop gallbladder disease as those who were 10% less than the average weight. In another study, the frequency of gallbladder disease was largely explained by weight, age, and, in females, the number of viable pregnancies (parity). Obese females between ages 20 and 30 years had a 600% greater chance of having gallbladder disease than did average-weight females. Within all age groups, the frequency of gallbladder disease increased with body weight. The body weight of males with gallstones has also been shown to be significantly more than the body weight of males without gallstones (Bray, 1987
; Pi-Sunyer, 1993
).



Increased gallbladder disease in overweight or obese individuals can be at least partly explained by the effect of increased body weight and fat on cholesterol. Fatness has a significant positive relationship with cholesterol level. Cholesterol production is also related to body weight, such that 1 excess kg of body weight increases cholesterol production by 20–22 mg·dL
−1
. Bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder and always contains some cholesterol. The bile of obese individuals is more saturated with cholesterol than is that of nonobese individuals. This increased presence of cholesterol in bile is the likely cause of the increased risk of gallbladder disease (

Arciero and Nindl, 2004

;
 
Bray, 1987

).




The prevalence of adverse lipid profiles (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and high triglycerides [TG]) is higher in obese adults and high in overweight adults compared to normal-weight adults. They are highest in adults with elevated abdominal obesity (

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, 2015

).



Diabetes Mellitus


Diabetes is a disorder of carbohydrate (glucose) metabolism. Overweight or obesity appears to cause an increase in insulin resistance and deterioration in glucose tolerance (leading to high levels of blood glucose) and to aggravate the appearance of diabetes. The risk for developing diabetes mellitus increases with the degree of obesity and age of the individual. This is also linked to the increased levels of circulating fatty acids that are evident in the obese. Visceral abdominal tissue is more strongly associated with insulin resistance than abdominal subcutaneous fat (Arciero and Nindl, 2004
; Bray, 1987
; Burton et al., 1985
; Pi-Sunyer, 1993
; Preis et al., 2010
).


Cancer


The American Cancer Society has published data on 750,000 individuals studied between 1959 and 1972. In these studies, as BMI increased, so did the incidence of death from cancer, even independent of cigarette smoking. Overweight males were particularly susceptible to prostate and colorectal cancer; overweight females showed increased rates of breast, cervical, endometrial, uterine, and ovarian cancer. Waist circumference is independently and positively associated with both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk (White et al., 2015
). The suspected link, at least for females, is the level of estrogen. Adipose tissue is a site for estrogen formation in all females and the major site in postmenopausal females. Estrogen formation is increased in overweight and obese individuals owing to the increased number of adipose cells (Bray, 1987
; Charney et al., 1975
; Pi-Sunyer, 1993
; Simopoulos, 1987
).


Metabolic Syndrome


The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin that directly promote the development of atherosclerotic CVD and increase the individual’s risk of diabetes. Clinical identification of MS in adults includes three or more of the following: abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low high–density-lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, and insulin resistance. In an analysis of NHANES data from 2003 to 2006, the prevalence of MS increased with increasing BMI for both sexes. That is, only 7% of underweight and normal-weight males and 9% of underweight and normal-weight females were diagnosed with MS, whereas 30% of overweight males, 33% of overweight females, 65% of obese males for MS than normal weight individuals, and 56% of obese females met the criteria. Overweight males were six times more likely to meet the criteria for MS than normal weight individuals, overweight females were 5.5 times as likely; obese males were 32 times more likely to meet the criteria for MS than normal weight individuals, and obese females were 17 times as likely (Ervin, 2009
).



A recent analysis of adolescents (12–19 years) in the NHANES database (1999–2008) revealed that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in obese youth was approximately 7% for overweight and 35% for obese boys and 9.2% for overweight and approximately 25% for obese girls versus less than 2% in the normal-weight groups. The odds of MS for overweight boys was approximately 9 times and for obese boys were 67 times that of normal-weight boys, whereas for overweight girls, the odds were 6 times for overweight and 19 times greater than for normal-weight girls (

Laurson et al., 2014

).



Miscellaneous Disorders


In addition to the specific diseases just discussed, overweight or obesity has been linked to kidney and liver dysfunction, joint problems (osteoarthritis) including back pain and gout, endocrine disorders including reproductive problems, problematic response to anesthetics for surgery, skin infections, and an impaired physical work capacity (ACSM, 1983
; Aune et al., 2014
; Pi-Sunyer, 1993
). The increased prevalence of these diseases and problems applies to adults, but overweight or obese children also show increased risk factors, though not the actual diseases, compared with normal-weight children (Williams et al., 1992
).



The diseases discussed in the preceding sections lead to increased mortality or decreased longevity. In and of itself, visceral fat is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in males (

Kuk et al., 2005

). The associations between underweight, overweight, and obesity per se with these diseases and mortality are somewhat more complex.

 Health Risks Associated with Overweight/Obesity










FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Physical Activity/Physical Fitness and the Health Risks of Obesity






Epidemiological evidence indicates that
 there is a relationship between high physical activity/physical fitness and lower health risks of overweight/obesity. The health risks of overweight and obesity have been detailed in this chapter. It is well established that one way to reduce these health risks is to lose body weight and, more specifically, body fat. However, it is also well established that this is easier said than done, and the same is true for maintaining a weight loss that has been achieved. So, the question becomes whether physical activity or physical fitness can weaken or blunt the increased risk of morbidity or mortality in overweight/obese individuals who remain overweight or obese.







The compiled results of three studies shed some light on this question. These studies were conducted at the Institute for Aerobics Research, Cooper Clinic (Dallas, TX), and are based on approximately 22,000 males aged 20–60 years and 2,600 males and females over the age of 60 years. The results presented in the accompanying graph for males aged 20–60 years clearly show that regardless of how body composition is measured (BMI—using 27.8 kg·m
−2
 as the cutoff between normal and obese males, %BF, or waist girth), overweight or obese males who are fit have a lower risk of all-cause mortality (early death from all causes) than do unfit males (

Blair and Brodney, 1999

;
 
Welk and Blair, 2000

). Indeed, the fit obese males had much less risk of early death than did unfit lean males. This can be seen in the figure by comparing the red bars (fit), which have a relative risk (RR) of approximately 1.0, to the blue bars (unfit), where the RR ranges from 1.62 to 4.88. These higher-risk ratios mean that the unfit are 62% to almost 500% more likely to suffer early death than are the fit, regardless of body composition. In addition, the risk of all-cause mortality is similar for fit individuals, regardless of their body composition: lean, normal, or obese, that is, the adjusted RR for the fit groups deviated only slightly from 1.0 (0.8 to 1.08, which indicates no excessive risk), regardless of body composition (

Blair and Brodney, 1999

;
 
Welk and Blair, 2000

).








Fitness in these studies was determined by a maximal treadmill test, and only the individuals in the bottom 20% (by age-specific distribution) were classified as unfit. In absolute values, this level of cardiovascular fitness is equivalent to a
 

 of 35 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 for 20- to 39-year-old males and 33 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 for 40- to 59-year-old males. These fitness levels can be achieved by as little as 400–1,650 kcal of activity per week. This energy expenditure is consistent with 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week.








A 2007 study (

Sui et al., 2007

) from the same laboratory using the same testing procedures extended these results to individuals more than 60 years of age including approximately 20% females. One change was that individuals were divided into four groups by BMI to match the new standards: 18.5–24.9 kg·m
−2
 (normal), 25.0–29.9 kg·m
−2
 (overweight), 30–34.9 kg·m
−2
 (level I obesity), and greater than 35 kg·m
−2
 (level II and III obesity). The upper limit of normal %BF was maintained at 25% for males and set at 30% for females. Death rates per 1,000 person-years, adjusted for age, sex, and examination year, were 32.6, 16.6, 12.8, 12.3, and 8.1 from the lowest to the highest quintiles of fitness. That is, the lowest 20% of this population based on
 

 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 had the highest death rate. Higher fitness was linked to lower risk of death due to all causes. This was true in both normal and overweight BMI groups, for participants with normal waist size, abdominal obesity, normal %BF, and excessive fat. However, fit individuals who were obese (BMI = 30–34.9 kg·m
−2
, had abdominal obesity, or had excessive %BF) had a lower risk of all-cause mortality than unfit, normal-weight, or lean individuals.








The implications for health promotion are clear. There are health risks associated with overweight and obesity, and the advice to lose weight remains sound. Weight loss remains one of the primary reasons individuals join a health club or exercise program. Many overweight/obese individuals, however, become frustrated when the desired weight loss does not happen or does not happen rapidly enough for whatever reason, and they quickly drop out of the exercise regimen. These individuals should be encouraged to remain or become more active in order to reap the physiological benefits of regular activity both separate from and linked to increasing physical fitness. The process of being active and becoming physically fit, rather than the product of changes in body weight or percent fat, should be stressed. Emphasizing the process is more likely to motivate overweight/obese individuals because participation in activity is within each person’s control (

Gaesser et al., 2015

;
 
Welk and Blair, 2000

). If the process (regular physical activity) is accomplished, the product (physical fitness/lower health risks) will follow.

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






The Impact of Fatness on Fitness






While the previous Focus on Application box has shown that cardiovascular fitness positively impacts the health
 risks of overweight and obesity, the interaction of these two variables can be viewed in another way: how does fatness impact fitness? More specifically, do the increasing overweight/obesity levels of children and adolescents explain the decline in cardiovascular fitness that is now evident? Considerable evidence worldwide supports the contention that aerobic fitness is decreasing and body fatness increasing in children and adolescents. Variability in fatness is known to account for approximately 20% of the variability in running performance, but are the changes in fatness totally responsible for the changes in aerobic fitness?







In this report, Australians aged 10–12 tested in 1985 were matched by age, sex, BMI, and triceps skinfold to children tested in 1997 (N = 279 matched pairs from a total sample of 2,748 participants) on the 1.6-km run (also known as the metric mile). Similarly, 12–15-year-olds tested in 1995–1996 were matched with adolescents tested in 1999–2000 on the 20-m shuttle run (20 MST) (also known as the PACER) (N = 2,834 matched pairs from a total sample of 7,938 participants).








The accompanying graph shows the decrement in performance in the total samples for both of the fitness run tests. The values for the 1.6-km run were approximately −7% to −8% and those for the 20 MST −2% to −3%. The lesser decline for the 20 MST is undoubtedly due to the shorter time between the testing sessions (4 years versus 12 years) for that test compared with the 1.6-km run. The differences for the matched samples are less than the total samples. In the 1.6-km run, the differences in fitness performance were reduced by 61% and 37% for boys and girls, respectively, by matching for BMI and skinfold thickness. For the 20 MST, the reductions for matching were 46% for boys and 29% for girls. In the matched sample statistical technique, if the declines in running performance seen in the total group had been eliminated in the matched sample, then these fitness declines could have been attributed solely to increases in fatness. However, this clearly did not happen.








These results are of more than just theoretical interest. If the goal is to reverse the decline in fitness (which it certainly should be), it is important to know whether it is due only to increases in fatness, in which case weight reduction strategies alone are called for, or whether other factors are also important. The data indicate that other factors, such as reduced physical activity and a subsequent detraining effect, are likely to have contributed to the decline. This suggests that increasing physical activity levels in conjunction with dietary strategies is needed to improve aerobic fitness.

The Obesity Paradox


A paradox is something contrary to what is expected, and the obesity paradox
 refers to the fact that while obesity is linked with higher health risk and mortality, in certain chronic disease states, overweight and/or obesity appears to confer a survival advantage. Among these chronic disease states are coronary artery disease (after intervention), heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, and end-stage renal disease/dialysis (McAuley and Blair, 2011
). Some obese individuals have normal cardiometabolic risk profiles, and some do not. The obesity paradox has been an evolving concept.




Flegal et al. (2005)

 estimated the relative risk of mortality (death) associated with different levels of BMI (underweight = BMI < 18.5 kg·m
−2
; overweight = BMI 25 to <30 kg·m
−2
; obese = BMI ≥ 30 kg·m
−2
) using data from NHANES I (1971–1975), II (1976–1980 with follow-up through 1992), and III (1988–1994 with follow-up through 2000). Underweight and obesity were associated with increased mortality relative to normal weight. However, overweight was not associated with excess mortality. The authors speculated that improvements in public health and medical care may have been responsible for this positive outcome for those who are overweight. Two subsequent studies extended the follow-up to 2004 and found similar results. In the first study (

Flegal et al., 2007

), which used the same databases with a longer follow-up, underweight was linked with increased mortality from noncancer or non-CVD (primarily respiratory related) but not with cancer or CVD mortality. Obesity was linked with significantly increased mortality from CVD and obesity-related cancers (colon, breast, esophageal, uterine, ovarian, kidney, and pancreatic), but not with other cancers, noncancer, or non-CVD mortality. Overweight and obesity combined were linked with
 increased
 mortality from diabetes and kidney disease. However, overweight and obesity combined were also linked with
 decreased
 mortality from noncancer or non-CVD causes. Overweight in and of itself was not linked with cancer or CVD mortality and was linked significantly with decreased mortality from noncancer or non-CVD causes. This time, the authors speculated that the greater nutritional reserves of being moderately overweight may be associated with improved survival during recovery from situations such as infections or surgeries. Additionally, some proportion of the individuals classified as overweight based on BMI could actually be in a healthy range for %BF due to a larger amount of LBM. The second study (

McAuley et al., 2007

) using data from military veterans found that obesity was associated with substantially lower mortality risk in non–heart failure individuals.




A 2013 meta-analysis of 97 studies on a combined sample of 2.88 million individuals found that relative to normal weight (as assessed by BMI) all grades of obesity and only grades 2 and 3 combined obesity had an 18 and 29% significantly higher all-cause mortality relative to normal-weight individuals. However, grade 1 obesity alone was not associated with higher mortality, and overweight was associated with 6% significantly lower all-cause mortality (

Flegal et al., 2013

). Possible explanations included the greater likelihood of overweight and moderately obese individuals seeking earlier medical assistance and the benefits of higher metabolic reserves. What has been missing in this progression of studies is any measure of cardiorespiratory fitness.




The Focus on Application Box: Physical Activity/Physical Fitness and the Health Risks of Obesity describes several studies on the interaction between fitness, fatness, and mortality. In addition, a study by
 
McAuley and Beavers (2014)

 dealt specifically with patient populations. Five observational studies of 30,104 patients with cardiovascular disease (87% male) were analyzed, and results indicated that cardiorespiratory fitness significantly altered the obesity paradox. Among patients with high cardiorespiratory fitness, risk of all-cause mortality was lowest for the overweight category in some, but not all, of these studies. This suggested to the authors that higher levels of fitness may modify the relationship between body fatness and survival. Thus, higher levels of fitness may improve the prognosis for survival, and this is no paradox—high fitness should lower mortality rates.




A meta-analysis on the impact of fitness versus fatness on all-cause mortality found that the unfit individuals had twice the risk of death as the fit individuals, regardless of BMI. Conversely, fit, overweight, and obese individuals all had similar mortality risk as their normal-weight counterparts. The risk of death was dependent on cardiovascular fitness and not BMI (

Barry et al., 2014

).




In general, lean unfit patients with CVD have a worse prognosis than do overweight or obese high-fit individuals because of the impact of fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a powerful risk modifier that explains, at least in part, the obesity paradox (

Lavie et al., 2014a

,
 
2014b

;
 
McAuley and Beavers, 2014

;
 
McAuley and Blair, 2011

).




Of course, developing a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness for an individual who is overweight or overfat is not easy. The Focus on Application Box: The Impact of Fatness on Fitness shows that more than just fatness has led to a decrease in children’s aerobic fitness levels.





SUMMARY





1.
 In the United States in the early 1970s, the prevalence of obesity was 4–6% for children/adolescents and 15% for adults. In 2011–2012, 34.9% of US adults were obese as were 16.9% of US children and adolescents and 8.1% of infants and toddlers

.




2.
 The major reference techniques for determining body composition are cadaver analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although a multicomponent model typically measuring densitometry, bone mineral by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and hydrometry is preferred, hydrostatic, or underwater, weighing by itself is frequently used in laboratory situations for the determination of body composition. It is based on densitometry. Air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are also important laboratory techniques.




3.
 Densitometry usually divides the body into two components, fat and fat-free weight (FFW). FFW is composed of water, protein, and bone mineral. The components are known and are relatively stable in adults but not in children and adolescents. Thus, no single equation, and especially not the adult equations of Brozek or Siri, can be used for children.




4.
 Important field tests for assessing body composition and/or abdominal obesity include skinfolds (good to very good assessments), bioelectrical impedance (good to very good), height and weight indices (especially body mass index [BMI]) (fair), and waist circumference (good). BMI is associated with, but does not actually measure, %body fat and lean body mass.




5.
 Waist circumference is strongly related to visceral abdominal obesity, which in turn is predictive of morbidity and mortality.




6.
 The size and the number of adipocytes increase as a child grows to adulthood. Adult fat gain first involves hypertrophy of the adipocytes and then hyperplasia of precursor cells.




7.
 Fat is typically distributed in an android (abdominal), gynoid (hips and thighs), or intermediate pattern. The android pattern is more strongly linked with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Visceral adipose tissue appears to have a stronger relationship with physiological and pathological process than total body fat does.




8.
 In addition to being a disease itself, the health risks of overweight and obesity include CVD, hypertension, gallbladder disease, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Paradoxically, in some chronic disease states, overweight/obesity appears to confer a survival advantage. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a powerful modifier of cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese individuals and partially explains the obesity paradox.
