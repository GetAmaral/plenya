Introduction




Exercise training has many health benefits. Often, active individuals, perhaps yourself included, claim they feel better and are healthier than their sedentary friends. They claim these benefits not only just because they have altered their risk factors for major diseases but also because they have colds, flu, sore throats, and other common illnesses less often. On the other hand, one hears about Olympic and professional athletes competing despite an illness or, conversely, being unable to compete at all because of illness—not injury. Indeed, a common cause of poor physical performance at athletic events is acute respiratory infection. Acute respiratory conditions such as the common cold or influenza annually affect 90 out of 100 persons, causing substantial morbidity and economic cost. The relationship between exercise and immune function thus has important implications for public health and for athletes (Brolinson and Elliott, 2007
; Gleeson and Pyne, 2016
). In addition, many are interested in the role of exercise and exercise training in relation to diseases involving the immune system, such as cancer or HIV/AIDS. Does physical activity protect against certain cancers? Should individuals with disease be physically active?



Definitive answers to these questions are not yet possible. This chapter provides an overview of the functioning of the immune system, explores the acute immune response to exercise, considers adaptations in the immune system that occur as a result of exercise training, and, finally, addresses beneficial and detrimental influences of exercise on immune function and disease susceptibility.





The Immune System




Humans are constantly exposed to bacteria, viruses, and parasites capable of causing mild to serious disease. The fact that most of the time these foreign invaders do not overcome us is a testimony to the importance and efficiency of the body’s defense mechanisms, comprised primarily of the immune system. The immune system
 is a complex and precisely ordered system of cells, hormones, and chemicals that regulate susceptibility to, severity of, and recovery from infection and illness (Nash, 1994
). Immunology
 is the study of the body’s physiological responses to destroy or neutralize foreign matter (Smith, 1995
). The immune system operates with the nervous system and the endocrine system to maintain homeostasis. Although these systems operate independently, each with its own collection of highly specific cells and regulatory factors, they overlap considerably, and each system depends on the others for normal development and function (Pedersen et al., 2007
). These three interrelated systems interact in complex, bidirectional, anatomical, and physiological ways (Miles, 2005
) and are studied by the growing field known as psychoneuroimmunology or neuroimmunology.





Immune System
 A precisely ordered system of cells, hormones, and chemicals that regulate susceptibility to, severity of, and recovery from infection and illness.





In its organization and operation, the immune system parallels the nervous and endocrine systems. For example, all three systems consist of identifiable cells and chemical substances. All three systems react to stimuli; each has a network for communication within itself and with the other systems; and all three control and interact with other cells and organs. One major difference, however, is a gradient of mobility. The nervous system functions through fixed nerves and locally released neurotransmitters. The major endocrine glands are also fixed in place, but their hormones travel throughout the body, primarily via the bloodstream. The immune system consists primarily of free mobile cells that move within and outside the bloodstream, although some may be anatomically specific (

Roitt et al., 1998

).




As with the nervous and hormonal systems, one must understand the parts and processes of the immune system to understand how it functions.
 
Figure 22.1

 outlines the basics of the immune system. All immune responses involve recognizing a threat to the body and reacting to eradicate that threat while minimizing damage. The most common threat or stimulus to the immune system is an infectious microbe or pathogen; such microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, parasites, protozoa, and viruses. Some pathogens (all viruses, some bacteria, and small protozoan parasites) invade the body’s cells and replicate there, while others (most bacteria and larger parasites) reside primarily in body fluids and extracellular spaces. The site of the infection and the specific pathogen determine how the immune system responds. The immune system can also be stimulated by cellular damage, such as muscle damage. In this case, the goal of the immune response, mediated largely through the process of inflammation, is to bring immune cells to the site of local tissue damage to clear cellular debris and set the stage for tissue repair. Recent data also suggest that immune mediators play a role in regulating metabolism.

Structure and Function of the Immune System


Cells


The primary immune cells are leukocytes
 or white blood cells. Leukocytes are subdivided into lymphocytes
 and phagocytes
, each of which has three major subdivisions (Figure 22.1
).



B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) specifically recognize individual pathogens. Any pathogen that can be specifically recognized by B cells and/or T cells is called an
 antigen
. Both B cells and T cells are derived from bone marrow cells, but B cells mature in the bone marrow, whereas T cells mature in the thymus. Each B and T cell is genetically programmed to recognize only one particular antigen. Once an antigen is recognized,

 B cells proliferate into plasma cells that produce an antibody to act immediately and memory cells that will ultimately provide lasting immunity. Vaccinations confer immunity against diseases such as polio or measles by altering an antigen such that it becomes harmless but still brings about an antibody reaction.




Antigens recognized by T cells have been processed first in some way. Sensitized T cells enlarge and divide into two functionally separate classifications: CD8 cells, also called cytotoxic or killer cells, destroy infected cells directly. CD4 cells, which are helper or inducer cells, stimulate the action of cytotoxic cells and increase antibody production by B plasma cells. Through a variety of feedback mechanisms, both CD4 and CD8 cells can also act as suppressor T cells that inhibit cytotoxic T cells and antibody production, thus preventing excessive destruction (

Roitt et al., 1998

). Although they are classified as large granular lymphocytes,
 natural killer (NK) cells
 are different from other lymphocytes in that they act spontaneously against any target, apparently by recognizing surface changes on a variety of tumor cells and virally infected cells. As their name implies, these cells directly destroy infected host cells.




Phagocytes
 are leukocytes that bind to pathogenic microorganisms and antigens, internalize them, and then kill them. When they are in the bloodstream, mononuclear phagocytes are called
 monocytes
; when they migrate into tissue, they evolve into
 macrophages
. Macrophages often “process” an antigen and then present it to T lymphocytes.
 Neutrophils
 are the most abundant blood leukocytes. Large numbers are necessary because when neutrophils engulf and destroy foreign material, they also die.
 Eosinophils
 are specialized to act against large extracellular parasites.




The role of the
 auxiliary cells
 is to release mediators to produce inflammation.
 Mast cells
 lie close to blood vessels;
 basophils
 and
 platelets
 circulate in the blood. The main purpose of inflammation is to attract leukocytes and their resultant soluble mediators to a site of infection or injury.



Soluble Mediators


Soluble mediators are intervening agents dissolved in a solution. These substances are produced primarily, but not exclusively, by immune cells that act either directly on the target pathogen or indirectly by signaling other immune cells to act or release additional mediators. Each immune cell produces and secretes only one particular set of mediators, although more than one cell type may produce the same classification of mediator. Figure 22.1
 shows representative soluble mediators but there are many others.



Antibodies
 produced by B plasma cells are also known as
 immunoglobulins (Ig)
. Antibodies do not directly destroy antigens. Instead, they identify the invader by forming an antigen-antibody complex, and they then activate other soluble mediators and immune cells that perform the actual destruction.
 Cytokines
 are proteins or peptides that are released from immune cells and other tissues (notably skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which are now recognized as endocrine glands). Cytokines are involved in communication between immune cells (especially lymphocytes and phagocytes) and other cells of the body.
 
Table 22.1

 presents the major cytokines involved in the exercise immune response.

 Cytokines stimulate the proliferation of various immune cells and are important regulators of inflammation and the immune response. Among the principal types of cytokines are
 interferons
 (IFNs), which are important in limiting the spread of certain viral infections;
 interleukins (ILs)
, each of which acts on a specific group of immune cells to divide and differentiate; and
 tumor necrosis factors (TNFs)
, which are particularly important in inflammation and cytotoxic reactions. Cytokines are thought to be important in the exercise immune response because certain ones (IL-1, IL-6, IFNg, and TNFα) are proinflammatory factors that probably play a role in coordinating the responses to muscle damage that may result from strenuous exercise. Other cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-6 in a dual role) are anti-inflammatory and suppress the activity of inflammatory cells, allowing normal structure and function to be restored. The release of these anti-inflammatory cytokines follows the proinflammatory response to vigorous physical activity (

Moldoveanu et al., 2001

). It is also becoming clear that cytokines released from muscle (myokines) play a role in regulating metabolism (

Görgens et al., 2015

).

 Major Cytokines Involved in the Exercise Immune Response









Cytokines
 Proteins or peptides that are released from immune cells and other tissues (notably skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) and are involved in communication between immune cells (especially lymphocytes and phagocytes) and other cells of the body.





Complement
 is a group of serum proteins whose overall function is to control inflammation. Complement activation results in a series of reactions, including increased blood flow to the site and increased permeability of capillaries to plasma molecules, which ultimately leads to destruction of the stimulating antigen (

Mackinnon, 1999

; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016).




Acute phase proteins (APPs)
 are produced in and secreted from the liver, as are some complement proteins (

Mackinnon, 1992

; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016). APPs are stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines and are so named because they increase rapidly during an infection. For example, chronically elevated levels of C-reactive protein reflect systemic infection and are associated with increased risk of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. APPs stimulate an increase in the number of leukocytes and play an important role in tissue repair following muscle cell damage.




Inflammatory mediators
 are molecules that, as the name implies, control the development of inflammation. For example,
 histamine
,
 platelet-activating factor (PAF)
, and
 serotonin
 (

Figure 22.1

) all bring about increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. Other inflammatory mediators not released from basophils, mast cells, or platelets include
 fibrinopeptides
 (the substance removed from fibrinogen during blood coagulation) and
 fibrin breakdown products
 plus
 prostaglandins (PGE
2
)
. These substances make the actions of other inflammatory mediators more effective.



Processes


The immune system can destroy or inactivate a pathogen in numerous ways. The defense mechanism(s) employed in response to an immune challenge vary according to the type of pathogen and its life cycle stage. In cytotoxic
 reactions
, complete cells are killed, primarily by punching holes in their outer membranes. A target cell may be signaled to self-destruct, a process that is termed apoptosis. Lysis
 is a form of cytotoxic reaction in which a cell is killed by destruction of its cell membrane. Neutralization
 occurs when antibodies block the binding site on antigens so that they cannot bind to tissues and cause damage. Opsonization
 is the coating of the membrane of an antigen, making it easier for phagocytes to adhere to and engulf the antigen. Phagocytosis
 is the engulfing and digesting of a pathogen. Additionally, intracellular granules (small grain-like bodies) may be released in a respiratory oxidative burst
, which is a potent killer.


Functional Organization of the Immune System


As depicted in Figure 22.2
 functionally, the immune system can be divided into two separate but interrelated and overlapping branches: the innate (nonspecific) and the adaptive (specific) branches (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016; Smith, 1995
). Table 22.2
 provides a glossary of the cells, soluble mediators, and processes that play an important role in the immune response.









FIGURE 22.2

TABLE 22.2
 Glossary of Cells, Molecules, and Processes Involved in the Immune Response






The Innate Branch


The innate branch
 protects against foreign substances or cells without having to recognize them. It is nonselective and provides an initial line of defense against microbial invasion. The innate system consists of both a cellular component and physical barriers. Intact skin and mucous membranes are the major physical barriers. The primary cells of the innate system are the NK lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. Complement and acute phase proteins are the major soluble mediators. The innate system works through the processes of lysis, opsonization, and phagocytosis
.


Inflammation


Central to the functioning of the innate branch of the immune system is the inflammatory response
 (Figure 22.3
). The cells of the immune system are widely dispersed in the body. When a thermal or physical injury or an infection occurs, immune cells must concentrate at the site of the emergency. Muscle or tissue damage following strenuous exercise can be a potent signal for inflammation. As shown in Figure 22.3
, immune cells converge through four processes:









FIGURE 22.3
 Sequence of Events in Inflammation.
 Inflammation is characterized by heat, redness, pain, and swelling. These familiar responses occur because of the action of inflammatory mediators. Inflammation ensures immune cells are concentrated at the site of injury and that metabolic activity is increased to facilitate healing.





1.
 Vasodilation and an increased blood supply to the area




2.
 Increased capillary permeability




3.
 Chemotaxis




4.
 Leukocytosis (an increased number of leukocytes)




Increased blood flow and increased capillary permeability help bring leukocytes to the site of tissue damage or infection.
 Chemotaxis
 is the increased directional migration of immune cells.
 
Figure 22.4

 depicts the sequence of events by which muscular damage can initiate chemotaxis and set the stage for repair of the damaged tissue. Chemotaxis occurs in response to the release of chemotactic factors, inflammatory mediators, and acute phase proteins. Neutrophils are the first cells to arrive at the injury site and do so within an hour. Neutrophils are followed by monocytes, which become macrophages once they enter the tissue. Macrophages dominate at the site of the injury 5–6 hours after the inflammatory response begins. On their arrival, these phagocytes adhere to

 the walls of the capillaries, a process facilitated by cell adhesion molecules (CAM). Eventually, the phagocytes push between the endothelial cells in the capillary and cross the membrane. They then squeeze through the cell membrane by a process called diapedesis and move to the actual site of the inflammation. Once there, both neutrophils and macrophages phagocytize the foreign antigens and/or cellular debris.










FIGURE 22.4
 Events by Which Tissue Damage Leads to Increased Leukocytes in Tissues.
 Muscle damage (1) produces a chemical signal that attracts neutrophils and monocytes to the area (2). The immune cells then adhere to the capillary wall (3) and move into the tissue area through the process of diapedesis (4).





Inflammation is characterized by redness, heat, swelling, and pain. The increased blood flow to the area resulting from vasodilation leads to the redness and heat. The increased capillary permeability allows fluid to seep into extracellular spaces, creating swelling that activates pain receptors. The pain and swelling can result in lack of mobility. Although immobility may be inconvenient, it forces the injured part to rest, which aids in healing. Thus, inflammation can destroy foreign pathogens, prevent the spread of damaging agents, dispose of cellular debris due to tissue damage, and set the stage for tissue repair. Although part of the innate system, inflammation is also an important component of the adaptive immune response.

The Adaptive Branch


In contrast to the innate branch, in the adaptive branch
 of the immune system, immune cells recognize a foreign material and react specifically and selectively to destroy it. The adaptive branch is antigen specific, is systemic, and has memory. The adaptive branch includes humoral (from the Latin word humor, meaning “fluids”) and cell-mediated immunity. Antibodies produced from B cells provide
 humoral immunity
. The antibodies circulate in the blood and lymph, where they bind to bacteria, toxins, and free viruses; inactivate them temporarily; and mark them for destruction by phagocytes or complements. Cell-mediated immunity
 is provided by T lymphocytes that directly attack and lyse cells infected by viruses, parasites, cancer cells, or grafts; release chemical mediators to enhance inflammation; and activate lymphocytes and macrophages.



The body’s ability to mount a specialized immune response involves specific proteins called
 major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
 that exist on the membranes of the body’s own cells and pathogens. MHCs are different in each individual except in identical twins. With an organ transplant, therefore, the recipient’s immune system must be suppressed because otherwise it would not recognize the donor MHC and would “attack” the transplanted cells, resulting in the “rejection” of the organ. As can be seen in
 
Figure 22.2

, the major cells of the adaptive branch are the B and T cells. The major soluble mediators are antibodies, cytokines, and complement. The processes of action include lysis, neutralization, opsonization, and, indirectly, phagocytosis.
 
Figure 22.5

 shows how the innate and adaptive branches work together for a generalized immune response, emphasizing the role of macrophages in phagocytizing the foreign invader and activating the adaptive immune response by serving as antigen-presenting cells.










FIGURE 22.5
 Central Role of Macrophages in the Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses.
 Macrophages are phagocytes that ingest foreign agents as part of the innate immune response. Once a macrophage has ingested a foreign invader, it activates the adaptive branch of the immune system by “presenting” portions of the foreign invader to adaptive cells.





The body’s many defenses against tissue injury and infection are amazing and, admittedly, can seem overwhelming. Remember that the functions of different structures and substances in the immune system overlap and are in some ways redundant. This ensures an effective immune response to most pathogens and is essential for health.





The Immune Response to Exercise




An acute bout of exercise causes an immune response. Exercise physiologists, other exercise professionals, clinicians, and the general public are interested in the
 relationship between exercise and immune function. Indeed, much research has focused on this issue, although much about this relationship remains unanswered. Figure 22.6
 depicts the complexities involved in trying to address this important question (Woods et al., 1999
). As with the effect of exercise on other body systems, the immune response to exercise depends largely on the intensity and duration of the exercise. Furthermore, because the physiological stress of exercise is additive with other stresses in one’s life, including psychological, environmental, and nutritional stress, these factors must also be considered (Steinacker et al., 2004
; Walsh and Whitham, 2006
; Walsh and Oliver, 2016
). Further complicating the relationship between exercise and immune function is a vast array of immune functions. Exercise appears to affect all of the cells of the immune system, but in different ways. Furthermore, each immune cell may perform several functions, and exercise may affect these functions differently.









FIGURE 22.6
 Relationships among Exercise, Immune Function, and Health.
 Exercise is one of many factors that activate the immune system and it does so through multiple mechanisms. There are multiple immune responses to exercise, and they may have a positive or negative impact on health.





Researchers investigating the effects of exercise on immune function typically have subjects engage in an acute bout of exercise in a laboratory setting. They may then report resulting changes in blood levels of an immune cell, tissue levels of an immune cell, or functioning of an immune cell. Such studies may compare the acute response of the immune system in individuals with different characteristics (age, fitness status, etc.).




Although it is interesting to know how exercise affects individual cells of the immune system, most people are concerned about how exercise relates to health outcomes, such as the rate and severity of an infection or the risk of developing cancer. To answer these questions, researchers typically use an epidemiological approach that relies on subjects reporting incidence of illness. Many of the original studies investigating the relationship between exercise and infection rates were epidemiological studies that quantified training level (as a measure of exercise stress) and collected self-reported data on incidence of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (

Nieman et al., 1990

;
 
Peters and Bateman, 1983

). Generally, these studies found that individuals who ran marathons or competed in endurance events had a higher incidence of URTI (

Nieman, 1997a

,

b

). More recent studies have also reported that higher training volume increases the risk of upper respiratory tract infection (Gleeson et al., 2011;
 
Gleeson et al., 2013

). However, these finding are not uniform, and in fact, other studies found opposite results. It has been reported that men and women with high levels of physical activity (~1-hour exercise per day) have a reduced incidence of URTI (Fondell et al., 2011; Landers-Ramos et al., 2014) and that international-level athletes have a lower incidence of URTI than national-level athletes (

Walsh and Oliver, 2016

). Thus, while it is often reported that highly trained athletes have a greater incidence of URTI, more research is still needed.




Studies reporting incidence of URTI must be interpreted cautiously because they are based on self-reports and because the symptoms of a URTI, such as a sore throat, may be caused by something other than an infection (e.g., airway inflammation due to drying of the mucosal membrane or inhalation of dry air or pollutants) (

Gleeson, 2007

;
 
Gleeson and Pyne, 2016

). Further complicating an understanding of the effect of exercise on upper respiratory tract infections is the fact that these, because they rely on self-reports, do not provide actual evidence of an infection. This has prompted leading experts in the field to recommend that the phrase upper respiratory symptoms be used in studies that lack physician diagnosed infection or the lack of pathogen identification (

Walsh et al., 2011a

,
 
b

). The precise relationship between exercise and the immune system will be better understood with controlled prospective studies that investigate immune function and health outcomes simultaneously

.




A final challenge to understanding the relationship between exercise and immune function is the number of possible mechanisms that may mediate the effect of exercise on the immune system. Exercise may alter immune function directly or through any combination of the mechanisms listed below (

Fleshner, 2005

; Pedersen and Ullum, 1994;
 
Steinacker et al., 2004

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

):




1.
 Directly stimulating immune function




2.
 Stimulating the sympathetic nervous system




3.
 Altering hormones (especially epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroxine)




4.
 Increasing body temperature




5.
 Exercise-induced cell damage (and the release of acute phase proteins or heat shock proteins)




6.
 Increasing oxidative stress




Another important factor that must be considered when describing the effect of exercise on the immune system is the recovery period from exercise. A strenuous bout of exercise alters immune function for several hours or days. In fact, the suppression of several immune cells in the postexercise period is often proposed as the cause for the greater prevalence in upper respiratory tract infections frequently found among high-volume, endurance-trained athletes (

Gleeson and Pyne, 2016

;
 
Mackinnon et al., 1987

;
 
Nieman, 1997b

;
 
Tomasi et al., 1982

).




Clearly, the type of exercise is also a primary factor in determining the exercise response of the immune system. Most research on the effects of exercise on the immune system has studied prolonged aerobic exercise because of the epidemiological data linking high-volume endurance training with a greater incidence of upper respiratory tract infection. Thus, the following sections deviate somewhat from the exercise categories used throughout this textbook being limited to two variations of long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise and very short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise.

 Specifically, the immune response is detailed in relation to “medium-duration” (45 minutes), moderate- and high-intensity aerobic exercise; “prolonged” (1–3 hours), moderate- and high-intensity exercise; and intense interval exercise.



Medium-Duration (<45 Minutes), Moderate- to High-Intensity Aerobic Exercise



Table 22.3
 reports the percentage changes in immune cell numbers during or immediately after exercise and during recovery from medium-duration, moderate- and high-intensity exercise (Mackinnon, 1999
). Exercise results in leukocytosis
, an increased number of white blood cells. Leukocytosis is evident during most forms of physical activity and depends on the intensity and duration of the exercise. In most cases, the leukocytosis persists for at least 1–4 hours after exercise.

 Exercise Response of Immune Cell Number to Medium-Duration (45 min), Moderate- and High-Intensity Aerobic Exercise

Leukocytosis
 An increase in circulating leukocytes (WBC).





Neutrophils increase in number as a result of endurance exercise. The increases are greater after high-intensity exercise than moderate exercise. The increase in neutrophils is evident for 2–4 hours after exercise and is likely evident during moderate exercise, although research data are lacking. It appears that medium-duration aerobic exercise also enhances neutrophil function. Both the phagocytic activity and the oxidative burst activity of neutrophils are reportedly enhanced (

Woods et al., 1999

).




Circulating levels of monocytes are not altered by medium-duration moderate exercise but increase modestly during high-intensity exercise. This elevation persists for at least 2 hours after exercise. Recall that when monocytes leave the bloodstream, they are transformed to macrophages, which perform several roles in the immune response. Research suggests that macrophage functions are enhanced following medium-duration exercise. These functions include phagocytic activity, oxidative burst activity, and antitumor activity (

Nieman, 1997a

;
 
Woods and Davis, 1994

;
 
Woods et al., 1993

,
 
1997

,
 
1999

).




Circulating levels of natural killer (NK) cells increase during medium-duration bouts of both moderate- and

 high-intensity exercise, with the more intense exercise causing a larger increase in NK cell numbers. Of greater importance, however, are the different responses during recovery. Following moderate-intensity exercise, blood levels of NK cells return to normal within 1 hour. Following high-intensity exercise, in contrast, NK cell levels drop approximately 40% below normal levels and remain depressed for 2–4 hours. Natural killer cell activity (NKCA) mimics the changes in NK cell numbers (

Mackinnon, 1999

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

).
 
Figure 22.7

 depicts the changes in NKCA after 45 minutes of intense (80%
 

), 2.5–3 hours of running (~76%
 

), and during recovery. For now, concentrate on the 45-minute bout of exercise. Notice the large increase in NKCA immediately after exercise, followed by a reduction in NKCA below pre-exercise levels and a subsequent return to pre-exercise values by the 4th hour (

Nieman et al., 1990

,
 
1995a

,

b

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

).










FIGURE 22.7
 Natural Killer Cell Activity (NKCA) during and following Exercise of Different Durations.
 NKCA is greater after 45 minutes of running (~80% 

) than after 2.5–3 hours of running (~76% 

). However, NKCA is suppressed longer after prolonged running (2.5–3 hours) than after 45 minutes of running. Sources

T-cell numbers do not change during moderate-intensity, medium-duration exercise but increase markedly as a result of high-intensity exercise. During recovery from intense exercise, a suppression in T-cell numbers is evident for 1–2 hours of recovery. As with NK cells, this suppression in T cells after exercise may make one more susceptible to infection.




B-cell numbers do not appear to change immediately after medium-duration bouts of moderate- or high-intensity dynamic exercise. However, B-cell numbers decrease 1–2 hours following intense exercise. Daughter cells of the B cells, plasma cells, produce antibodies (immunoglobulins) that lead to destruction of antigens. Serum or salivary levels of immunoglobulins apparently do not change following aerobic exercise lasting less than 45 minutes (

Mackinnon, 1999

).



Prolonged (1–3 Hours) Moderate- to High-Intensity Aerobic Exercise



Table 22.4
 reports the changes in immune cell numbers during or immediately after exercise and during recovery from prolonged moderate- and high-intensity aerobic exercise (Mackinnon, 1999
). Prolonged high-intensity
 exercise results in the greatest leukocytosis immediately after exercise and in recovery (Da Silva Neves et al., 2015
).

 Exercise Response of Immune Cell Number to Prolonged (1–3 hr) Moderate- and High-Intensity Aerobic Exercise

Neutrophils increase in number as a result of aerobic exercise. The increases are greater following high-intensity exercise. Prolonged high-intensity exercise causes a significantly greater increase in neutrophils than shorter exercise bouts of the same intensity. Large increases in neutrophil numbers are evident for 2–6 hours after high-intensity exercise. Despite the increase in neutrophil numbers after prolonged moderate- and high-intensity exercise, there is evidence that neutrophil function may not respond uniformly (

Mackinnon, 1999

). Prolonged moderate-exercise is associated with enhanced neutrophil function (phagocytic activity, oxidative burst activity, and antimicrobial activity). In contrast, prolonged high-intensity exercise is associated with a suppression of neutrophil function (

Nieman, 1997a

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

).




Circulating levels of monocytes are not altered by moderate-intensity aerobic exercise but increase substantially during intense aerobic exercise. The elevation persists for at least 2 hours after exercise. Furthermore, the increase in monocytes after prolonged high-intensity exercise is considerably greater than the increase in monocytes after medium-duration, high-intensity exercise, as is the postexercise elevation. Research suggests that macrophage function is enhanced following prolonged moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. However, the effect of high-intensity exercise on macrophage function is unclear. Some functions appear enhanced (phagocytosis, lysing, and antiviral activity), whereas other activities (oxidative burst) may be suppressed (

Kohut et al., 1998

;
 
Nieman, 1997a

;
 
Woods et al., 1997

,
 
1999

).




Circulating levels of NK cells increase considerably following prolonged bouts of both moderate- and high-intensity aerobic exercise, with the intense exercise causing a larger increase in NK cell numbers. After prolonged moderate- or high-intensity exercise, NK cell numbers are reduced, more so after high-intensity exercise. As with medium-duration exercise, NKCA mimics the changes in NK cell numbers. Look again at
 
Figure 22.7

, this time paying attention to the change in NKCA after 2.5–3 hours of intense (76%
 

) running and during recovery (

Nieman et al., 1990

,
 
1995a

,

b

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

). Notice the smaller increase in NKCA immediately postexercise for the prolonged run (2.5–3 hours) compared to the shorter run (45 minutes). However, during recovery from the prolonged run, NKCA is severe and persistently reduced below pre-exercise levels. NKCA remained suppressed in excess of 20 hours following the prolonged, high-intensity run.




T-cell numbers increase after prolonged moderate-intensity and high-intensity exercise. During recovery from prolonged exercise (both moderate and high intensity), T-cell numbers are suppressed.




B-cell numbers do not appear to change immediately after prolonged bouts of moderate- or high-intensity exercise or during recovery from exercise. However, salivary levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) are depressed after prolonged high-intensity exercise (

Mackinnon, 1999

;
 
Novas et al., 2003

;
 
Tomasi et al., 1982

), and it has been widely speculated that reduced salivary IgA levels are associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections during heavy training (

Walsh et al., 2011a

,
 
b

). The depression that is seen in cell number and function is transient with values typically returning to baseline values within 24 hours. However, inadequate recovery periods may not allow for fully immune recovery and may play a role in overtraining syndrome (see discussion later in this chapter).



Intense Interval Exercise



Table 22.5
 reports the changes in immune cell numbers during or immediately after exercise and during recovery from intense interval exercise (Mackinnon, 1999
). Again, exercise results in leukocytosis for at least 2–6 hours after exercise.

Neutrophils increase in number as a result of intense interval exercise and remain elevated for 2–6 hours afterward. Similarly, the circulating levels of monocytes increase following intense interval exercise and remain elevated for 2–6 hours. NK cell numbers increase markedly following intense interval exercise but return to pre-exercise levels within 2 hours.




T-cell numbers increase following intense interval exercise. During recovery, T-cell numbers are suppressed for 1–2 hours. B-cell numbers increase immediately after intense interval exercise but return to normal levels within 1–6 hours.



Cytokine Response to Exercise


Exercise is a potent activator of the immune system leading to changes in many cytokine concentrations. Many of the cytokines are released from adipose tissue (adipokines) and muscle tissue (myokines). Figure 22.8
 is a schematic graph of the relative magnitude of changes in plasma cytokines during and after strenuous exercise. The most notable and
 best-characterized cytokine response to strenuous exercise is a large, rapid increase in IL-6. Plasma IL-6 concentrations increase exponentially, up to 100-fold, as exercise continues. This increase is related to exercise intensity, duration, muscle mass, and the individual’s aerobic capacity (Gokhale et al., 2007
; Miles, 2005
; Raschke and Eckel, 2013; Steinacker and Lormes, 2004
). Importantly, the increase in IL-6 does not require muscle damage, suggesting that cytokines likely play important regulatory roles in addition to mediating inflammation. Plasma levels of IL-6 typically return to baseline levels within a few hours after exercise if muscle damage has not occurred (Miles, 2005
; Raschke and Eckel, 2013
). Following the increase in IL-6, the concentration in other cytokines begins to increase. IL-1ra and IL-10 increase after IL-6, suggesting that IL-6 plays an important role in regulating the release of these anti-inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, the proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-1β, which increase during infection, do not increase after exercise in the absence of muscle damage (Petersen and Pedersen, 2005
). Taken together, these data suggest that while exercise may evoke both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, the anti-inflammatory cytokine response predominates. It has been reported that physically active individuals have less systemic inflammation than their sedentary counterparts and cytokines are a potential mechanism for this observation (Hayashino et al., 2014
).

Skeletal Muscle as an Endocrine Tissue that Releases Regulatory Cytokines (Myokines)


An acute bout of exercise is known to have a profound effect on the immune system. As discussed earlier, much recent research has focused on the effect of exercise on cytokines and their role in regulating the immune response. Cytokines are released from contracting muscle as well as from immune cells (Pedersen et al., 2007
; Steensberg et al., 2000
). This discovery has important implications because it provides a mechanistic link between muscle contraction and the regulation of the immune response to exercise. Furthermore, cytokines released from exercising skeletal muscles also play an important role in metabolism. Cytokines released from muscle tissue are termed myokines—parallel to the use of the term “adipokines” for cytokines released specifically from adipose tissue. Importantly, several cytokines are released from both adipose tissue and muscle tissue leading to the suggestion that they be termed adipomyokines (Görgens et al., 2015
; Raschke and Eckel, 2013
).



Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the most abundant myokine released by muscle tissue. IL-6 is usually identified as a proinflammatory cytokine; however, it also plays an anti-inflammatory role (

Petersen and Pedersen, 2005

). During contraction, skeletal muscle fibers produce and release large amounts of IL-6 (up to a 100-fold increase). In fact, skeletal muscle production of IL-6 can account entirely for the exercise-induced increase in IL-6 (

Steensberg et al., 2000

).
 
Figure 22.9

 is a schematic of how IL-6 may function

 as a myokine. IL-6 released from exercising skeletal muscle exerts its immunoregulatory role by its anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory actions. Anti-inflammatory effects include an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1ra, IL-10) and suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα. IL-6 also exerts a neuroendocrine influence by stimulating the hypothalamus and leading to the subsequent release of GH (from the anterior pituitary) and epinephrine and cortisol (from the adrenal glands). IL-6 also plays a metabolic role by increasing lipolysis and fat oxidation and increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Thus, IL-6 appears to play a central role in regulating a coordinated response to exercise that facilitates both the hormonal and immune responses necessary to balance inflammation and provide for the metabolic needs of working muscle (

Pedersen et al., 2007

).

While extensive research efforts have provided information about plasma levels of the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (see
 
Figure 22.8

) after strenuous exercise, these data must be interpreted cautiously. Cytokines have different rates of production and clearance, and their localization and use are important for assessing their contribution to overall immune function (Mastro and Bonneau, 2005). It is therefore fair to say that while cytokines play an important role in neurohormonal regulation, hormonal regulation, and immune response to exercise, many questions still remain regarding the precise role of individual cytokines.




In summary, an acute bout of exercise has profound effects on many immune variables, including cell number and function and circulating levels of cytokines. In general, moderate exercise appears to cause transient increases in immune function, with immune cell number and function returning to baseline within a couple of hours. Strenuous exercise, however, causes greater disruption of the immune system and a decrease in some cells and cellular function (especially NK cells and T cells) that may last for many hours into recovery. This reduction in cell number and function is a theoretical link to the often reported higher incidence of upper respiratory tract infections reported in high-volume, endurance-trained individuals.



Neuroendocrine Control of Immune Response to Exercise


As discussed in the previous chapter, exercise is a stressor that stimulates both neuroendocrine and immune responses. Figure 22.10
 builds on Figure 21.2
 and extends the basic stress response to depict the neuroendocrine influence on immune function. This figure emphasizes that the body’s response to exercise stress is a system-wide effort that is largely coordinated by the integration of the immune system with the neuroendocrine system (Fragala et al., 2011
). Much of the influence on the immune system depends on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which results in the release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex, and the sympathetic-adrenal medulla axis, which results in the release of the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla. Sympathetic nerve stimulation also directly innervates lymphoid organs. Exercise also causes the release of cytokines from skeletal muscle and immune cells, which help regulate the immune response.









FIGURE 22.10
 Neuroendocrine Regulation of Immune Function.
 The immune response to exercise is mediated largely through the nervous and endocrine systems.





As stated previously, moderate aerobic exercise appears to enhance immune function, and the cells of the immune system return to resting levels soon after exercise. Severe, exhaustive aerobic exercise, in contrast, causes an enhanced immune function followed by a suppression of cell activity. These different responses appear to depend largely on the hormones epinephrine and cortisol. During exercise at greater than 60%
 

,

 epinephrine and cortisol levels in the blood begin to increase rapidly, reaching their highest level after maximal exercise. Epinephrine is associated with a substantial increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood. Cortisol causes an increased number of neutrophils but a decreased number of lymphocytes. Immediately after exercise, the blood concentrations of epinephrine fall rapidly to pre-exercise levels, whereas cortisol levels remain elevated for 2 hours or more (see
 
Chapter 21

). Researchers therefore hypothesize that after intense exercise, epinephrine is responsible for the increase in circulating lymphocytes, and the longer-acting cortisol is responsible for the prolonged increase in neutrophils and the decrease in lymphocytes (

Nieman, 1994

).





Training Adaptation and Maladaptation




The relationship of training to athletic performance involves a continuum that is often depicted as an inverted U (Figure 1.10
) (Fry et al., 1991
; Kuipers, 1998
; Rowbottom et al., 1998
). As described in Chapter 1
, the goal of optimal periodized training is the attainment of peak fitness and/or performance. However, with too great or improperly applied training overload, maladaptation is possible.




Table 22.6

 summarizes training adaptations in the immune system of moderately trained and highly trained or overtrained individuals. The resting immune system of moderately trained aerobic athletes is usually within normal parameters, although neutrophil function and serum immunoglobulins may be relatively low (

Mackinnon, 2000

;
 
Nieman, 1994

;
 
Shephard et al., 1995

). In general, moderate training appears to enhance some functions of the immune system, especially natural killer cell count and activity (

Mackinnon, 2000

;
 
Matthews et al., 2002

;
 
Shephard et al., 1995

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

). In contrast, strenuous training or overtraining is associated with a suppression of several immune variables. Most notable among changed immune functions following severe training is a suppression of leukocyte numbers, a decrease in neutrophil function, a decrease in natural killer cell activity, and a reduction in lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, and NK cells) (

Mackinnon, 1999

,
 
2000

;
 
Nieman, 1997a

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

). As seen in
 
Table 22.6

, training-induced adaptations also occur in several cytokines, acute phase proteins, and antibodies (immunoglobulins). Intense training or overtraining is associated with a reduction in acute phase proteins, serum Ig, salivary IgA, and complement (

Mackinnon, 1999

;
 
Nieman, 1997a

;
 
Papacosta and Nassis, 2011

;
 
Woods et al., 1999

).

One of the greatest research challenges in this area is to define more clearly what constitutes “moderate” training and “strenuous” training. Furthermore, there is a need to understand more fully whether strenuous training in itself results in immune suppression or whether immune suppression occurs only with more severe overtraining. Studies have documented decreases in some markers of immunity of 15–25% following heavy training programs, but whether or not that has functional consequences for health or illness remains unknown (

Walsh and Oliver, 2016

). While many

 chapters in this text focus on the beneficial adaptations that result from exercise training, the following sections address the serious condition of maladaptation.




The first step toward maladaptation may be
 overreaching (OR)
, a short-term decrement in performance capacity that generally lasts only a few days to 2 weeks and from which the individual easily recovers. Overreaching can result from planned shock microcycles (see
 
Chapter 1

) or inadvertently from too much stress and too little planned recovery (

Carfagno and Hendrix, 2014

;
 
Fry and Kraemer, 1997

;
 
Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Kuipers, 1998

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2013

). If overreaching is planned and recovery is sufficient, positive adaptation and improved performance, sometimes called supercompensation, result (

Figure 22.11A

). This type of overreaching is called
 functional overreaching (FOR)
. However, if recovery is insufficient and takes longer than desired,
 nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR)
 is said to occur. If NFOR is left unchecked or the individual or coach interprets the decrement in performance as an indication that more work must be done with less rest and recovery, NFOR may develop into overtraining (

Figure 22.11B

). Overtraining, more properly called the
 overtraining syndrome (OTS)
 (or staleness), is a state of chronic decrement in performance and ability to train, in which restoration may take several months, or even years. Indeed, the distinction between NFOR and OTS is based primarily on the amount of time needed for performance restoration (approximately several weeks to months for NFOR and several months to years with OTS). This is assuming that all other possible causes of prolonged underperformance have been eliminated (

Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)
 A state of chronic decrement in performance and ability to train in which restoration may take several weeks, months, or even years.





The relationship between overreaching and the overtraining syndrome is often depicted as a continuum, as shown in
 
Figure 1.10

 (

Carfagno and Hendrix, 2014

;
 
Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2010

,
 
2013

). As the imbalance between training and recovery increases, the complexity of the symptoms also increases, and the athlete progresses from overreached to overtrained. It is thought that the symptoms of OTS are more severe than those of NFOR. No experimental data exist, however,

 to either confirm or refute this assumption (

Halson and Jeukendrup, 2004

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2010

,
 
2013

). Coaches and athletes often use shock microcycles to induce overreaching in the normal periodization of training, making it possible for scientists to follow and test athletes in such a situation. However, it is neither ethical nor reasonable to deliberately induce a state of OTS. Scientific data on OTS have therefore largely been derived retroactively from case studies of athletes with unexplained underperformance.




Data on meaningful numbers of subjects in both resistance and endurance activities followed from adaptation and performance improvement through overreaching to the overtraining syndrome are not available. Nonetheless, what has become clear is that excessively high training volumes or intensities in resistance exercise presents different physiological and performance profiles when compared to overreaching or overtraining in endurance exercise. When excessive volumes of maximal resistance loads are used for training, maximal muscle strength is one of the last performance variables to be adversely affected. Conversely, high speed/sprint and power activities are the first types of performance to decrease with excessive resistance training (

Meeusen et al., 2013

).




A very long list of signs and symptoms (over 125) has been observed in athletes exhibiting unexplained performance decrements (

Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Urhausen and Kindermann, 2002

).
 
Table 22.7

 lists some, but not all, signs and symptoms that may be observed by athletes, coaches, and athletic trainers. This list is complicated by the fact that apparently there are two forms of the OTS: a sympathetic form and a parasympathetic form (

Flynn, 1998

;
 
Fry and Kraemer, 1997

;
 
Kenttä and Hassmén, 1998

;
 
Lehmann et al., 1993

,
 
1998a

,

b

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2013

;
 
Urhausen and Kindermann, 2000

;
 
Witlert, 2000

). The sympathetic form is characterized by an increased sympathetic neural tone at rest and during exercise and down-regulation of beta (β) receptors. Restlessness and hyperexcitability dominate. For example, an elevated resting heart rate, slower heart rate recovery after exercise, decreased appetite and unintentional loss of body mass, excessive sweating, and disturbed sleep patterns are symptoms of the sympathetic form of overtraining (

Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Lehmann et al., 1998b

). The sympathetic form of overtraining is generally considered an early indication of overtraining. It appears to be most closely related to high-intensity anaerobic activities including excessive resistance exercise loads (

Fry and Kraemer, 1997

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2013

). The parasympathetic form of overtraining is characterized by sympathetic neural insufficiency, a decreased sensitivity to the pituitary and adrenal hormones, and increased parasympathetic tone at rest and during exercise. The symptoms of the parasympathetic form of overtraining are less obvious and in isolation may be difficult to distinguish from positive training adaptations (

Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Lehmann et al., 1998b

). For example, resting pulse rates may be lower, submaximal exercise heart rates and lactate responses lower, and heart rate recovery from exercise rapid, but these responses are typically associated with early fatigue and impaired maximal work capacity markers, such as heart rate and lactate. Apathy, digestive disturbances, and altered immune and reproductive function are common. The parasympathetic form of the overtraining syndrome is the more advanced form. Individual differences in the nervous system may predispose any given individual to either up-regulation (sympathetic form) or down- regulation (parasympathetic form) of the neuroendocrine homeostasis.




TABLE 22.7
 Signs and Symptoms of the Overtraining Syndrome







The signs and symptoms of OTS are outward manifestations of neuroendocrine imbalances, immune system activation and/or suppression, or a reversal of normal physiological adaptations. They provide a starting point for research investigating the physiological mechanisms behind OTS

.



Hypothesized Causes and Mechanisms of Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)


The precise cause(s) and mechanism(s) of OTS are unknown. A high-volume training load performed at high intensity, applied in a monotonous manner, and without sufficient rest and recovery that alters metabolic processes and leads to an accumulation of muscle trauma appears to be the primary predisposing factor (Figure 22.12
) (Armstrong and vanHeest, 2002
; Budgett, 1998
; Fry et al., 1991
; Meeusen et al., 2013
; Petibois et al., 2002
, 2003
; Smith, 2000
). Related stressors such as frequent competition, excessive travel, training and competing under inhospitable environmental conditions, and/or poor nutrition as well as unrelated stressors such as family, school, or work commitments accumulate and are likely peripheral causes. Thus, OTS may represent the sum of multiple life stressors and can be understood, at least partially with the context of Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome (see Chapter 1
) (Meeusen et al., 2013
).









FIGURE 22.12
 Hypothesized Mechanism of Overtraining Syndrome.
 A high-volume training load performed at high intensity, applied in a monotonous manner, and without sufficient rest and recovery that alters metabolic processes and leads to an accumulation of muscle trauma appears to be the primary predisposing factor to the development of the overtraining syndrome. Alterations of carbohydrate (CHO), lipid (FAT), and/or protein (PRO) metabolism (represented on the left side of this flow chart) and microtrauma or tissue injury in muscles (presented on the right side of the flow chart) can individually or collectively impact both the central nervous system and the immune system. Full details describing this figure are included in the text. Sources

 Budgett (1998); Chrousos and Gold (1992); Fry et al. (1992); Gastmann and Lehmann (1998); Keizer (1998); Kreider et al. (1998); Moldoveanu et al. (2001); Petibois et al. (2003); Robson (2003); Smith (2000, 2003a,b); Steinacker et al. (2004); Snyder (1998).





Several hypotheses have been developed to explain the physiological mechanisms by which probable causative factors actually bring about OTS. Remember that a hypothesis by definition is “an assumption not proved by experiment or observation. It is assumed for the sake of testing its soundness or to facilitate investigation of a class of phenomena” (

Thomas, 1985

). Thus, while research data can account for some observed symptoms of OTS, these data are generally insufficient to justify calling any hypothesis a theory (a well-substantiated explanation that has been repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation). In short, the underlying mechanism(s) remain(s) unproven at this time (

Armstrong and vanHeest, 2002

;
 
Carfagno and Hendrix, 2014

).




These hypotheses may be categorized in three major areas: biochemical/metabolic, neuroendocrine, and immunological.
 
Figure 22.12

 indicates how these areas may interact in producing OTS. Refer to this figure throughout the following discussion.



Alterations of Carbohydrate, Lipid, and Protein Metabolism


Muscles obviously use fuel for contractions in exercise training. Indeed, a major objective of exercise training, especially endurance training, is to increase metabolism to support competition. OTS in endurance athletes thus may be mediated primarily through dysfunctions of carbohydrate (CHO), lipid (FAT), and/or protein (PRO) metabolism (Kreider et al., 1998
; Petibois et al., 2002
, 2003
; Snyder, 1998
). Glycogen depletion may become a reality with insufficient CHO ingestion after successive training bouts. Low glycogen can in itself lead to the defining signs of OTS, early fatigue, and poor performance (Snyder, 1998
).
 Glycogen, of course, is the primary fuel for anaerobic metabolism. One of the most consistent findings in both endurance and strength athletes exhibiting OTS is a diminished maximal lactate concentration despite submaximal values remaining unchanged or being slightly reduced (Urhausen and Kindermann, 2002
). Chronic energy deficiency (primarily glycogen depletion) amplifies the stress hormone and cytokine responses to exercise and may well be one of the “triggering” factors that can lead to the OTS (Meeusen et al., 2013
).



The predominant backup fuel to CHO for exercise is, of course, FAT in the form of triglyceride-derived free fatty acids (FFA). While the utilization of higher amounts of FFA and the sparing of glycogen is a beneficial adaptation of training, this typically occurs in the presence of adequate glycogen stores. Without sufficient CHO stores and in the presence of the oxidative stress that accompanies endurance activity, alterations occur in the triglyceride/fatty acid cycle, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increase. These changes have been linked to the pathogenesis of inflammation and immunosuppression (

Petibois et al., 2002

,
 
2003

;
 
Steinacker et al., 2004

). Additionally, leptin is released from adipose cells. Leptin provides feedback for satiety, may act as a metabolic hormone, and helps regulate hypothalamic-pituitary function. Movement of fatty acid from adipocytes may inhibit leptin secretion. Low plasma leptin levels activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) as well as sympathetic activity, and as a cytokine, leptin is closely linked to immune function (

Saris, 2001

;
 
Steinacker et al., 2004

).




These alterations in CHO (insufficient) and FAT metabolism (increased FFA utilization) also lead to shifts in PRO metabolism. Protein is not normally utilized extensively as fuel. However, under conditions of high-intensity, long-duration training or competition, especially when CHO stores are inadequate, PRO (particularly the branched chain amino acids [BCAA]) is utilized as fuel. Furthermore, the increased circulating FFA, which must be transported in blood by albumin, leads to release of another amino acid (AA), tryptophan (TRY). TRY also normally binds to albumin. In addition to competing for albumin, BCAA and TRY normally compete for the same carrier to enter the brain. The decreased BCAAs (when utilized to supply fuel) and increased TRY favor the entry of TRY into the brain. In the brain, TRY is converted into serotonin. Increased levels of serotonin are responsible for decreased motor excitability, decreased appetite, increased sleep, and altered neuroendocrine function—among the signs and symptoms often seen in OTS (

Budgett, 1998

;
 
Gastmann and Lehmann, 1998

;
 
Kreider et al., 1998

).




Glutamine is the most abundant AA in human muscle and plasma. Glutamine is an energy source essential for kidney function; used by the liver during exercise for the production and release of the antioxidant glutathione; important at the neural level in the perception of exertion, lethargy, and energy levels; and a precursor of substances essential for immune cell replication. Specifically, macrophages cannot synthesize certain cytokines (such as interleukin-1 [IL-1]) if glutamine is in short supply. Cytokines are essential for communication between immune cells and other body cells. Muscles are the main source of glutamine. Psychological, environmental, and exercise stresses, especially with insufficient rest periods between bouts, may decrease glutamine flux from muscle during recovery. Immune function may consequently be depressed after exercise due to the decreased availability of glutamine. This in turn may be linked to a high incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) commonly reported in athletes after exhaustive exercise (such as a marathon) or in an overreached/overtrained state (

Budgett, 1998

;
 
Fry et al., 1991

;
 
Gotovtseva et al., 1998

;
 
Papacosta and Nassis, 2011

;
 
Petibois et al., 2002

,
 
2003

; Robson, 2003;
 
Rowbottom et al., 1996

). Note that only cell-mediated immunity seems adversely affected (

Figure 22.12

).




Altered neuroendocrine function is predominantly mediated through the hypothalamus in Selye’s classic stress response (Selye, 1956). The primary neural component is the brainstem (locus ceruleus)-sympathetic nervous system pathway. The primarily hormonal component is the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). The hypothalamus, as both a neural structure and an endocrine gland, can orchestrate the body’s response by stimulating both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine glands. OR and OTS must be viewed on a continuum with a disturbance and adaptation and finally a maladaptation of the HPAA and all other hypothalamic axes (

Meeusen et al., 2013

).



Muscle Trauma and Injury/Cytokine Theory


Microtrauma or tissue injury in muscles can impact both the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system. Activation of the CNS by cytokines explains many of the signs and symptoms of OTS. Anti-inflammatory cytokines define the role of T cells. T cells divide into two distinct functional subsets: TH1, associated with cell-mediated immunity, and TH2, associated with humoral immunity. The up-regulation of TH1 cells primarily depends on IL-12; the up-regulation of TH2 cells primarily depends on IL-4. In addition, IL-4 and IL-10 coordinate to inhibit TH1 development. Thus, IL-10 suppresses cell-mediated immunity and macrophage function. The response to trauma/injury is a shift to a TH2 lymphocyte response, resulting in an up-regulation of humoral immunity and down-regulation of cell-mediated immunity. The individual may thus be more susceptible to URTI (Moldoveanu et al., 2001
; Smith, 2003a
). The binding of cytokines (particularly IL-6) in the hypothalamus activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in the release of E/NE and cortisol (Moldoveanu et al., 2001
; Steinacker et al., 2004
). These stress hormones bring about physical changes and are associated with mood changes such as depression and anxiety. The activation of the hippocampus may explain
 loss of attention and the return of previously corrected errors (Armstrong and vanHeest, 2002
; Keizer, 1998
; Smith, 2000
, 2003b
; Steinacker et al., 2004
). Experimental evidence in support of this cytokine hypothesis is growing (Main et al., 2010
).


Markers and Monitoring of Training to Predict Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)


Research is ongoing to determine the mechanisms of OTS and identify a marker such as a level of some hormone or specific change that could help detect early on whether an athlete is on the brink of overtraining. Once known, this could lead to intervention or, ideally, prevention (Budgett, 1998
; Urhausen and Kindermann, 2000
; Meeusen et al., 2013
).



Despite numerous attempts to identify such a marker, the overwhelming consensus remains that no reliable and valid variable or index is available to predict OTS or even to distinguish among well-trained, overreached, or overtrained athletes. Making matters still more difficult, there is no clear demarcation for when overload becomes overtraining load. The margin between adaptation/supercompensation and the functional impairment of OTS is fluid both among athletes and within individual athletes. Nonetheless, there is consensus that monitoring athletes is extremely important. The difficulty is how and what to monitor (

Achten and Jeukendrup, 2003

;
 
Duclos, 2008

;
 
Flynn, 1998

;
 
Lac and Maso, 2004

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2013

;
 
Urhausen and Kindermann, 2002

). Training, performance, and mood state appear to be reasonable and practical places to begin.



Monitor Training and Recovery


All athletes should be encouraged to keep a daily training log. This should include body weight (with periodic evaluation of body composition), morning resting heart rate (often difficult because many athletes do not like doing this), training goal, training achieved, subjective ratings of perceived exertion during training, fatigue ratings, any noticeable muscle/tendon/joint aches or pains, and any symptoms of URTI (Calder, 2004
).



Athletes should be aware of and report (before beginning the day’s workout) any meaningful changes (a rise ≥10%) in resting heart rate, any muscle/tendon/joint soreness, or URTI symptoms persisting from the day before. These could be indications of insufficient recovery. Therefore, it may be necessary to cut back the volume and intensity of the workout on this day to possibly avoid longer setbacks in the future (

Hooper and Mackinnon, 1995

).




At the end of each macrocycle (see
 
Chapter 1

), the training log should be carefully evaluated to determine the athlete’s response to the training load. The training plan for the next cycle should be based on this evaluation (

Smith, 2003a

).



Monitor Performance


The most obvious item to monitor is, of course, the specific sports performance, including not only the outcome but also the effort involved and apparent recovery. Performance in training workouts should also be monitored. In some events, individualized ergometric tests can reproduce specific levels of performance in the exercise physiology laboratory or training room (Meeusen et al., 2013
; Urhausen and Kindermann, 2002
). Because athletes suffering from OTS often start a normal training workout, race, or other event but do not complete the performance as expected, the analysis should include splits in relation to a predetermined strategy. A two-bout exercise test protocol might be best for detecting differences in training status (Meeusen et al., 2013
).




Meeusen et al. (2004)

 detected subtle differences in HPAA hormonal responses to two bouts of maximal exercise 4 hours apart between cyclists in a well-trained (
N
 = 7) state and in an intentionally overreached state (same seven athletes) and in one diagnosed OTS motocross athlete that would have been missed had only one exercise bout been used. Performance itself was also sensitive to the training status. Time to exhaustion in bout 2 decreased only 3% from bout 1 in the well-trained state, doubled to −6% in the overreached condition, and almost doubled again to −11% in the OTS athlete. Follow-up studies (

Meeusen et al., 2010

;
 
Nederhof et al., 2008

) have supported the sensitivity of the hormonal response (particularly ACTH and prolactin) to a two-bout exercise test in being able to distinguish between NFOR and OTS athletes and NFOR, NFOR recovering, and normal athletes. Performance of an interval shuttle run test (alternately running for 30 seconds and walking for 15 seconds starting at speeds of 10 km·hr
−1
) has also been shown to be sensitive to detecting NFOR (

Schmikli et al., 2011

).




Although some individual studies have reported changes in performance (submaximal and maximal), exercise heart rate, or heart rate variability as a convenient method for monitoring overreaching, a meta-analysis (

Bosquet et al., 2008

) has determined that while such changes are statistically valid, they have very limited practical value for athletes, coaches, and physicians as they typically fall within the day-to-day variability of heart rate.




Performance tests must be conducted after a recovery or regeneration cycle (see
 
Chapter 1

) when adaptation or maladaptation can accurately be evaluated and not confused with the normal fatigue of training (

Fry et al., 1992

;
 
Rowbottom et al., 1998

). This analysis requires, of course, baseline data previously established for the athlete. The Focus on Application box describes a study that suggests that the 20-m shuttle test (20 MST or PACER) may be an easy way to monitor for OTS in team sports athletes.







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Monitoring Overreaching






The authors were concerned about the lack of clear practical tests for nonfunctional overreaching, which is problematic both for scientists studying the issue and for coaches trying to prevent it. They designed their study to investigate changes in a variety of biochemical, immunological, physiological, and psychological markers for monitoring fatigue and recovery.







Eighteen Australian male rugby league players in a semiprofessional club volunteered and were divided into two matched groups. All players completed 6 weeks of five to seven training sessions per week of progressive endurance development, resistance training, speed and agility training, and rugby drills. The intensive training (IT) group was intentionally overtrained, while the other group was normally trained (NT). (The training load for each individual was set using the method of Foster outlined in the Focus on Application—Clinically Relevant box presented later in this chapter.) The average training load for the two groups is presented in the graph below, which shows the IT group did approximately 21% more training than the NT group.








Following 6 weeks of training, all players completed the same taper. This was a step-reduction taper consisting primarily of a reduction in training session duration while maintaining training intensity. The activities included three field sessions and two resistance training sessions.








All players were tested before the training protocol, after the 6 weeks of training (except for the 20 MST run each week), and at the completion of the 7-day taper. All measures were taken after 24 hours of rest after the last training session and at the same time of day. The only significantly different variables between the IT and NT groups after the 6-week overload period were the 20 MST,
 

, and glutamine/glutamate ratio. Because of its ease of administration, only the 20 MST results are discussed here. The NT group incrementally improved their 20 MST performance by approximately 1% per week through the first 5 weeks and then decreased slightly, for an overall improvement of +3.3 ± 7.7% at week 6. In contrast, the IT group showed basically no change through week 3, approximately 1% decrease at week 4, and a decrease of −9.2 ± 3.8% by week 6. After the taper, both groups showed an equal improvement of approximately +6% from the start of the training program, with no difference between groups. These results suggest that the 20 MST may be a useful measure for monitoring response to training and that a short taper is useful even for team sports players.

Monitor Mood State


Subjective ratings of mood, fatigue, athletic and nonathletic stress, and muscle soreness have been suggested as the most cost-effective strategy for early detection of OTS and thus for monitoring training (Hooper and Mackinnon, 1995
; Lehmann et al., 1993
; Meeusen et al., 2013
; Meyers and Whelan, 1998
; Urhausen and Kindermann, 2002
). The Profile of Mood States (POMS) (McNair et al., 1971
) has been most extensively studied. This 65-item test provides subjective ratings of tension-anxiety, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion, and total mood. A shorter 24-item version is also available but is sometimes called the BRUMS, Brunel Mood Scale (Rohlfs et al., 2008
; Terry et al., 2003
). Although Profile of Mood States cannot diagnose OTS, it can document mood changes consistent with the condition (such as increased depression and tension-anxiety and decreased vigor and total mood score) in some athletes (Hawley and Schoene, 2003
; Hooper and Mackinnon, 1995
). The deterioration in mood states often coincides with an increased training load and usually precedes a decrement in performance (Urhausen and Kindermann, 2002
). Athletes with signs of OTS typically exhibit both a greater increase and a different pattern in total mood disturbance than athletes undergoing the same training who remain symptom free. Male and female athletes respond similarly (Meeusen et al., 2013
). Self-analysis questionnaires using well-being ratings can prove useful, including ratings of fatigue, stress level, muscle soreness (especially “heavy” legs), training enjoyment, health concerns, irritability, self-confidence/self-esteem, attitude toward work/study/teammates, communication with teammates and coaches, and sleep quality/disorders. Although verbal reports are very important, all of these items should be recorded in a written training log. Subjective portions of this log require candor and complete honesty by the athlete and must be evaluated in light of training and performance. The usefulness of the log depends heavily on the coach’s or athletic trainer’s interpretation. The RESTQ-76 Sports questionnaire uses a self-report approach to evaluate physical, subjective, behavioral, and social aspects of
 stress and recovery (Kellman and Kallus, 2001
). It is more specific in pinpointing disturbances related to or affecting training and is effective in identifying individuals at risk for OTS although it cannot provide the final diagnosis that someone is already overtrained (Carfagno and Hendrix, 2014
). A newer 22-item questionnaire that includes six distinct symptom clusters (depression, vigor, physical symptoms, sleep disturbance, stress, and fatigue) covering three domains (mood, stress, and behavioral/physical symptoms) is informative for coaches and user-friendly for athletes but requires further validation (Main and Grove, 2009
).


Prevention and Treatment of Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)


Prevention


Attempts to prevent the overtraining syndrome center on periodization of the exercise training with an emphasis on adequate recovery for adaptation and proper nutrition.


PERIODIZATION The key to preventing the OTS is careful periodization of training (see Chapter 1
). It is difficult to attain the delicate balance between overload/progression (avoiding large immediate increases in overload) and sufficient rest/recovery, but this balance is essential for each individual (Meeusen et al., 2013
; Smith, 2003a
). Periodization allows the athlete to peak for specific competitions. Peak performance cannot be maintained indefinitely, so competitions must be prioritized and periodization phases matched to these priorities. The more frequently peaks are attempted, the more vulnerable the athlete is to overtraining (Bompa, 2004
; Smith, 2003a
). Few studies have actually compared the effectiveness of periodization. However, Rhea and Alderman (2004)
 and Steinacker et al. (1998) have shown positive results for strength/power (weight lifting) and aerobic/anaerobic (rowing) programs using periodization.



The main protection against OTS is the inclusion of sufficient recovery after heavy physical training, including each daily training session and each competition. Athletes and coaches indoctrinated with the philosophy of “if some is good, more is better” often find it difficult to accept that “less can actually be more.” Possible components of daily recovery include hydration and refueling as soon as possible to deal with metabolic fatigue; light activity, stretching, and hydrotherapy (showering or pool/spa activities) to deal with neural fatigue; and unwinding with activities such as debriefing or listening to music to deal with psychological fatigue (

Calder, 2004

). This recovery should be monitored. The monitoring system proposed by
 
Kenttä and Hassmén (1998)

 is described in the Focus on Application box. Restful sleep of 8–9 hours

 is often prescribed; however, individuals have different requirements for sleep. What is essential is that the individual athlete sleeps for the amount of time that is required to feel wakeful during the day (

Meeusen et al., 2013

). Sufficient recovery should also be included within the training progression itself through the inclusion of easy days, days of active cross-training, rest days emphasizing stretching and relaxation techniques, and at least 1 day of compete rest per week (

Kenttä and Hassmén, 1998

;
 
Meeusen et al, 2013

). The Focus on Application: Clinically Relevant box also describes a technique for evaluating the adequacy of the variation of training.



NUTRITION Adequate nutrition, with the possible periodization of carbohydrate intake to match glycogen needs, is also critical. A key goal is to ensure sufficient glycogen stores to support high-intensity training or competition. Maintaining blood glucose is also important for attenuating increases in stress hormones (especially cortisol), diminishing the changes in immunity mediated through cytokines. Ingestion of carbohydrate during prolonged high-intensity exercise has been shown to blunt the inflammatory response (Coyle, 2004; Kreider et al., 1998
; Venkatraman and Pendergast, 2002
).



One to two hours of high-intensity exercise or as little as 20–30 minutes of heavy interval training can result in glycogen depletion. As detailed in
 
Chapter 6

, glycogen resynthesis occurs at about 5–6% per hour under optimal dietary conditions, thus requiring approximately 17–20 hours for complete recovery. Optimal conditions involve both the timing and the type of CHO ingestion. Consuming CHO immediately after exercise results in higher glycogen levels 4 hours after exercise than if CHO ingestion is delayed 2 hours. Thus, when the interval between exercise sessions is short (<8 hours), carbohydrate ingestion (50–100 g at the rate of 1.2 g·kg BW
−1
·hr
−1
) should begin as soon after the workout or competition as is practical (15–30 minutes); continue at that rate every 15–20 minutes until a larger meal of solid food (150–250 g of carbohydrate) is desired and possible; and be maintained for at least 4–6 hours (Betts and Williams, 2010;
 
Cermak and van Loon, 2013

; Coyle and Coyle, 1993; Jentjens and Jeukendrup, 2003). When a longer recovery time is available, although the consumption of CHO immediately is not as important, it is recommended (

Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014

). As long as 7–10 g·kg BW
−1
 of CHO is consumed over 24 hours at a rate of at least 50 g·hr
−1
, muscle and liver glycogen will be replaced over this time (

Donaldson et al., 2010

).




Adequate nutrition involves more than just carbohydrate ingestion, however. Athletes in hard training seem to maintain or decrease their spontaneous food

 intake, and a negative energy balance can occur (

Carfagno and Hendrix, 2014

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2013

). Thus, the most basic consideration is that, unless the athlete is trying to lose weight during the general preparatory cycle, caloric intake must balance caloric output. Days of lower carbohydrate intake (if carbohydrate is periodized as suggested) allow for increases in fat and protein while still maintaining caloric balance.




Fat and protein ingestion are critical. Low-fat diets (<20%) compromise endurance performance and lead to possible deficiencies in micronutrients. Both the quantity and type of fats alter immune functioning. Diets very low (<20%) or very high (>60%) in protein have negative effects on immune function as well. Diets unbalanced in fat and protein may be a factor in overtraining. Supplementation with amino acids, however, is not likely to reduce symptoms of fatigue or OR (

Meeusen et al., 2013

).




Hydration, the last critical component, should include both water and sports drinks. Thirst is not a reliable indication of the amount of fluid needed.
 
Chapters 6

 and
 
14

 discuss fluid needs for adequate hydration and rehydration.




The quest to find the foods or nutritional supplements to support the immune system during strenuous training has motivated scientists, athletes, and commercial entities for many years. The accompanying Focus on Application box reviews the current recommendations regarding nutritional supplements to lessen immune disruption with strenuous training.



Treatment


If training adjustments are insufficient and OTS develops, treatment is needed. The first step in treatment is a medical examination to rule out possible illnesses or injuries as the underlying cause of a performance decrement. Once these possible causes have been ruled out, the individual must be guided through a recovery program. This must be done carefully, because active—and especially competitive—individuals often resist recommendations to cut down or cease training. Rest may be a naughty four-letter word to an athlete, but rest is the only established treatment. Reduced training may be sufficient for recovery in some cases of OR, but recovery from OTS requires rest (Meneses-Echavez et al., 2015
; Mujika and Padilla, 2000
).




Armstrong and VanHeest (2002)

 point out that OTS and clinical (major) depression involve very similar signs and symptoms, brain structures, neurotransmitters, endocrine pathways, and immune responses and thus probably have similar causes. Given these communalities, they and others American College of Sports Medicine (

ACSM, 2000

) suggest treating overtrained athletes with antidepressant medications and professional psychological counseling. Research supporting the use of specific antidepressants is needed.




Just as there is no definitive marker for overtraining, so too is there no definitive marker to indicate recovery. Resumption of training must be individualized on the basis of signs and symptoms and be gradual. The best “treatment,” of course, is prevention (

ACSM, 2000

;
 
Flynn, 1998

;
 
Meeusen et al., 2013

).

Ratings of Perceived Exertion and Recovery






Researchers have begun to promote monitoring the adequacy of recovery from training using rating scales. One system (Kenttä and Hassmén, 1998
) proposes assessing recovery from training using two total quality recovery (TQR) scales. The TQR perceived (TQRper
) scale is a subjective rating by the individual to the query “How do you rate your overall recovery for the previous 24 hours?” The TQR action scale (TQRact
) allows the athlete to accumulate “recovery points” based on his/her activities in the previous 24 hours. Up to 10 points can be awarded for nutrition and hydration, up to 4 for sleep and rest, up to 3 for relaxation and emotional support, and up to 3 for stretching and active rest. Because the point values for the action items are not set in stone but are determined by the athlete and his/her coach or trainer, specific point values should be established before implementing this scale. Based on this system, recovery is adequate if both the TQRper
 and TQRact
 are at or above the training stress value as measured by the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (Borg, 1998
) for the workout preceding the recovery.








Foster (1998)

 bases his technique on Borg’s category ratio scale (CR10) (

Borg, 1998

) and the duration of each day’s workout, multiplying the two together to obtain a training session load. Each week, the mean and standard deviation of the training load are computed as an index of training variability. The monotony of the weekly training load is calculated by dividing the daily mean load by the standard deviation (SD). A small SD and a high quotient indicate little day-to-day variation, that is, high monotony. The strain of the weekly load is determined by multiplying the daily load by 7 d·wk
−1
 and the monotony factor. Both consistent high training monotony and high training strain appear related to training maladaptation.








The example below shows how simply substituting one rest day for a long cycling ride reduces the training monotony and strain. Many elite athletes work at a training load of 4,000 U·wk
−1
; thus, the 7-day-a-week program would be considered excessive even for an elite athlete. This biathlete could substitute the long bike ride for the long run on alternate weeks.





A.Daily Mean Load 591


Standard Deviation of Daily Load 396


Monotony (daily load ÷ SD) 1.49


Weekly Load (daily load × 7) 4,140

Selected Interactions of Exercise and Immune Function




Exercise, the Immune System, and Upper Respiratory Tract Infection


Many people believe that individuals who exercise regularly are less likely to acquire a cold or the flu, whereas others believe that highly trained, competitive athletes are more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). This section considers scientific evidence that both positions are probably correct. The relationship between exercise and URTI is apparently mediated by the exercise intensity and overall training load (Gleeson, 2007
: Mackinnon, 1999
; Matthews et al., 2002
; Nieman, 2000
, 2012
; Nieman et al., 1990
, 1993
; Trochimak and Hübner-Wozniak, 2012
).




Figure 22.6

 shows a schematic model explaining the relationship between exercise and incidence of infection. This model suggests that exercise is a stressor that can lead to immunomodulation (either immunoenhancement or immunosuppression) via various mechanisms and that immune enhancement or suppression can lead to a decreased or increased risk of infections, respectively.




As discussed earlier, an acute bout of exercise leads to changes in immune cell number and cell function.
 
Figure 22.13

 presents the “open window” hypothesis, which suggests that the suppression of immune function is greater and more prolonged after severe exercise than after moderate exercise (Pedersen and Ullum, 1994). Notices the similarities between the data presented in
 
Figure 22.7

 and the theoretical curve in
 
Figure 22.13

, which depicts NK cell activity. The suppression of the T cells and NK cells during recovery from strenuous exercise may provide a period of increased susceptibility (the “open window” represented by the rectangular shaded area) for infection. This hypothesis is not universally accepted. Changes in immune cell number and function measured in recovery may have little or no effect on health outcomes, such as infections (

Rowbottom and Green, 2000

). Or the decrease in immune cells in the blood may reflect their movement into tissue where they can provide increased immune surveillance and even immunoenhancement (

Edwards et al., 2007

). However, there is a consensus that immune cell number and function, as well as other measures of immune function, are suppressed for at least several hours during recovery from prolonged, intense endurance exercise (

Walsh et al., 2011a

,
 
b

).

The Role of Nutritional Supplements in Lessening Immune Disruption with Strenuous Training






Walk into any nutritional supplement store (or even your local grocery store or drug store) and you will see numerous supplements claiming to boost immune function. Nutritional supplements to bolster immunity have long been used during periods of physiological stress, such as during surgery or during recovery from trauma. This has led many to speculate that nutritional agents may be useful in attenuating immune changes and inflammation following strenuous exercise and thus may lower the risk of upper respiratory tract infection. While there are theoretical reasons to believe that different supplements may be useful and some evidence in animal models to suggest the utility of supplementation, the majority of studies conducted with human athletes have been disappointing.







The International Society of Exercise and Immunology recently published a Position Statement on Immune Function and Exercise. In that statement, they reviewed many of the proposed nutritional supplements and their rationale for use and provided a recommendation based on current research literature (see accompanying table).








The results of this systematic analysis suggest that there are few nutritional supplements that are effective in dampening immune disruption with exercise or in reducing risk of upper respiratory tract infection in well-fed healthy athletes. An exception appears to be carbohydrate supplementation. Carbohydrate ingestion before and/or during prolonged exercise attenuates the increase in blood neutrophil and monocyte counts, stress hormones, and anti-inflammatory cytokines but has little or no effect on decrements in salivary IgA output and T-cell and NKC activity. Thus, carbohydrate ingestion during heavy exercise may provide a partial countermeasure to inflammatory responses associated with exercise.








There are also some encouraging research findings regarding quercetin, a dietary polyphenol found in tea, apples, some fruits (e.g., apples, grapes, citrus fruits, raspberries, cranberries), and green leafy vegetables. Most of the research on the effectiveness of this supplement has been done in animal models, and more work is required in humans; however, initial results are encouraging. Importantly, quercetin is found in many foods that are recommended as part of a healthy diet.








While the idea of a nutritional supplement to boast immune function is attractive, the available evidence suggests that athletes should eat a sound healthy diet, ensure they have sufficient carbohydrates immediately before or after exercise, and perhaps recover with a cup of green tea.

Effect of Football Training on Upper Respiratory Tract Infection and Salivary IgA






Coaches and athletes are concerned about URTI infections because they impair performance and may limit the ability to train. Given the detrimental effects, many are interested in finding immune markers to predict who is at risk for a URTI. Salivary immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) is a potential marker to predict URTI because the oral mucosa is the first line of defense against pathogens that may enter the body through this route.







Researchers investigated s-IgA and incidence of URTI in collegiate football players and normally active controls over 12 months. Data collected at eight specific times representing different training phases included both s-IgA data and self-reported data about symptoms of URTI.








As seen in the graph accompanying, the incidence of URTI increased dramatically following the first 6 weeks of training in both the fall and spring season (times 2 and 6, respectively) and during the fall and spring season (times 3 and 7). Analysis of the s-IgA data revealed that both the concentration of s-IgA and the secretion rate of s-IgA decreased in the football players during the same period. A regression analysis of these data revealed that the rate of s-IgA secretion was the most predictive of URTI.








These results have several important implications for those who work with athletes. Following intensive preseason training and during the in-season training phase, the incidence of URTI may be very high (>50%) among athletes—much higher than among normally active controls. The increased incidence of URTI is associated with suppression of s-IgA. The exact cause for this higher incidence of URTI is not certain but likely includes the stress of intensive training and competition along with more frequent exposure to the infections of other players because football players spend so much time in close contact. One interesting finding was that s-IgA secretion rates below 40 mg·min
−1
 were predictive of URTI, suggesting that in the future coaches and trainers may be able to measure this variable to predict who is at greatest risk for developing a URTI and who would therefore benefit from reduced training.

Exercise Training and Incidence of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)


Initial epidemiological studies supported the theory that prolonged, strenuous exercise, such as marathon running, led to a higher incidence of URTI (Nieman, 1997b
). On the other hand, moderate exercise training has been associated with a lower self-reported incidence of URTI (Matthews et al., 2002
). Based on these findings, a J-shaped model of the relationship between exercise workload and risk of URTI (see Figure 22.14
) has been proposed (Nieman et al., 1990
; Trochimak and Hübner-Wozniak, 2012
; Woods et al., 1999
). This model suggests that a moderate level of exercise is beneficial but that very high levels of training may be detrimental. However, not all studies have found intense training associated with an increased risk of URTI (Gleeson et al., 1996; Hemilä et al., 2003
; Pyne et al., 1995
). Thus, although the theory that intense training may lead to an increase incidence of URTI has some support, the research findings are not unequivocal. Furthermore, some researchers have questioned whether reported sore throats following intense training periods are due to URTI or rather an inflammation caused by dry mucosal lining in the throat. A study investigated both self-reported symptoms and incidence of pathogenic infection in sedentary controls, recreationally competitive athletes, and elite athletes. In this study, the distribution of symptoms mimicked the J-shaped curve. However, in only 30% of cases were pathogens identified as causing a URTI (Spence et al., 2005
). It is also possible that URTI is linked to allergic reactions, which are noninfectious inflammations. In a study of recreational level marathoners, a positive pre-event Allergy Questionnaire for Athletes (AQUA) was a significant predictor of postmarathon URTI symptoms. In addition, a low proportion of households in which both runners and nonrunners were symptomatic suggested that the URTI symptoms were allergic or inflammatory based rather than infectious (Robson-Ansley et al., 2012
).

On balance, research suggests that moderate exercise enhances immune function and may play an important role in reducing an individual’s susceptibility to infection. Exercise is immunomodulatory; whether exercise is immunosuppressive or immunopotentiating likely depends on the overall magnitude of the stress, including not only the physiological stress of exercise but also environmental, psychological, and nutritional stress. The immune response to exercise is mediated largely through the neuroendocrine system. Currently, evidence is insufficient to recommend any given laboratory test of immune function to ascertain whether an individual is at high risk for an infectious episode linked with overtraining or psychological stress. See the Focus on Research box for a look at how investigators are exploring this possibility.



Precautions to Lessen Risk of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)


Because competitive endurance athletes often do not have the option of training moderately, the precautions listed below can help lessen their risk of URTI (Brenner et al., 1994
; Gunzer et al., 2012
; He et al., 2013
; Heath et al., 1992
; Nieman, 1994
; Robson-Ansley et al., 2012
; Walsh et al., 2011a
,b
):



1.
 Eat a well-balanced diet. Improper nutrition can compound the negative influence of heavy exertion on the immune system. Both carbohydrate and optimal vitamin D status appear to be particularly important.




2.
 Minimize other life stresses. Psychological stress may be additive

.




3.
 Avoid overtraining and chronic fatigue. Get plenty of rest, and space vigorous workout and race events as far apart as possible.




4.
 Consume plenty of carbohydrates before and/or during prolonged exercise.




5.
 Get a flu shot. Flu shots are especially important for athletes competing in the winter.




6.
 Avoid excessive muscular soreness. Soreness may activate immune system involvement, and interfere with its ability to ward off viruses.




7.
 Try to avoid being around sick people.




8.
 Be tested for allergies and take competition approved allergy medications if needed.



Guidelines for Postponing Training Due to Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)


One of the challenges facing exercise enthusiasts, athletes, and occupational workers is knowing when exercise can be safely and effectively performed during an illness. The following guidelines suggest when exercise training is and is not appropriate.



1.
 Maintain training if the URTI is only minor and a systemic infection is lacking (no fever, aching muscles, extreme fatigue, or swollen glands); or just stop for a couple of days. Consider using decongestants during the day and antihistamines at night.




2.
 If the URTI causes positive signs of systemic infection (fever, aching muscles, extreme fatigue, swollen glands), stop training for 2–4 weeks. If training is not stopped, viral cardiomyopathy or severe viral infection may result.




3.
 If symptoms occur above the neck (runny or stuffy nose, scratchy throat), begin sessions with a short or light activity. If symptoms worsen, stop; if symptoms lessen, continue. If symptoms are below the neck (muscle ache, vomiting, diarrhea, fever), stop training until the symptoms go away.



Exercise, the Immune System, and Cancer



Figure 22.15
 presents hazard ratios for 13 different cancer types in which higher amounts of leisure-time activity (90th percentile [in many studies equivalent to the recommended 150 min.
wk−1
] vs. 10th percentile) were shown to reduce the risk for developing these cancers (Moore et al., 2016
). The easiest way to interpret the hazard ratios is to subtract the ratio from 1.00 and multiply that value by 100. For example, esophageal cancer has a hazard ratio of 0.58. 1.00−0.58 = 0.42 × 100= 42%. This means that those participating in high levels of leisure-time physical activity have a 42% reduced risk of developing esophageal cancer. The other 12 cancer risks vary from a reduction of 27–10%. For 7 of the cancers, the risk reduction was 20% or more. These results were based on data from 12 prospective US and European studies with self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity. A total of 1.44 million participants aged 19–98 years (57% female) were involved. Twenty-six different cancers were assessed. In addition to the 13 where risk was lower with higher physical activity, 9 showed no significant effect of activity level and 2 (malignant melanoma and prostate cancer) showed a higher risk with higher activity. Greater sun exposure from exercising outdoors is likely the cause of the
 increased risk for melanoma. The investigators could not determine any biological rationale for the increase in prostate cancer but postulated that screening bias (more active people are also more likely to see a doctor for routine screenings) might have had an impact. The associations were generally similar between overweight/obese and normal-weight individuals. Smoking modified the associations for lung cancer but not other smoking-related cancers. The authors concluded that these findings support promoting physical activity as a key component of population-wide cancer prevention and control efforts. Note: this does not imply that physical activity is an absolute protection against even some cancers. It simply means a lower risk. How does cancer develop and how can physical activity/exercise training lower the risk of this happening? Obviously, the immune system is involved.

The duel between the immune system and cancer develops in three phases: (1) elimination, (2) equilibrium, and (3) escape. Phase 1 represents immune surveillance and action. Tumor cells are detected by cells of both the innate (especially NK cells) and adaptive immune system (especially T cells). Some of the cancer cells are eliminated. In phase 2, tumor cells are contained but not eradicated; growth is abated, but the tumor is not destroyed. Mutations begin to occur by the tumor cells, and these become resistant to being killed. Unstable malignant cells escape antigen-specific T-cell recognition by antigenic loss or up-regulation of immunosuppressive mediators. Finally, in phase 3, as a result of these immunoevasive mechanisms and mutations, the malignant cells escape containment and uncontrolled tumor growth occurs (

Bigley et al., 2013

;
 
Koelwyn et al., 2015

).




The interaction between the growth of cancer cells, the overwhelming of the immune system, and chronic exercise training can probably best be explained by adding the additional factor of age into the explanation. While individuals of all ages contract cancer, the incidence of the disease increases with age. Over 60% of new cancer cases and 70% of cancer deaths occur in individuals aged ≥65 years. Cancer is the second leading cause of death for all ages (birth to >80 years), but the leading cause for individuals aged 40–80 years. From birth to age 49 years, the probability of developing invasive cancer is 3.4% or 1 in 29. This rises to 34.6% (1 in 3) over the age of 70 years (

Siegel et al., 2016

). With age comes immunosenescence.
 
Figure 22.16

 diagrams several critical factors in these age-related immune system changes and the impact of exercise on them.










FIGURE 22.16
 The Interaction of Age, Immune Function, and Activity Status.
 Aging causes detrimental changes in the immune system leading to an increased risk of a variety of cancers and decreased probability for a good prognosis. Chronic activity/exercise training can improve these detrimental changes, decrease the risk of contracting cancer, and improve the prognosis for a good outcome. Sources
: Based on information from Archer et al. (2011); Bigley et al. (2013); Koelwyn et al. (2015).





Aging increases proinflammatory monocytes, which leads to elevated levels of local and circulating proinflammatory cytokines (

Figure 22.16A

). This chronic, low-grade inflammation creates a tumor-promoting environment. Although extreme exercise such as marathon running or a full triathlon can be proinflammatory, in most instances, moderate endurance and resistance exercise is anti-inflammatory (

Koelwyn et al., 2015

;
 
Lancaster and Febbraio, 2014

). Aging is associated with decreased NK cell expression in activating receptors and function (

Figure 22.16B

). Chronic aerobic and resistance exercise have shown promise as a means of increasing NK cell toxicity in older individuals. Antigen presentation is impaired

 in the elderly (

Figure 22.16C

). Monocytes become macrophages. Macrophages are important in antigen presentation to activate T cells. Exercise enhances the cytotoxic, antigen-presenting, and tumor-suppressive functions of monocytes and macrophages. Maintenance of equilibrium (phase 2 above) requires vigorous T-cell responses. T cells recognize, regulate, and eradicate cancer cells (

Koelwyn et al., 2015

). Unfortunately, aging is associated with an accumulation of functionally exhausted, senescent suppressor CD8
+
 T cells that are incapable of replicating sufficiently (

Figure 22.16D

). To compound matters, senescent T cells have also been shown to suppress other immune activities (

Figure 22.16E

). In addition, a T-cell pool with a large receptor diversity (TCR diversity) is needed to fight all of the novel mutations that premalignant cells undergo in an effort to escape immunological containment. Older individuals have marked age-driven reductions in TCR diversity in both the CD4
+
 and CD8
+
 T-cell subsets (

Figure 22.16F

). Increasing scores for cardiovascular/aerobic fitness have been shown to be associated with increased proportions of naive (new) CD8
+
 T cells and decreased proportions of senescent/exhausted CD4
+
 and CD8
+
 T cells. Exercise training in previously sedentary older individuals has been shown to enhance T-cell proliferation (

Bigley et al., 2013

). Taken together, these changes offer possible, although not definitive, evidence for the value of exercise in the fight against cancer in older individuals. Of course, the benefits of acute and chronic exercise on the immune system not tied completely to senescence would operate in younger individuals as well.




In addition to aging, body composition is an important contributor to inflammation. When an individual becomes obese, the immune cell profile changes. Specifically, the proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages, eosinophils, and CD4
+
 T cells decreases, and the proportions of proinflammatory activated macrophages, neutrophils, B cells, and CD8
+
 T cells increase. These changes initiate a state of local inflammation. As stated previously, chronic inflammation (whether from chronic infections, improper immune function, autoimmune disease, aging, or obesity) is association with increased cancer risk. Exercise/exercise training has the potential (especially in conjunction with dietary control) to limit body fat accumulation and favorably alter lipid profiles to one that is associated with reduced inflammation. In addition, exercising muscles release myokines (specific cytokines released in response to muscle contraction), including IL-6. IL-6, in turn, stimulates the production of IL-1 receptor antagonists blocking the proinflammatory actions of IL-1α and IL-1β. This action contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise and the possible mediation of cancer (

Brandt and Pedersen, 2010

;
 
Koelwyn et al., 2015

;
 
Lancaster and Febbraio, 2014

).




Current evidence suggests that exercise/exercise training is a promising strategy to alter numerous components of the immune system and, in turn, the development and progress of cancer. However, there remain many important knowledge gaps (

Koelwyn et al., 2015

). Despite these many unknowns, there seems to be basically universal agreement that exercise training is an important component in the treatment and prognosis for cancer survivors.




By definition, cancer survivorship occurs from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. The continuum of cancer survivorship includes acute treatment and recovery, long-term disease-free or stable disease, and living with advanced cancer (

Rock et al., 2012

;
 
Schmitz et al., 2010

). All major cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal) have side effects that impact normal physiological functioning of the cardiorespiratory, neuromuscular-endocrine, immune, and gastrointestinal systems (

Schmidtz et al., 2010

). Evidence strongly suggests that not only is exercise safe and feasible during cancer treatment, but that it can improve these impacted physiological functions and various aspects of quality of life. Generically then, the typical adaptations that occur with both aerobic and resistance exercise training in health-related physical fitness components (cardiorespiratory, body composition, and muscular strength/endurance) are beneficial to most cancer survivors including those with advanced disease (

Rock et al., 2012

;
 
Salakari et al., 2015

). Specifically, two major symptoms that are associated with cancer treatment are tumor-induced cachexia (a multifactorial wasting syndrome including loss of muscle mass) and cancer-related fatigue. Recent literature indicates a role of chronic exercise in modulating cachexia (

Bloch et al., 2013

;
 
Lira et al., 2015

). Several systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses (

Dennett et al., 2016

;
 
Meneses-Echavez et al., 2015

;
 
Tian et al., 2016

) have shown that aerobic and resistance exercise training (with or without stretching) has a beneficial effect on the management of cancer-related fatigue both during secondary treatment (e.g., radiation after surgery) and after all treatment.




There is a consensus among the American Cancer Society (

Rock et al., 2012

), the American College of Sports Medicine (

Schmitz et al., 2010

), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (

Physical Activities Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008

) that individuals with cancer should:




1.
 Avoid inactivity and return to normal daily activities as soon as possible following diagnosis.




2.
 Aim to exercise at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.




3.
 Include strength training exercises at least 2 days per week.




Obviously, exercise prescriptions should be individualized according to a cancer survivor’s pretreatment fitness level, any additional preexisting medical complications, cancer site-specific considerations, response to treatment, and any persistent negative effects of treatment. Individuals unable to meet the goals listed above should be encouraged to be as physically active as the condition allows, keeping in mind that “some exercise is always better than no exercise.”




More recommendations for specific cancers are listed in the ACSM’s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription (

ACSM, 2014

). In 2009, the American College of Sports Medicine in collaboration with the

 American Cancer Society developed a Certified Cancer Exercise Trainer program (

http://certification.acsm.org/acsm-cancer-exercise trainer

). A wide array of health care professionals as well as athletic trainers and other certified ACSM fitness providers may qualify to take the program.

Exercise, the Immune System, and AIDS



Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
 is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and characterized by severe CD4 cell depletion. This virus infects the CD4-bearing T cells (helper T cells), which orchestrate much of the immune response of the body. As the infection progresses, there is greater depletion of the CD4 cells, leading ultimately to immunodysregulation (Brenner et al., 1994
). HIV infection progresses through three stages (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016a
,b
):



1.
 Acute HIV infection:
 Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, the individual may/may not experience a flu-like illness (fever, headache, rash) that may last for a few weeks. During this stage, the virus infects relatively few CD4-bearing cells but multiplies and spreads throughout the body rapidly. It is not clinically detectable except by blood testing. These individuals are viral carriers and infectious despite the absence of outward signs of infection.




2.
 Clinical latency (HIV inactivity or dormancy)
: This stage is sometimes called
 asymptomatic HIV infection
 or
 chronic HIV infection.
 Infected individuals may/may not have any symptoms, and even if they are not taking any medications, this period can last up to 10 years. Individuals taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications can live in this stage for several decades. HIV continues to multiply but at very low levels. HIV-positive individuals in this stage can infect others although those consistently taking HAART medications are less likely to do so. At the end of this phase, the viral count starts to go up and the CD4 cell count to go down. Symptoms are likely to occur.




3.
 AIDS
: Severe CD4 cell depletion occurs along with major complications resulting from opportunistic infection (e.g., pneumonia or tuberculosis) or cancer malignancies. At this stage of the disease, individuals can be very infectious. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years.




More than 1.2 million individuals in the United States are living with HIV infection, and almost 13% of them are unaware of their infection. Over the past decade, the number of individuals living with HIV has increased, while the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable at about 500,000 per year. Approximately 14,000 individuals were estimated to have died from AIDS in 2012 (the latest year for which statistics are available).




The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically changed the treatment of HIV and AIDS, significantly lessening the mortality and opportunistic infections. As a result of this new treatment, HIV infection is now treated as a chronic illness, although as shown by the quoted statistics, it remains a life-threatening disease (

Ciccolo et al., 2004

;
 
O’Brien et al., 2004

;
 
Quiles and Garber, 2014

). The downside is that HAART treatment results in serious adverse effects, including headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, disorders of glucose metabolism, lipodystrophy syndrome (abnormal fat redistribution and metabolic disturbances), damage to the liver, bone metabolism abnormalities, and increase in cardiovascular disease. Exercise is a possible management strategy for many of these problems, but it is often difficult to maintain an exercise program in face of these challenges. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that aerobic and resistance training confers benefit to individuals with HIV and AIDS either singly or in combination, with beneficial effects for cardiorespiratory fitness, improved lipid and glucose levels, increased strength and flexibility, and decreased accumulation of fat in the trunk area of HIV-positive individuals. Importantly, the training has been found to be both safe and effective even during HAART treatment and does not appear to have any adverse effects on the disease progression (

Gomes-Neto et al., 2013

,
 
2015

;
 
O’Brien et al., 2004

;
 
Quiles and Garber, 2014

;
 
Shephard, 2015

).




Exercise prescription principles for healthy adults can generally apply to persons with HIV with necessary modifications according to their individual health status. The exercise training program should include cardiorespiratory activity ≥5 days per week if moderate intensity or ≥3 days per week if vigorous intensity. Two to three days per week of resistance training for the major muscles groups and flexibility exercises for the major muscle-tendon units are also recommended (

Quiles and Garber, 2014

).





SUMMARY





1.
 The immune system can be functionally divided into the innate and the adaptive branches. The innate branch protects against foreign substances or cells without having to recognize them. In the adaptive branch of the immune system, immune cells recognize a foreign material and react specifically and selectively to destroy it.




2.
 Moderate aerobic exercise leads to an increase in the number and activity of neutrophils; an increase in the number, percentage, and activity of NK cells; an increase in phagocytic activity and secretion of cytokines from macrophages; an increase in the number of acute phase proteins; and an increase in the number of B and T cells.




3.
 Exhaustive aerobic exercise is associated with a reduction in NK cell number and activity and a decrease in lymphocytes and neutrophils.




4.
 The depressed levels of NK cells following strenuous exercise are a likely explanation of the vulnerability

 to acute infection associated with high-level competition and chronic overtraining.




5.
 The neuroendocrine system and the immune system overlap considerably. Hormonal control of the immune response is mediated primarily by the action of epinephrine and cortisol.




6.
 A sustained mismatch between exercise training stress and inadequate recovery can lead to training maladaptation. Maladaptation occurs over a continuum. The least serious is functional overreaching (FOR). FOR refers to short-term performance decrement (days to weeks) and is often done intentionally during a shock microcycle of periodization. Non-functional overreaching (NFOR) is more severe with a performance decrement that lasts from weeks to months and usually is accompanied by severe signs and symptoms. The overtraining syndrome (OTS) is the most serious stage of the continuum with the greatest disruption and a performance recovery that takes months to years.




7.
 Although no single marker has been identified to predict NFOR or OTS, it is important to monitor training load, performance, and mood state and ensure adequate rest/recovery and nutrition in an attempt to prevent maladaptation. The primary treatment is rest.




8.
 Severe exercise training is associated with immunosuppression and an increased risk of URTI.




9.
 Physical activity is associated with lower prevalence and mortality rates for at least thirteen cancers including breast, bladder and colon. Exercise training is important for individuals at all stages of cancer survivorship regardless of the type of cancer involved.




10.
 Exercise training appears to be beneficial to individuals infected with HIV.
