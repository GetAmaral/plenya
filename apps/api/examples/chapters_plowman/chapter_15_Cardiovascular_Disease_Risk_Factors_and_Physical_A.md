Introduction




Earlier in this unit, a distinction was made between the application of the training principles for the achievement of health and for fitness. The health factor of primary concern in this chapter is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects an estimated 85 million Americans (one in three) and has been the leading cause of death in the United States every year since 1900, except 1918. Cardiovascular disease is the underlying cause of over 30% of all deaths in the United States. Nearly 2,200 Americans die from CVD every day, an average of one every 40 seconds (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). Worldwide, cardiovascular disease is also increasing as a cause of death and disability.



Several terms have a very specific meaning in regard to statistics about disease.
 Prevalence
 refers to the number of cases of a disease in a specific population at a given time.
 Incidence
 is the rate of new cases of a disease in a specific population.
 Mortality
 is the number of deaths in a population.
 Morbidity
 refers to the number of people with a sickness or disease in a population.






Prevalence
 The number of cases of a disease in a specific population at a given time.



Incidence
 The rate of new cases of a disease in a specific population.



Mortality
 The number of deaths in a population.



Morbidity
 The number of people with a sickness or disease in a population.



Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)
 Also called coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease, CHD results from damage to the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle (myocardium).



Atherosclerosis
 A pathological process that results in the buildup of plaque inside blood vessels.



Arteriosclerosis
 The natural aging changes that occur in blood vessels, including thickening of the walls, loss of elastic connective tissue, and hardening of the vessel wall.






Figure 15.1

 depicts the number of CVD deaths in the United States from 2000 to 2012 (

Mozaffarian et al., 2015

). Coronary heart disease (arteriosclerosis in coronary arteries) continues to account for the highest percentage of total CVD deaths, with the remainder of CVD deaths attributed to strokes and other CVD (e.g., congenital heart defects, heart valve problems). Total CVD deaths have declined 33% over the 12-year span reported, yet CVD remains the leading cause of death among adults in the United States.

In addition to the emotional tragedy of lives cut short, the economic cost of CVD is staggering. In 2012, the total direct medical costs of CVD were $396 billion (

Mozaffarian et al., 2015

). By 2030, these costs are projected to increase to $918 billion. Furthermore, indirect costs (cost attributed to lost productivity) are estimated to reach $290 billion in 2030. Thus, the total projected cost of CVD in 2030 is a staggering $1.2 trillion.




Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes coronary heart disease (which can lead to heart attack, also called
 myocardial infarction
), stroke, hypertension, heart failure, diseases of the arteries, congenital cardiovascular defects, rheumatic heart diseases, and other diseases. Coronary heart disease is the most common form of heart disease, accounting for approximately 50% of all CVD (

Mozaffarian et al., 2015

).





Figure 15.2

 presents the incidence of heart attack with advancing age. Advancing age increases the possibility of death from heart attack, but being young is not an automatic protection from impairment or death. This figure also illustrates the important point that the death rate from heart attack is not consistent across gender or ethnic groups. Black men have the highest incidence of heart attacks, with black men having a higher incidence than white men in every age category. Similarly, black women have a higher incidence of heart attack than do white women.

Progression of Coronary Heart Disease





Coronary heart disease (CHD)
 (also called coronary artery disease
 or ischemic heart disease
) results from damage to the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle (myocardium). Coronary heart disease often leads to a heart attack, which may or may not be fatal. The damage to the coronary artery is caused by atherosclerosis
, an inflammatory disease arising in response to endothelial cell injury or dysfunction (Libby and Theroux, 2005
) and characterized by lipid accumulation (plaque) in the arterial wall. In contrast to atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis
 encompasses the natural aging changes that occur in blood vessels—namely, thickening of the wall, loss of elastic connective tissue, and hardening of the vessel wall.



While this text cannot fully describe the pathology of atherosclerosis, a basic comprehension of the evolution of atherosclerotic plaque formation is needed to understand how cardiovascular risk factors are related to disease and how exercise training can effectively reduce CVD.




The process of atherosclerosis begins with damage to the endothelium of the artery. The initial injury to the endothelial cells of the arterial wall may result from chemical irritants in tobacco smoke, the turbulent blood flow resulting from hypertension, hyperglycemia, high cholesterol (specifically low-density lipoprotein cholesterol—LDL-C) levels, immune complexes, vasoconstrictor substances, homocysteine (a proclotting factor), and viral or bacterial infection (

Libby, 2006

). Damaged endothelium allows LDL-C to enter the arterial wall and become oxidized (modified) by free radicals (see the Focus on Application box in
 
Chapter 5

). Oxidized

 LDL-C in the arterial wall initiates an inflammatory response that attracts immune cells (macrophages) into the arterial wall. An inflammatory response by the immune system is a normal reaction to such an injury (see
 
Figure 22.3

). Macrophages ingest (phagocytize) the LDL-C and release chemicals that stimulate smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of the vessel wall to divide and migrate into the intima. The result of this complex process is the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque (or lesion) inside the blood vessels composed of connective tissue, smooth muscle cells, cellular debris, cholesterol, and, in advanced cases, calcium. This leads to an increased thickness of the tunica intima layer and can seriously decrease the internal diameter of the coronary artery.
 
Figure 15.3

 summarizes the process of atherosclerotic plaque development.










FIGURE 15.3
 Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaque.
 A.
 Atherosclerosis is initiated by damage to the endothelial lining of the vessel wall allowing LDL-C to enter the vessel wall. B.
 LDL-C in the intimal layer of the arterial wall is oxidized, leading to an inflammatory response, which is evident by the entry of macrophages into the arterial wall. C.
 Macrophages ingest the oxidized lipids and release chemical signals that enhance the inflammatory response and signal smooth muscle division and migration into the tunica intima, resulting in an atherosclerotic plaque that increases intimal thickness.





The growing plaque can interfere with arterial function in many ways. Early in the progression of atherosclerosis, there is evidence of endothelial dysfunction (an impaired ability to vasodilate in response to increased need for blood flow). As the plaque progresses, it can cause narrowing of the artery to the extent that blood flow cannot increase sufficiently during periods of increased cardiac work (causing pain called
 angina pectoris
 if in the chest or
 claudication
 if in the legs). Plaque can also cause turbulent blood flow that may lead to the rupture of an aneurism or further injury to the endothelium. Finally, advanced atherosclerotic plaque is highly thrombotic, meaning that if the plaque ruptures, the material in the plaque will lead to the formation of a blood clot that could occlude a coronary artery, leading to a heart attack (or a stroke if

 an artery to the brain is occluded). If the affected area of the myocardium is small, the individual may recover from the heart attack. However, if the affected area of the myocardium is large, the heart can no longer pump blood, and the heart attack will be fatal. The process of atherosclerotic plaque development may begin in childhood and progress for years before any clinical symptoms of disease occur (

Squires, 1998

).



The Influence of Exercise Training on Atherosclerosis


While there is substantial evidence that regular physical exercise delays the development of atherosclerosis and decreases the risk of cardiovascular mortality, the direct impact of exercise training on the process of atherosclerosis has been difficult to document in humans. In a 1992 study (Schuler et al., 1992
), a group of patients were placed on a low-fat diet (<20% of total calories, <200 mg of cholesterol) and a high-intensity daily aerobic exercise program (75% HRmax). This study showed that 32% of the subjects experienced a regression in their coronary atherosclerotic lesions, 45% stayed the same, and only 23% exhibited a progression in their lesions. These changes were significantly better than the changes in the control group, who were advised to eat less fat and to exercise but were left to their own initiative. Other studies have supported this tendency (Froelicher, 1990
; LaFontaine, 1994
; Squires and Williams, 1993
; Wood and Stefanick, 1990
). Nordstrom et al. (2003)
 found that physical activity during leisure, although not workplace physical activity, was inversely related to the progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis.



Exercise training has been shown to improve endothelial function and myocardial perfusion in patients with coronary heart disease (

Gielen and Hambrecht, 2001

;
 
Gielen et al., 2002

). These beneficial effects appear to be mediated through increased nitric oxide (NO) availability (

Linke et al., 2006

). However, much of the influence of physical activity or exercise training on atherosclerosis is mediated through changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Of course, it is also probable that changes in those risk factors lessen the risk of CVD by effecting positive changes in endothelial function, including the increased production of NO.



Ideal Cardiovascular Health


Ideal cardiovascular health is a new concept that is being espoused by the American Heart Association (AHA) to promote improved health outcomes and to lessen disease burden. Ideal cardiovascular health
 is defined as the absence of manifest CVD together with the simultaneous presences of optimal levels of seven cardiovascular health metrics (health behaviors or factors) (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). The cardiovascular health metrics include four health behaviors (not smoking, getting sufficient physical activity, having a healthy diet pattern, and normal body weight) and three health factors (optimal total cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose). Table 15.1
 presents definitions for poor, intermediate, and ideal cardiovascular health for each of the cardiovascular health metrics for adults and children. Figure 15.4
 presents the prevalence (percentage) of adults who have values in the ideal category for each of the metrics over time. The prevalence of these ideal metrics varies from 0.5 (healthy diet patterns) to 78% (never smoked or former smoker who has quit for at
 least 12 months).

Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Risk Factors





While the concept of ideal cardiovascular health is an attractive option for the promotion of positive cardiovascular health, many researchers and practitioners continue to focus on identifiable risk factors for developing CVD. The emphasis on risk factors assumes that if an individual can be identified as “at risk,” then interventions can be designed to treat or lessen that risk. Obviously, focusing on risk factors or ideal cardiovascular health represents different approaches to achieving the same goal—improved cardiovascular health.



Given the high prevalence of CVD and its morbidity (disease) and mortality (death) consequences, the ability to predict who is at greatest risk for developing CVD is valuable. A
 risk factor
 is an aspect of personal behavior or lifestyle, an environmental exposure, or an inherited characteristic that has been shown by epidemiological evidence to predispose an individual to the development of a specific disease (

Caspersen and Heath, 1993

).
 
Table 15.2

 lists various classifications of risk factors for coronary heart disease. Age, race, sex, and heredity are risk factors that cannot be changed. Age becomes a risk factor for males at 45 years and for females at 55 years. Heredity is interpreted as a family history (parent or sibling) with premature (<55 years of age if male; <65 years of age if female) CVD or death from CVD, especially heart attack or stroke. A family history of coronary revascularization (bypass surgery), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol levels) also increases the risk of coronary heart disease.

 Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors

 An aspect of personal behavior or lifestyle, an environmental exposure, or an inherited characteristic that has been shown by epidemiological evidence to predispose an individual to develop a specific disease.



Cholesterol
 A derived fat that is essential for the body but may be detrimental in excessive amounts.



Lipoprotein
 Water-soluble compound composed of apolipoprotein and lipid components that transport fat in the bloodstream.



Apolipoprotein
 The protein portion of lipoproteins.



Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C)
 A lipoprotein in blood plasma composed of protein, a small portion of triglyceride, and a large portion of cholesterol whose purpose is to transport cholesterol to the cells.



High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL-C)
 A lipoprotein in blood plasma composed primarily of protein and a minimum of cholesterol or triglyceride whose purpose is to transport cholesterol from the tissues to the liver.



Dyslipidemia Triad
 The combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides), low HDL-C, and small, dense LDL-C, which is associated with a much higher risk of CVD than any single factor.





The major modifiable risk factors are, at least to some degree, changeable through diet, exercise, medication, or other lifestyle alterations. These modifiable risk factors correspond closely to the ideal cardiovascular health metrics listed in
 
Table 15.1

. For example,
 
Table 15.1

 indicates that a BMI ≥ 30 kg·m
−2
 (for adults) is defined as a “poor” cardiovascular health metric. This correlates with obesity being a risk factor. Similarly,
 
Table 15.1

 indicates that a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg·dL
−1
 is defined as a “poor” cardiovascular health metric. This corresponds with diabetes mellitus (or prediabetes) being a risk factor for CVD. The following sections discuss the major modifiable risk factors and the role of physical activity or exercise training in modifying each. Each major risk factor acts independently, but many are also interrelated and act jointly. In general, the greater the number of risk factors, the greater the level of risk.




The contributing and nontraditional risk factors are a relatively new set of risk factors that may predict CVD but that are not yet universally considered major risk factors because of a lack of evidence from large-scale studies, because of the infeasibility of measuring these factors in large numbers of people, or because they do not significantly increase the predictability of CVD disease beyond the traditional risk factors. Additional contributing and nontraditional factors, beyond those discussed here, are under study.



Major Modifiable Risk Factors


Cholesterol–Lipid Fractions


Lipids, or fats, are by definition water-insoluble substances. They may be classified as simple (or neutral) fats, compound fats, and derived fats. The primary simple fat is triglyceride. Compound fats are combinations of a neutral fat and another substance such as phosphate (phospholipid), glucose (glucolipid), or protein (lipoprotein). Derived fats originate from simple and compound fats. Chief among them is cholesterol
, a derived fat that is essential for the body but may be detrimental in excessive amounts.



Combining fats with another substance typically makes the compound water soluble, and it is through such compounds—specifically
 lipoproteins
—that fat is transported in the bloodstream. Lipoproteins are so named due to the presence of lipids (triglycerides or free fatty acids and cholesterol) and proteins (
apolipoproteins
) in their structures. Five types of lipoproteins circulate in blood: chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins, intermediate- density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins (

Table 15.3

). As depicted in
 
Figure 15.5

,
 chylomicrons
 are microscopic fat particles that transport dietary sources of triglycerides and cholesterol to the lymphatic system and ultimately to the bloodstream. In the blood, chylomicrons and
 very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
 deliver triglycerides and cholesterol to adipose tissue for storage or to muscle for use as fuel. The removal

 of triglyceride from a VLDL results in an
 intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)
, which in turn is converted in the liver to a
 low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C)
. LDL-C is composed of protein, a small portion of triglyceride, and a large portion of cholesterol. LDL-C transports 60–70% of the total cholesterol in the body to all cells except liver cells. The major apolipoprotein of LDL-C is called Apo-B. As mentioned earlier, LDL-C is involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque.




TABLE 15.3
 Types of Lipoproteins Circulating in the Blood













FIGURE 15.5
 Fat and Cholesterol Transport in the Body.





High-density lipoprotein (HDL-C)
 is a lipoprotein in blood plasma composed primarily of protein and a minimum of cholesterol or triglyceride. The purpose of HDL-C is to transport cholesterol from body tissues to the liver where the cholesterol can be broken down and eliminated in bile. Because HDL-C transports cholesterol, it is abbreviated HDL-C. Some speculate that HDL-C may also block or in some way interfere with the deposition of cholesterol in the arterial wall lining. The major apolipoprotein of HDL-C is called Apo-A1 (

Squires and Williams, 1993

). Because HDL-C transports cholesterol to the liver for elimination, high levels of HDL are good. In fact, high levels are cardioprotective.




Triglycerides (but not the associated VLDLs) represent an independent risk factor (

Summary of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2001

). Chylomicrons are not thought to be atherosclerotic. Abundant evidence shows, however, that an elevated total cholesterol (TC) level is independently and directly related to CHD incidence. A classification system for TC is presented in
 
Table 15.4

 (

Summary of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), 2001

). In the United States, an adult level of 240 mg·dL
−1
 carries twice the risk of a level of 200 mg·dL
−1
. These values thus represent high-risk and desirable levels, respectively. They apply to all adults regardless of age or sex. (The risks in children are considered later.) The term
 hyperlipidemia
 (excessive fat in the blood) is commonly used to describe this risk factor. As seen in
 
Figure 15.4

, less than 50% of American adults (46.6%) have ideal total cholesterol levels (<200 mg·dL
−1
). This ideal cholesterol prevalence has remained largely unchanged over the last decade. Data from 2009 to 2012 show that at least 100 million adults (12.9% of adult population) 20 years of age or older have total cholesterol levels ≥200 mg·dL
−1
 and that nearly 31 million (6.2% of adult population) exceed 240 mg·dL
−1
. Worldwide, total cholesterol levels have declined in high-income regions, although this decline appears to reflect greater statin use, drugs that lower total cholesterol levels, and not changes in dietary patterns (

Mozaffarian et al., 2015

).

 Classification of Total, LDL-C, HDL-C Blood Levels, and Triglycerides

Not only is the total amount of cholesterol important but also the fractions of LDL-C and/or HDL-C are important. High levels of LDL-C and/or Apo-B are positively related to CHD—hence the common term “bad cholesterol.” High levels of HDL-C and/or Apo-A1 are inversely related to CHD—hence the term “good cholesterol.” The optimal level of LDL-C is less than 100 mg·dL
−1
. A low level of HDL-C is less than 40 mg·dL
−1
. An HDL-C level ≥ 60 mg·dL
−1
 is actually so good that it is said to be a negative risk factor, which means it lowers one’s risk for disease (

American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM], 2013

). Some researchers consider decreased Apo-A1 and increased Apo-B to be independent risk factors and believe they add considerably to risk prediction (

Barter et al., 2006

;
 
Sacks, 2006

;
 
Wood and Stefanick, 1990

). However, other researchers have found that these values add little to the predictive value of existing risk factors (

van der Steeg et al., 2007

) while still other authorities are cautious about the ability of any new risk factor to add substantially to the prediction of a chronic medical disease with many contributing causes (

Berkwits and Guallar, 2007

). The combination of hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides), low HDL-C, and small, dense LDL-C is known as the
 dyslipidemia triad

 and is associated with a much higher risk of CVD than any single risk factor (

 Jellinger et al., 2012

).



THE INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE AND EXERCISE TRAINING ON BLOOD LIPIDS The impact of exercise on lipid levels may be both transient (a last-bout effect from a single bout of exercise) and chronic (a consistent adaptation resulting from exercise training). Triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-C all decrease in the 24–48 hours following vigorous aerobic exercise, and HDL-C may increase. Many of these changes appear to require 9–12 months of training to become more or less permanent (Thomas and LaFontaine, 1998
).



Cross-sectional studies in adults have generally shown that active individuals have lipid profiles with a reduced risk for CHD. This result is weak for TC (lower in more active individuals) but strong for HDL-C (higher in more active individuals) and TG (lower in more active individuals). However, there is little, if any, consistent difference in LDL-C levels between active and inactive individuals (

Lippi et al., 2006

). Cross-sectional studies, however, are by their very design difficult to interpret, because the element of self-selection may influence the results. Perhaps individuals who have a good cholesterol profile and healthy lifestyle habits are simply more likely to be active. This problem can be overcome by the use of training studies.




In general, exercise training studies have supported a reduction in TC levels, but often not to statistically significant levels. When present, TC changes are relatively small (3–5%) and short-term (24 hours) unless the energy expenditure is very high. Some individuals may be genetic “nonresponders” whose TC actually rises after exercise. Likewise, LDL-C levels are not consistently reduced significantly as a result of exercise training. On the other hand, the vast majority of studies that last longer than 12 weeks and have a training volume equivalent to at least 15 km·wk
−1
 (9.3 mi·wk
−1
) of running or 1,000–1,200 kcal·wk
−1
 (4,180–5,016 kJ·wk
−1
) of aerobic activity have shown a significant increase in HDL-C levels. Postexercise increases in HDL-C range from 3% to 34% and last from 24 to 72 hours (

Grandjean and Crouse, 2004

). These positive changes in HDL-C with high-intensity training appear to be similar for men and women, independent of age (

Tambalis et al., 2009

).




A high level of energy expenditure is apparently needed to positively alter blood lipids. If the objective is to modify one’s lipid profile, more than 30 minutes of light to moderate activity is needed. A dose-response relationship seems to occur such that more vigorous activity and higher total calorie expenditure result in greater HDL-C increases.
 
Figure 15.6

 presents data on HDL-C and triglycerides based on distance run per week in a group of over 8,000 male recreational runners (

Williams, 1997

). As the figure shows, increased running mileage was associated with a proportional increase in HDL-C levels over most of the range. The lack of a proportional increase in the mean HDL-C value for those running more than 80 km·wk
−1
 (~50 mi·wk
−1
) reflects more on the low number of individuals in that category than does any ceiling effect for HDL-C change. The percentage of individuals with HDL-C values greater than 60 mg·dL
−1
 for each 15 km (~10 miles) category of running per week was 17, 20, 26, 31, 39, and 42, respectively. Remember that at 60 mg·dL
−1
, HDL-C becomes a negative risk factor. A meta-analysis (

Kelley and Kelley, 2006

) has shown consistent increases in HDL-C with aerobic training of at least 8 weeks, independent of decreases in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat. Triglycerides are also consistently reduced (

Wood and Stefanick, 1990

) for up to 44 hours after activity (

Grandjean and Crouse, 2004

). Also, as indicated in
 
Figure 15.6

, TG show a dose-response relationship with greater reductions occurring as mileage run per week increases.

Favorable changes in blood lipids measured after eating are generally seen when aerobic exercise is completed in the period extending from 16 hours before to 1.5 hours after the meal, is of at least moderate intensity, and expends

 at least 500 kcal (2,090 kJ) (

Katsanos, 2006

). Highly trained individuals may need a higher caloric expenditure to elicit HDL-C increases. In addition, to maintain the beneficial effects in lipid variables, the individual must consistently engage in aerobic exercise of sufficient intensity and duration, that is, at least every 3rd day and preferably every 2nd day (

Grandjean and Crouse, 2004

). Note also that both the positive results in lipid profiles and the exercise recommendations pertain only to aerobic activities. Individuals who participate exclusively in anaerobic training programs, including dynamic resistance training, appear to have lipid profiles similar to those of untrained individuals (

Grandjean and Crouse, 2004

;
 
Thomas and LaFontaine, 1998

).



Cigarette Smoking


From 2005 to 2009, more than 480,000 Americans died each year from smoking-related illnesses, nearly one third of those deaths being related to CVD (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). Of course, smoking also increases the risk of cancer and other respiratory diseases. For males, smoking one pack a day doubles the risk compared to not smoking, and smoking more than one pack a day triples the risk. For females, smoking as few as 1–4 cigarettes per day doubles the risk. The longer an individual smokes, the higher the risk (Gordon et al., 2006
). Individuals who currently smoke and those who have quit within the last 6 months are considered to have the same risk (ACSM, 2013
). On average, male smokers die 13.2 years earlier than do nonsmokers, and female smokers 14.5 years earlier (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). Breathing secondhand smoke also increases the risk of heart disease by at least 25% (Gordon et al., 2006
). Cigar and pipe smokers have a higher risk for CVD than do nonsmokers but lower than do cigarette smokers. As seen in Figure 15.4
, the incidence of smoking has decreased over the last decade (i.e., percentage of Americans meeting ideal smoking metric increased). In 2009, just over 20% of American adults smoked cigarettes compared with 18% of Americans in 2013. This represents a decline in smoking of 26% since 1998 (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). However, it also means that over 20% of adults are engaging in an activity that represents a significant risk for CVD as well as lung disease and cancer.



The chemicals in cigarettes, particularly nicotine, stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, causing an acute increase in heart rate and blood pressure, thus making the heart work harder. Carbon monoxide in smoke binds with hemoglobin, thus reducing oxygen transport. The atherosclerotic process is accelerated because smoking injures the arterial wall lining (endothelium); increases the levels of circulating TC, LDL-C, and TG; and decreases the amount of HDL-C.




Smoking also causes blood platelets to adhere to each other, speeds up internal blood clotting, and makes clots that do form tougher to dissolve. Prostacyclin, which is partially responsible for blood vessel dilation, is decreased. Capillaries and small arteries constrict and may spasm shut. Thus, smoking increases the possibility of a thrombus (clot) or an embolism (moving clot) blocking an artery already narrowed by atherosclerosis.




Narrowing of blood vessels to the arms and legs also makes smokers vulnerable to peripheral vascular disease, which may lead to gangrene and amputation. Smokers are 10 times more likely to develop peripheral vascular disease than are nonsmokers (

American Heart Association [AHA], 2007

). Certain life-threatening dysrhythmias of the heartbeat are also more likely to occur. Thus, smoking both operates independently and contributes to other CHD risk factors (

AHA, 2011

;
 
Squires and Williams, 1993

).



THE INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE AND EXERCISE TRAINING ON CIGARETTE SMOKING The relationship between exercise training and smoking is only indirect. One study of over 3,000 individuals showed a consistent and statistically significant inverse relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked and the level of physical activity in both males and females (Dannenberg et al., 1989
). Another study (a random sampling of Peachtree Road Race runners) indicated that 85% of both male and female runners had never smoked. In addition, 81% of the men and 75% of the women who had smoked when they began running had since stopped. Only 1% of the men and 2% of the women who had been nonsmokers started smoking after beginning to run (Koplan et al., 1982
).



Brief bouts of aerobic exercise have been shown to result in an acute reduction in tobacco withdrawal symptoms and cravings to smoke (

Elibero et al., 2011

;
 
Haasova et al., 2013

). Similar results were found with static exercise (pushing one hand against another) performed for a short period of time (

Ussher et al., 2006

). Although these results are encouraging, there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between exercise training and smoking or not. You may know someone who is active or a good athlete who also smokes. Individuals must make a conscious decision to stop smoking. Then it takes 15 years of abstinence for the risk of former smokers to approach that of lifelong nonsmokers (

Hahn et al., 1998

).



Prediabetes and Diabetes Mellitus


Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disease characterized by an inability to use carbohydrates effectively (glucose intolerance). There are four categories of diabetes based on etiology (cause): type 1, type 2, gestational (onset during pregnancy), and other (due to genetic abnormalities, medication, or other illnesses). Only type 1 and type 2 are considered here. Diabetes has become a widespread epidemic in this country, with type 2 diabetes accounting for 90–95% of all cases of diabetes in the United States. Approximately 21.1 million Americans have diagnosed diabetes, and an additional 8.1 million people are undiagnosed (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). The number of diagnosed diabetics in the United States has risen in the last few years. This trend can be seen in Figure 15.4
, which shows a decrease in prevalence of individuals achieving ideal fasting plasma glucose (<100 mg·dL−1
). It is projected that the total prevalence
 of diabetes mellitus will more than double in the United States from 2005 to 2050 (from 5.6% to 12.0% of the population) (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). A substantial percentage of American adults (~35%) have prediabetes (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). People with prediabetes have an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, blindness, and kidney disease.



Type 1 diabetes begins most commonly in childhood and adolescence but is occurring more frequently in older individuals. In type 1 diabetes, an environmentally triggered autoimmune process destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Thus, an external source of insulin must be supplied.




Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease whose diagnosis is often delayed for years. The underlying causes of type 2 diabetes are insulin resistance (an inability to achieve normal rates of glucose uptake in response to insulin) and defective secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells.
 Prediabetes
, also called
 insulin resistance (IR)
, typically precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is characterized by elevations in blood sugar level that get progressively higher until reaching the level of actual diabetes.






Prediabetes
 Blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg·dL−1 confirmed by measurements on at least two separate occasions; also called insulin resistance.





The normal fasting glucose level is less than 100 mg·dL
−1
. Values between 100 and 125 mg·dL
−1
 confirmed by measurements on at least two separate occasions are designated as prediabetes. The threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes is a fasting blood glucose of 126 mg·dL
−1
 (

ACSM, 2013

). Genetic and environmental factors affect the development of type 2 diabetes, but the risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity (predominantly abdominal visceral obesity), and a lack of physical activity (

ACSM and American Diabetes Association, 2010

;
 
Grundy et al., 1999

). Type 2 diabetes used to occur predominantly in adults over the age of 40 years but in recent years has become increasingly prevalent in younger individuals, including children and adolescents.




Early in the progression of type 2 diabetes, insulin may be produced in sufficient or even excessive amounts. Thus, individuals with type 2 diabetes are initially not insulin dependent, but eventually, approximately 40% of these individuals will require insulin injections. Among the many pathological complications resulting from prediabetes and diabetes are an acceleration of atherosclerosis, impaired myocardial contraction, poor peripheral perfusion, and alterations in blood coagulation mechanisms, including increased fibrinogen levels (

Aronson and Rayfield, 2005

).





Figure 15.7

 illustrates the complex interactions between prediabetes/diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk. In the prediabetic state, cells of the body are insulin resistant; thus, the pancreas secretes more insulin in order to facilitate the transfer of glucose into the cell. At this stage, blood glucose levels are slightly elevated, and the damage done to the cardiovascular system is mediated primarily through the negative consequences of hyperinsulinemia (elevated insulin) and insulin resistance. As seen in the large wedge at the bottom of
 
Figure 15.7

, insulin resistance is associated with several negative cardiovascular consequences, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired fibrinolysis (clot breakdown), endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. The pattern of dyslipidemia seen with insulin resistance often includes the disorders that make up the dyslipidemia triad (described earlier) (

 Jellinger et al., 2012

). As the disease progresses, the beta cells of the pancreas become unable to continue secreting elevated insulin, and insulin levels fall. The falling levels of insulin, along with the increasing insulin resistance of cells, means that blood glucose levels rise (the defining characteristic of diabetes). At this stage in the disease, the cardiovascular system is negatively impacted by the high glucose levels (hyperglycemia). As depicted in the top wedge in the diagram, hyperglycemia is also associated with a number of negative cardiovascular consequences, including increased oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability (increased clotting potential). Thus, both hyperglycemia and insulin resistance contribute to increased cardiovascular complications. Importantly,
 
Figure 15.7

 illustrates that the negative cardiovascular consequences associated with insulin resistance can precede the diagnosis of diabetes by many years. In other words, prediabetes is a very serious condition.

THE INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE AND EXERCISE TRAINING ON PREDIABETES AND DIABETES


The evidence is solid and consistent that exercise training is important in both the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and a reduction in the progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. Evidence also consistently shows a reduction of CVD risk in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes as a result of exercise training (Alcazar et al., 2006
; ACSM and American Diabetes Association, 2010
; Sigal et al., 2006
).



One of the acute effects of exercise is an increase in non–insulin-dependent uptake of glucose into the active skeletal muscle. This effect continues after exercise while the depleted stores of glucose (as glycogen) are restored. Studies have shown increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance as a result of exercise training. These changes are transient last-bout or augmented last-bout effects persisting from 12 to 72 hours from a single bout of aerobic exercise. The effect of a dynamic resistance exercise session may last somewhat longer. This means, of course, that a constant pattern of exercise (defined as no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise) must be established to maintain the benefits. The American College of Sports Medicine and American Diabetes Association recommend at least 2.5 hr·wk
−1
 of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Persons with type 2 diabetes should also undertake at least 2.5 hr·wk
−1
 of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity spread out during at least 3 d·wk
−1
. Additionally, individuals with type 2 diabetes should undertake moderate-to-vigorous resistance exercise at least 2–3 d·wk
−1
 (

ACSM and American Diabetes Association, 2010

)

.




Exercise training for individuals with diabetes requires close monitoring and should be done in conjunction with medical personnel. Individuals with diabetes, especially type 1 individuals, often have abnormal blood pressure and other cardiovascular responses to exercise. Insulin injections (the amount used and choice of injection site to avoid working muscles) and carbohydrate ingestion must be carefully adjusted to prevent an exercising diabetic from developing hypoglycemia (

ACSM and American Diabetes Association, 2010

;
 
Colberg, 2001

).







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Understanding Short-Term Inactivity






Endurance training improves glucose tolerance and enhances insulin sensitivity. This means that if a trained individual ingests a given amount of glucose, that glucose is transported into the cells more readily, leaving less glucose in the blood than in an untrained individual. Insulin plays an important role in moving glucose from the blood to the cells by enhancing glucose transporters on the cell membrane (GLUT4 transporters) and possibly by increasing blood flow. The reversibility principle states that when training is discontinued, adaptations are lost. The reversibility of metabolic adaptations can occur quickly; in fact, 7–10 days of detraining reduces glucose tolerance. However, it was not known whether this decrease is attributable to changes in GLUT4 transporters only or whether blood flow is also altered in 7–10 days of detraining. Arciero et al. (1998)
 designed a study to determine whether 7–10 days of detraining (from a highly trained state) resulted in changes in blood flow that were associated with a decline in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.







Arciero and coworkers tested highly trained male endurance athletes on two occasions: when the participants were in a highly trained state and after they refrained from exercise training for a period of 7–10 days (detrained). During the testing period, the athletes ingested a known amount of glucose (75 g) and had blood samples taken for the next 3 hours—this is known as an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood flow was measured in the forearm and calf before and during the OGTT. The accompanying graphs present blood glucose and calf blood flow data obtained in the trained and detrained state. These data reveal the following:






1.
 There was a greater blood glucose response following the ingesting of 75 g of glucose in the detrained state compared to the trained state, despite higher insulin levels. This is consistent with earlier studies that showed that endurance training increases glucose tolerance.




2.
 Calf blood flow was lower at several time points during the OGTT after ingesting the glucose in the detrained state than in the trained state. Pre-OGTT calf blood flow was not different between the two conditions.






These data suggest that blood flow may be an important element in enhancing the ability of muscles to extract glucose from the blood in the trained state. As with most research, this study invites future inquiry, specifically to explore the relationship between blood flow and glucose tolerance in different populations and at different points in a training or detraining program.

Hypertension


Nearly one in every three American adults has hypertension
, or high blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension increases with advancing age, reaching greater than 75% in those over 75 years. Furthermore, prevalence varies widely by race and sex. Black females have the highest prevalence (46.1%), followed closely by black males (44.9%). White males have a slightly higher prevalence (32.9%) than do white females (30.1%) (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). Figure 15.4
 presents the population of individuals (just over 40%) who meet the ideal classification for blood pressure (<120/80 mmHg). In contrast,
 approximately 32.6% of adults are hypertensive. It is projected that approximately 41.1% of adults in the United States will have hypertension in the year 2030, an 8.4% increase from 2012 estimates (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
).



The stages of hypertension are presented in
 
Table 15.5

. These values apply to both sexes and all races throughout the entire adult life span. Note that although the cutoff for diagnosed hypertension is 140/90 mmHg, values between 120/80 and 140/90 mmHg, defined as
 prehypertension
, should signal the beginning of lifestyle modifications. All stages of hypertension are associated with an increased risk of CVD. The higher the stage of hypertension, the higher the risk of CHD and the more aggressive monitoring and treatment should be (

ACSM, 2004

). Hypertension imposes an afterload on the heart, thus increasing ventricular muscle hypertrophy (thickness) and reducing early diastolic filling. Hypertension is a leading factor in endothelial injury and calcium deposition in the coronary arteries, as well as thickening and stiffening of smaller blood vessels. Atherosclerosis occurs in hypertensive individuals two to three times more quickly than in normotensive individuals (

Kannel and Wilson, 1999

;
 
Stewart, 1998

). Hypertension is associated with increased mortality from CVD; 69% of those suffering their first heart attack and 77% of those suffering their first stroke had hypertension (

AHA, 2011

). Hypertension can also cause left ventricular hypertrophy and increases the risk of sudden cardiac death (

Levy et al., 1990

). In patients with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy independently and powerfully predicts morbidity and mortality and is associated with increased risk for heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, stroke, and atrial fibrillation (

Victor, 2012

).

Hypertension
 High blood pressure, defined as adult values equal to or greater than 140/90 mmHg.



Prehypertension
 Designation selected to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension, defined as blood pressure values between 120/80 and 139/89 mmHg.





Ninety to ninety five percent of the cases of hypertension lack a known cause. Such hypertension is called
 primary or essential hypertension
. However, for blood pressure to reach the levels of hypertension, either cardiac output (


) or total peripheral resistance (TPR), or both, must be elevated. The resulting high blood pressure may injure the endothelium and begin the process of atherosclerosis. Further evidence indicates that increased pulse pressure (SBP/DBP) may be an independent predictor of CVD disease morbidity and mortality (

ACSM, 2004

).



THE INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE AND EXERCISE TRAINING ON HYPERTENSION Research strongly demonstrates the role of exercise training in the primary prevention, treatment, and control of moderate hypertension. Individuals at high risk for developing hypertension—because of genetics, body composition, primary disease status, or an exaggerated blood pressure response to acute exercise—can reduce their risk through an endurance training program. Longitudinal studies show that high levels of both physical activity and physical fitness are associated with decreased risk of developing hypertension (ACSM, 2004
). Dynamic aerobic training reduces resting blood pressure in both individuals with normal or hypertensive values. The decrease is higher in hypertensive individuals (6–7 mmHg systolic/5–6 mmHg diastolic) than in normotensive individuals (2–3 mmHg systolic/1–2 mmHg diastolic).



Most studies have found that blood pressure responds quickly to exercise training. Blood pressure decreases within 3 weeks to 3 months after training starts, often does not become fully normalized, and does not decrease further with continued training. Decreased total peripheral resistance (TPR) appears to be the primary mechanism for the reduction in blood pressure with exercise training (

ACSM, 2004

). If the training is stopped, the resting blood pressure returns to the elevated level. At least part of the reduction in blood pressure may be a function of each individual exercise session rather than a permanent training adaptation, for even a single session of submaximal exercise reduces blood pressure for 1–22 hours postexercise (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Hagberg, 1990

). That is, blood pressure exhibits a last-bout and a chronic adaptation to training (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Hagberg, 1990

). The decrease in blood pressure following an acute bout of exercise is termed
 postexercise hypotension (PEH)
. It occurs in both normotensive and hypertensive males and females of all ages and races, with the greatest reductions again occurring in those with hypertension (

ACSM, 2004

).




Dynamic aerobic endurance exercise training can also benefit individuals with severe or very severe hypertension. In this case, however, pharmacological therapy should be initiated first and the exercise program then added. Such sequencing leads to a further reduction in blood pressure and ultimately a decreased reliance on antihypertensive medication (

Hagberg, 1990

;
 
Simons-Morton, 1999

)

.




The pressor response accompanying dynamic resistance training has always been of great concern, and individuals with hypertension have historically been discouraged from doing weight lifting. Studies on resistance exercise, however, have failed to substantiate an adverse effect on blood pressure. Dynamic resistance training reduces blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive individuals chronically by approximately 3 mmHg for both systolic and diastolic pressure. However, the limited evidence suggests that it has no postexercise hypotensive affect. Limited evidence also suggests that static exercise reduces blood pressure in adults with elevated blood pressures (

ACSM, 2004

). Therefore, although the cardiovascular changes elicited by endurance training are more desirable than are those from resistance training, dynamic resistance training can be done by hypertensive individuals as part of a comprehensive training program. Strength training should not be the only exercise program, however, and it is most effective if it is added after 2 or 3 months of typical aerobic endurance training.




The following exercise prescription is recommended for individuals with hypertension:




Type:
 primarily aerobic endurance exercise supplemented with dynamic resistance exercise



Frequency:
 most, if not all, days of the week


Intensity: moderate; for adults; this should equal 40–59% HRR or 





Duration:
 30–60 minutes, either performed continuously or accumulated in 10-minute bouts (ACSM, 2004
)


Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome


Obesity is now a common feature of American society. Figure 15.4
 reveals that in 2012 only 31% of US adults were considered normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg·m−2
), which equates to having an ideal cardiovascular health metric for BMI (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). In contrast, 35% of US adults were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg·m−2
), which is defined as a “poor” cardiovascular health metric. Although there have been several years when the prevalence of obesity remained unchanged, the prevalence of obesity is projected to increase and reach 51% by the year 2030. A BMI of greater than 30 kg·m−2
 and a waist girth greater than 102 cm (40 in.) for males and greater than 88 cm (35 in.) for females, are field measures to determine obesity as a risk factor for disease (ACSM, 2013
). Body composition measures are fully discussed in this text in Chapter 7
.



The relationship between obesity and CVD is both independent of and interrelated to the other cardiovascular risk factors in a disease process known as the metabolic syndrome (

Gordon, 1998

;
 
Kannel and Wilson, 1999

;
 
Welk and Blair, 2000

). The
 metabolic syndrome
 is a cluster of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin that directly promotes the development of atherosclerotic CVD and increases the individual’s risk of diabetes. The predominant underlying risk factors for the metabolic syndrome appear to be abdominal obesity (high amounts of upper body visceral fat) and insulin resistance (

Grundy, 2007

). Under the stimulation of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, visceral abdominal adipocytes readily release free fatty acids (FFA) into the circulation. Free fatty acids have two possible fates: (1) they may be transported to the liver, where they are converted to VLDL and ultimately LDL cholesterol; or (2) they may be taken up by other cells, including skeletal muscle cells, and oxidized to provide ATP energy by cellular respiration. This enhancement of lipid oxidation may lead to a reduced use of glucose as fuel. At the same time, the increased FFA levels act directly in the liver to inhibit insulin clearance, resulting in hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia combined with high levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) leads to a reduction in insulin sensitivity. The combination of high glucose and hyperinsulinemia can hasten the development of CVD (see
 
Figure 15.7

). Hyperinsulinemia also increases sodium retention and in susceptible salt-sensitive individuals may precipitate hypertension. Thus, high visceral abdominal obesity is directly related to dyslipidemia (low HDL-C and high triglycerides), reduced glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertension, and inflammation, which together form the cluster of risk factors for CVD known as the metabolic syndrome (

Balagopal et al., 2011

;
 
Buemann and Tremblay, 1996

;
 
Gordon, 1998

;
 
Kannel and Wilson, 1999

;
 
Welk and Blair, 2000

). Although there is no absolute standard diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome, the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel’s definition includes the presence of any three of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity defined as a waist circumference of greater than 102 cm for males and greater than 88 cm for females, (2) plasma TG ≥ 150 mg·dL
−1
, (3) HDL-C < 40 mg·dL
−1
 in males and < 50 mg·dL
−1
 for females, (4) BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg, and (5) fasting glucose ≥ 110 mg·dL
−1
 (

AHA, 2002

). Treatment of the “syndrome” is no different from treatment for each of its individual components. However, at the very least, the concept of a syndrome may help the individual realize that all risk factors need to be identified and treated simultaneously (

Marks, 2006

;
 
Venkat Narayan, 2006

).

The Impact of a Change in Physical Fitness on Cardiovascular Disease Mortality






This chapter describes the inverse relationship between physical activity and mortality from coronary heart disease and the positive impacts of exercise training on each cardiovascular disease risk factor. The cited studies relating physical activity or physical fitness to mortality, however, generally used only a single baseline evaluation of activity or fitness with subsequent follow-up to determine the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes. Although extremely important, these results could have been influenced both by genetics and by changes in risk factor status between the baseline testing and time of death. Conversely, the studies of exercise training had both pretraining and posttraining evaluations but did not examine the overall impact on cardiovascular mortality. From a public health, exercise professional, and personal perspective, the overall goal of exercise training is to enhance both the quality and quantity of life. It is important to determine whether improving and maintaining physical fitness can attain these goals. Therefore, a linkage between the two types of studies is important.








Blair et al. (1995)

 studied the mortality and relative risk of death ratios from cardiovascular disease of 9,777 males who had at least two complete examinations at the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research between 1970 and 1989. The average interval between the two testing sessions was 4.0 ± 4.1 years, and the average follow-up for mortality was 5.1 ± 4.2 years, but the range was 1–18 years for both. Treadmill time to volitional fatigue, converted to maximal oxygen uptake, was the measure of cardiovascular physical fitness. Individuals whose results fell into the bottom quintile (lowest 20%) based on age-adjusted results were labeled unfit. The unfit group had the following
 

 values for each age group:





<35.0 mL·kg−1
·min−1
, 20–39 years


<32.2 mL·kg−1
·min−1
, 40–49 years


<29.4 mL·kg−1
·min−1
, 50–59 years


<24.5 mL·kg−1
·min−1
, 60+ years





All individuals in quintiles (Q) 2, 3, 4, and 5 were labeled fit. Men who were unfit at both testing times had the highest death rate from CVD; men who were fit at both testing times had the lowest death rate; and men who changed fitness status between testing sessions had intermediate death rates, as shown in panel A of the accompanying graph. Although the values for the men who changed fitness status appear to be similar, these must be interpreted relative to the direction of the change. The unfit men who moved out of the lowest quintile died at a rate less than half that of those who remained unfit, whereas those who moved from fit to unfit had an increased death rate of approximately 25%. When changes in status occurred among the four upper quartiles, a dose-response relationship was seen. A low mortality rate was evident in men who remained in quintiles 2 and 3; a lower mortality rate was seen in men who moved from quintiles 2 and 3 to 4 and 5; and the lowest mortality rate was seen in men in the upper two quintiles (4 and 5) who remained there.








The comparable results in terms of relative risk are shown in panel B of the graph. The unfit men who moved into the fit category reduced their risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 52% (relative risk = 0.48). After adjustment for potential confounders, each minute of increase in treadmill time (equivalent to
 

 increase of only 1.75 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 in the protocol used) was associated with a reduced risk of 8.6% for CVD mortality. Those who changed from fit to unfit had a risk less than half that of the consistently unfit, but almost twice that of those who remained fit.








A follow-up analysis of these data (

Kampert, 2004

) confirmed that mortality risk was inversely related to change in fitness after correction for measurement error and adjustment for initial CVD, fitness level, age, health status, and exam year.








The message is clear. Individuals who are unfit must be encouraged and helped to attain at least a minimal level of fitness. This minimal level can be achieved by engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5 days of the week or vigorous activity 3 days per week in bouts of at least 10 minutes (

Haskell et al., 2007

). Individuals who are already fit must be equally encouraged and helped to maintain or improve their level of fitness. Although Blair and his colleagues’ results were compiled only on males (because of an insufficient number of female subjects),
 
Manson et al. (1999)

 have reported similar findings from the Nurses’ Health Study, which followed 72,488 women 40–65 years of age.








It is never too late to try to become fit; it is never too soon to make a lifetime commitment to activity and fitness.

THE INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE TRAINING ON OBESITY AND THE METABOLIC SYNDROME Exercise training, or fitness level, has a large influence on obesity, metabolic syndrome, and CVD. Figure 15.8
 presents a study showing the relative risk of CVD mortality (adjusted for age, exam year, smoking, alcohol intake, and heredity) by percent body fat (lean, normal, obese) and cardiorespiratory fitness (fit, unfit) in males (Lee et al., 1999
). Relative risk indicates how much more likely a group of individuals with the risk factor are to develop the outcome. A value of 1.0 is the baseline for the group without the risk factor; in this case, 1.0 represents lean fit males. Statistically significant numbers higher than 1.0 mean that individuals with that risk factor have a higher “relative risk” of dying from CVD. For example, a relative risk of 3.16 (as for the unfit, lean group) means that these individuals are 316% more likely to die of CVD than individuals in the fit, lean group! Importantly, unfit, lean males had a higher risk of CVD mortality than did fit males in all body fat categories. Unfit obese males had the highest relative risk (4.11). Fit obese males had a lower risk of CVD mortality than did unfit, lean men.

The effect of exercise training on visceral and total body obesity is detailed in the metabolic unit of this text. The effect of exercise training on each of the other risk factors in the cluster of metabolic syndrome is described in the appropriate sections of this chapter. A sedentary lifestyle, poor cardiovascular fitness (

Lakka et al., 2003

;
 
Mileski et al., 2015

), and poor muscular strength (

 Jurca et al., 2005

;
 
Magyari and Churilla, 2012

) have all been shown to be associated with the metabolic syndrome. Regular physical activity can improve the metabolic risk profile and reduce the risk of CVD.





Figure 15.9

 presents the results of 20 weeks of aerobic training on men and women with the metabolic syndrome. As the figure shows, significant improvements occurred in all risk factors but HDL-C (which often requires more vigorous exercise to change). The overall result was that 30.5% of the participants classified as having metabolic syndrome at the beginning of the exercise training were no longer classified this way at the end of the training (

Katzmarzyk et al., 2003

). Research continues to identify the optimal training program to improve cardiovascular risk associated with the metabolic syndrome (

Churilla et al., 2012

;
 
Ciolac et al., 2010

;
 
Pattyn et al., 2013

;
 
Stensvold et al., 2010

;
 
Strasser et al., 2010

). Cardiorespiratory training reduces several metabolic syndrome risk factors. The magnitude of the effect of exercise on risk factors varies based on the training program employed and may not be consistent among risk factors (

ACSM, 2011

).

A significant dose-response relationship has been observed between cardiorespiratory fitness and mortality in males with metabolic syndrome. In one study of 3,757 men with metabolic syndrome, men in the middle and lower tertiles of cardiorespiratory fitness had 2.08 and 3.48 times the risk of CVD mortality than did the men in the upper tertile of CVD fitness (

Katzmarzyk et al., 2004

)

 . Another study categorized men into low (lowest 20%), moderate (middle 40%), and high (highest 40%) cardiorespiratory fitness based on age and treadmill test results. For any given level of waist circumference, visceral fat, or subcutaneous fat, the high-fitness group had lower TG levels and higher HDL-C than did either the moderate- or low-fitness groups. The relative risks of having the metabolic syndrome were 1.8 and 1.6 times higher in the low- and moderate-fitness groups than in the high-fitness group after adjusting for age, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat (

Lee et al., 2005

).




In general, physical activity, exercise training, and cardiovascular-respiratory fitness bring about beneficial changes that limit the progression of metabolic syndrome, with or without changes in total body weight and composition (

Buemann and Tremblay, 1996

;
 
Carroll and Dudfield, 2004

;
 
Welk and Blair, 2000

).



Physical Inactivity


In the last decade, emphasis has shifted from the product of physical fitness (typically defined as cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by 

) to the behavior of physical activity to achieve health benefits. There is, of course, evidence that both physical fitness
 and physical activity
 lead to health benefits and decreased negative health outcomes. The physical activity and public health recommendations (ACSM, 2011
; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008
) suggest that adults from 18 to 65 years participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity 5 days of the week (for a total of 150 minutes) or vigorous aerobic activity for 20–60 minutes 3 d·wk−1
 (for a total of 75 minutes). These guidelines also point out that additional health benefits accrue as activity levels increase. Such activities must be in addition to routine activities of daily living that are of light intensity such as casual walking or grocery shopping. However, moderate or vigorous activities performed as part of daily life such as brisk walking or heavy manual labor can be counted toward the activity recommendations. In addition, muscle strengthening activity consisting of 8–10 exercises involving the major muscle groups for 8–12 repetitions, 2–3 d·wk−1
 should be included. Individuals not participating in a regular exercise program or not meeting these minimal physical activity guidelines are considered to have the risk factor of a sedentary lifestyle (ACSM, 2011
). It was thought that it would be easier to motivate the public to accumulate lifestyle moderate activity than to undergo the regimented vigorous exercise usually prescribed for physical fitness enhancement. Therefore the risk factor for CVD is labeled physical inactivity
 rather than lack of physical fitness
. As seen in Figure 15.4
, only approximately 45% of individuals meet the criteria for an ideal cardiovascular health metric for physical activity (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). Figure 15.10
 documents the prevalence of individuals who meet physical activity guidelines among men and women of different ethnic backgrounds. Unfortunately the data indicate that a relatively small percentage (~35–57%) of the population is meeting current guidelines for physical activity. Furthermore, within each ethnic group, women are less likely to meet current guidelines than are men.

Figure 15.11

 presents findings from a single study investigating cardiovascular risk reduction based on total physical activity. In this study, the third quintile (Q3) represents the level of activity then recommended in the Surgeon General’s Report (

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996

), that is, the equivalent of walking briskly for 30 min·d
−1
, 5 d·wk
−1
. Note that the baseline relative risk of 1.0 represents the relative risk of those with no physical activity (Q1) and that relative

 risk values less than 1.0 represent a lower risk with more activity. Participants in this study were postmenopausal females. As the figure shows, women with the recommended level of activity had a 19% lower risk for CVD than did those who engaged in no physical activity. Those who engaged in higher amounts of activity had even more reduction in risk, 22% and 28% in Q4 and Q5, respectively. Those with less than the recommended level of total activity had no significant benefit. Results were similar whether the women were normal weight, overweight, or obese and whether their race was black or white (

Manson et al., 2002

).

Figure 15.12

 is a composite graph of the effects of
 physical activity
 and
 physical fitness
 on relative risk of heart disease based on a meta-analysis of eight studies of physical fitness and 30 studies of physical activity. This graph reveals that (a) the relative risk of CHD/CVD decreases linearly with increasing amounts of physical activity; (b) the risks of CHD/CVD drop precipitously before the 25th percentile of physical fitness and then parallel the slope of the decline in physical activity; and (c) a significant difference in risk reduction is associated with being more physically fit than physically active (

Williams, 2001

). The author suggested that this might indicate that lack of physical fitness and physical inactivity are separate, distinct risk factors for CVD and that both physical fitness and physical activity should be measured and interventions followed if warranted. One of the issues is that physical fitness can be measured more accurately than physical activity, and this could at least partially explain the results. Whether the difference in risk reduction between physical fitness and physical activity is true or a measurement artifact needs more study. It is clear, however, that at least moderate physical activity should be undertaken by all, but that the attainment of physical fitness is certainly not to be discouraged once individuals have achieved the minimal level of physical activity (

Plowman, 2005

). Current recommendations explicitly encourage vigorous physical activity for those who are willing and able to do it (

ACSM, 2011

).

The degree of risk for those who are physically inactive, about twice that of those without this risk factor, is approximately the same as the risk associated with systolic hypertension, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia. As has been discussed in the sections for each of these other risk factors, physical activity positively impacts the risk from these as well. Given the high prevalence of physical inactivity and the benefits derived from becoming more physically active, potentially more benefit overall could be achieved by increasing the activity level of US citizens than by changing any other single risk factor (

AHA, 2007

;
 
Caspersen and Heath, 1993

;
 
Froelicher, 1990

). One of the most important facts about activity or exercise training is that the greatest health benefits occur when very sedentary individuals increase their endurance activity levels even minimally (

Blair and Minocha, 1989

).




The mechanisms by which physical activity achieves its protective effect are many and varied. Some are independent and a direct result of the adaptive changes that occur in the cardiovascular system and its neural control, as were documented earlier in this unit. For example, the increases in parasympathetic tone and decreases in sympathetic response reduce the resting and exercise heart rate in physically active individuals and possibly influence hypertension. These changes also enhance the electrical stability of the myocardial cells, reducing the risk of potentially fatal conduction system defects and coronary vessel spasms. Other indirect mechanisms are linked to the different risk factors (

Caspersen and Heath, 1993

). Obviously, participating in physical activity directly eliminates physical inactivity as a risk factor. The impact of physical activity or exercise training on all of the major modifiable risk factors is summarized in
 
Table 15.6

.

Recently, additional studies have raised the probability that excessive sedentary behavior also has implications for health and that too much sedentary behavior is distinct from too little exercise or too little physical activity.
 Sedentary behavior
 is defined as any waking behavior that expends ≤ 1.5 METs of energy often, but not always, stipulated as being in a reclining or sitting posture (

Gibbs et al., 2015

). For example, prolonged sitting time in transit (driving/riding in a car), at work (computer/desk tasks), at home, and in leisure time (television watching/computer activities). Observational epidemiological studies strongly suggest that excessive daily sitting time, limited standing, infrequent getting up and down from a chair, and/or minimal incidental walking may have a significant direct relationship to mortality, CVD, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, depression, increased waist circumference, hypertension, depressed lipoprotein lipase activity, blood glucose, insulin, and lipoproteins. A 2013 meta-analysis (

Chau et al., 2013

) found a dose-response relationship

 between hours of sitting and the risk of all-cause mortality. There was a 52% higher mortality risk for adults sitting ≥10 hr·d
−1
 when physical activity was not taken into

 account and a 34% higher mortality risk after taking moderate-to-vigorous physical activity into account. Some previous studies had found that meeting physical activity guidelines was not sufficient to counteract the effects of excessive sitting (

Katzmarzyk et al., 2009

;
 
Owen et al., 2009

,
 
2010

). This meta-analysis, however, suggests that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity had a partially protective effect especially when sitting time was high. As always, for public health purposes, it is important to determine what level of exercise/activity is needed to counteract sitting inactivity. Note that standing, although at a MET level below 1.5, is not specified in the definition of sedentary behavior. Indeed, standing has been proposed as a feasible and promising strategy to reduce sitting time and hence risk. Recent studies on large numbers of both Canadian and Australian adults have found that greater time spent standing was associated with a lower risk of mortality, especially in those who were physically inactive (

Katzmarzyk, 2014

;
 
van der Ploeg et al., 2014

). A study of older Americans found that in less active individuals (<2 hr·d
−1
) replacing 1 hr·d
−1
 of sitting with an equal amount of either purposeful exercise or nonexercise activities (e.g., household chores, lawn and garden work, shopping) was associated with lower all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. For more active individuals (>2 hr·d
−1
) replacement of sitting time with purposeful activity, but not nonexercise activity, was associated with lower mortality (

Matthews et al., 2015

). Thus, the baseline activity status of the individual appears to be critical in determining whether purposeful or nonexercise physical activity is needed to reduce the adverse biological effects of excessive sitting. Common sense suggests that it is prudent to try to minimize prolonged sitting with 5-minute breaks every hour to walk around, stretch, or do some activity of daily living (

ACSM, 2011

). If you have been diligently sitting and studying for at least an hour, it is time for you to take such a short break.

Influence of Physical Activity on Mortality in Elderly with Coronary Artery Disease






This chapter describes the inverse relationship between physical activity and mortality from coronary heart disease and the positive impact of exercise training
 on each cardiovascular disease risk factor. The following study specifically investigated the dose-response relationship between physical activity and the relative risk of mortality in patients with coronary artery disease in an observational cohort study.








Janssen and Jolliffe (2006)

 studied the dose-response relationship between baseline physical activity level and all-cause mortality risk over a 9-year period in 1,045 men and women with coronary artery disease. Participants were stratified based on sex, age, smoking, adiposity, self-perceived health, number of risk factors, and coronary artery disease subtype so that the relationship between physical activity and mortality could be examined within each strata. Participants returned for a 3-year follow-up examination. A separate analysis was performed on a subset of participants (
n
 = 785) who had changed their physical activity level (from baseline to the 3-year follow-up) to determine the relationship between changes in physical activity over the initial 3-year follow-up and mortality risk over the subsequent 6-year period.








The dose-response curve shown in panel A depicts the relationship between energy expenditure and relative risk of mortality for the entire group. The data are adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status, adiposity, prevalent disease, and type of coronary artery disease. As seen in other studies, the relative risk of mortality decreased with increasing levels of activity (expressed as energy expenditure). The data were then examined by strata. Independent of age, sex, smoking, adiposity, self-perceived health status, number of risk factors, or type of coronary artery disease, the relative risks of mortality were significantly lower in the active participants (>1,500 kcal·wk
−1
) compared to inactive participants (<1,500 kcal·wk
−1
). However, even those individuals who accumulated only approximately 1,000 kcal·wk
−1
 had a 19% reduction in mortality risk, again showing that some exercise is always better than no exercise.








The dose-response curve shown in panel B depicts the relationship between change in energy expenditure (from baseline to the 3-year follow-up) and relative risk of mortality at the study completion (9 years). Again, the data are adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status, adiposity, prevalent disease, and type of coronary artery disease. Clearly, the risk of mortality was higher for individuals whose physical activity level decreased and lower for those whose physical activity level increased.








The practical implications of this study are immense. This study reinforces the common finding of an inverse relationship between physical activity and mortality risk and clearly demonstrates that in patients with coronary artery disease, regardless of age, sex, severity of disease, or other risk factors, there is a protective benefit to higher levels of physical activity. Finally, in a group of patients with coronary artery disease, an increase in physical activity level was associated with reduction in mortality risk. The bottom line is that physical inactivity increased mortality risk in study participants regardless of whether they were men or women, old or very old, smokers or nonsmokers, lean or overweight, or otherwise healthy or unhealthy. The take-home message is that physical activity should be encouraged for the vast majority of people, including coronary artery disease patients.

Contributing and Selected Nontraditional Risk Factors


C-Reactive Protein


C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of systemic inflammation, tissue damage, and infection. Prospective studies have repeatedly shown that CRP independently predicts heart attacks, stroke, and sudden cardiac death in apparently healthy men and women (Ridker and Libby, 2005
). Importantly, CRP adds predictive value to traditional risk factors. Figure 15.13
 shows the relative risk of future heart attack associated with selected traditional and nontraditional risk factors in initially healthy middle-aged men and women. As discussed earlier, elevated total cholesterol (TC) is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. The mean relative risk in the highest quartile of individuals compared to the lowest quartile for TC was approximately 2.0, representing a 200% increase in the risk of heart attack in those with the highest TC. The predictive value was even greater when individuals in the highest quartile of TC:HDL-C ratio were compared to the lowest quartile. Elevated Apo-B (discussed in the lipid section) is also associated with an increased relative risk for a heart attack. Of particular significance is the dramatic increase in risk associated with the highest quartile of CRP (relative risk = 4.0). Furthermore, when
 CRP and the TC:HDL-C ratio are both elevated, the combined risk is even greater (relative risk = 6.0). CRP has also been shown to predict recurrent coronary events, poor outcomes associated with angina, and vascular complications after bypass surgery (Ridker and Libby, 2005
).

Inflammation plays a central role in atherosclerotic plaque development and in plaque rupture. As described previously, the early phase of atherosclerosis is characterized by an inflammatory response in the arterial wall. Research suggests that plaque rupture, leading to clot formation, is also associated with inflammation. A study using autopsy data found that individuals who suffered a plaque rupture had a higher CRP than did those who died of nonvascular causes (

Burke et al., 2002

).




An acute bout of prolonged, strenuous aerobic exercise leads to an elevation in CRP that is evident 6 hours postexercise and appears to peak around 24 hours postexercise (

Mooren et al., 2006

;
 
Sorichter et al., 2006

). However, regular endurance training is associated with reduced levels of CRP.
 
Figure 15.14

 presents data in which CRP levels are reported based on fitness quartile. An inverse relationship between CRP levels and fitness quartile was present for both men and women. Furthermore, this inverse relationship was independent of other factors that influence CRP, including smoking, adiposity, and hormone replacement therapy (

Aronson et al., 2004

). A reduction in CRP levels is associated with chronic physical activity (

Kasapis and Thompson, 2005

). However, the mechanisms for this reduction are not clear. One study has found that exercise without weight loss does not reduce CRP (

Church et al., 2010

), thus suggesting that weight loss along with regular exercise may be an important factor in inflammatory levels.

Fibrinogen/Coagulation


As described at the beginning of this chapter, one of the major dangers of atherosclerotic plaque is that plaque rupture would lead to clot formation that could block an already narrowed blood vessel. Fibrinogen is a protein present in blood plasma that, under certain physiological circumstances, is converted into fibrin threads that form the basis of a blood clot. In addition, fibrinogen increases blood platelet aggregation and blood viscosity. Thus, fibrinogen is a thrombotic marker. High levels of fibrinogen increase the likelihood of internal clot formation. Fibrinogen levels are positively related to age, obesity, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and LDL-C and inversely related to HDL-C, alcohol use, physical activity, and exercise level (Margaglione et al., 1998
; Wu, 1997
). Much of the relationship between smoking and CHD and some of the association between psychological stress and CHD may be mediated through plasma fibrinogen levels. Prospective studies suggest that individuals with fibrinogen levels in the highest quartile have approximately twice the risk of CHD as those in the lowest quartile (Woo and Magliano, 2003
).



It is unclear what effect a single bout of exercise has on fibrinogen levels, as various studies have reported increases, decreases, or no effect. Furthermore, evidence in the literature is conflicting about the effect of exercise training on fibrinogen levels. However, most well-designed studies suggest that aerobic training does not affect fibrinogen levels in healthy individuals or those with cardiovascular risk factors (

El-Sayed et al., 2000

;
 
Womack et al., 2003

).




While fibrinogen levels do not consistently change as a result of exercise or exercise training, other measures of blood coagulability do in fact change. A single acute

 bout of exercise is associated with increased coagulatory potential (potential for forming a clot). The magnitude of this change appears to be heavily influenced by exercise intensity (

Hegde et al., 2001

). Aerobic exercise training is associated with decreased platelet aggregation and a decrease in some clotting factors, suggesting that coagulatory potential may be decreased following an aerobic training program (

Womack et al., 2003

).



Fibrinolytic Activity


Fibrinolytic activity refers to the breakdown of fibrin clots. Enhanced fibrinolytic activity can reduce the risk of clots and thus the risk of CHD. Conversely, an inhibition of fibrinolysis increases the risk of arterial thrombosis. Prospective studies have reported that elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a protein that inhibits fibrinolytic activity, are associated with increased risk of initial and recurrent myocardial infarction (Meade, 1995
). Visceral abdominal obesity leads to increased PAI-1 production from adipocytes and thus is directly related to reduced fibrinolytic activity (Ridker and Libby, 2005
).



A single bout of aerobic exercise (but not static exertion) has consistently been shown to increase fibrinolytic activity (

Drygas, 1988

;
 
Womack et al., 2003

). The change is greater in active than in sedentary individuals, and high-intensity exercise produces more change than does moderate-intensity exercise.




Importantly, it appears that both coagulatory and fibrinolytic potential increase following exercise (

Hegde et al., 2001

;
 
Menzel and Hilberg, 2009

). However, they do not remain elevated for the same time period. There is evidence that coagulatory potential remains elevated for at least 60 minutes, whereas fibrinolytic activity quickly returns to normal values (

Hegde et al., 2001

). This may create an imbalance that favors clot formation in the postexercise period. Fibrinolytic potential is improved with aerobic exercise training in both healthy individuals and those with risk factors for CVD (

Buemann and Tremblay, 1996

;
 
Carroll et al., 2000

;
 
El-Sayed et al., 2000

;
 
Szymanski and Pate, 1994

;
 
Szymanski et al., 1994

;
 
Womack et al., 2003

;
 
Wood and Stefanick, 1990

).



Stress


Stress (see Chapters 1
 and 21
) is probably the most controversial of the CHD risk factors. Many factors affect how stress impacts an individual, and these factors are difficult to identify and measure. How much stress any given stressor causes depends not just on the stressor but also on characteristics of the individual. For example, what vulnerabilities or, conversely, what coping strategies does the individual have?



The response to the stressor varies according to the individual’s psychological and physiological level of reactivity (

Childs et al., 2014

). For example, among the acute physiological responses to fear or anger, mediated through the neural and hormonal systems, are increases in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and blood viscosity and decreases in clotting time and the breakdown of fats used as a fuel. In the short term, these responses (often called “fight or flight responses”), if appropriate to the level of need, are good. That is, from an evolutionary perspective, the individual might have to fight (and, if wounded, would need to clot blood quickly to prevent too great a loss of blood) or flee (and have sufficient energy and oxygen-carrying capacity to do so). However, if they are excessive or become chronic, these responses form a possible mechanism for the development of hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombogenesis, and clinical heart disease.




The consequences of both the stressor and the response to the stressor can also vary, from extremely positive and health-enhancing effects to illness or injury or, ultimately, death. For example, adaptation to exercise training for an improved fitness level can enhance health. Conversely, as has been documented in several cases, bad news can precipitate sudden death from a heart attack in susceptible individuals (

Caspersen and Heath, 1993

;
 
Landers, 1994

;
 
Plowman, 1994

).




The type of stress primarily implicated in CVD is psychosocial or emotional stress rather than physical stress (

Holmes et al., 2006

). Although life events, daily hassles, and occupational stresses, among other factors, have been considered in studies of stress, emphasis was originally placed on behavioral patterns known as type A and type B. The type A behavior pattern (TABP) is characterized by hard-driving competitiveness; time urgency, haste, and impatience; a workaholic lifestyle; and hostility. The type B behavior pattern (TBBP) is characterized by relaxation without guilt and less time urgency.




Research in the 1970s showed a positive relationship between TABP and CHD. Research in the 1980s and 1990s, however, seemed to pinpoint only the hostility component. As a psychological concept, hostility includes cynicism, anger, mistrust, and aggression and is frequently associated with situations of “high demand and low control.” Without hostility, the other type A personality traits are now thought to be relatively benign (

Landers, 1994

;
 
Plowman, 1994

). With hostility, specifically measured as anger, there is a significant association with a propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress (

Pimple et al., 2015

). Recently, a new personality behavior pattern, type D, has been investigated. Type D is characterized by the joint tendencies to experience negative emotions (negative affectivity) and to inhibit these emotions while avoiding social contact with others (social inhibition). Type D individuals (particularly males) have been observed to have maladaptive cardiovascular responses to stress, an increased risk for CVD morbidity and mortality (

Bibbey et al., 2015

;
 
Howard and Huges, 2013

;
 
Sher, 2005

). Stress may have a direct impact through neurohormonal changes (especially in catecholamine and serotonin levels) or an indirect effect through the use of unhealthy coping strategies, such as overeating, smoking, or excessive alcohol intake (

Gordon, 1998

;
 
Habra et al., 2003

).




Three studies have investigated the impact of exercise training on TABP, but none of them isolated the component of hostility. Two of the three did show, however, a decrease in TABP with dynamic endurance exercise

 training. These studies involved both higher-intensity and longer-duration exercise than did the study that showed no significant response (

Landers, 1994

). In a randomized controlled trial that incorporated 16 weeks of aerobic exercise training and stress management in addition to routine medical care in patients with heart disease, those who received the additional treatment experienced reduced emotional distress and had improved markers of cardiovascular risk more than did those who received only the usual medical care (

Blumenthal et al., 2005

). An acute bout of exercise is well established as an effective stress management technique (

Berger, 1994

).





Children and the Cardiovascular Risk Factors




The concern about CVD risk factors in children is not that children exhibit clinical CVD but that atherosclerotic CVD is a lifelong process that begins in childhood. Therefore, if risk factors can be prevented, modified, or counteracted in childhood, it may be possible to prevent or at least delay or reduce the severity of cardiovascular problems in adulthood.



In relation to physical activity, the intent is to establish patterns of participation in children that will continue throughout adulthood. To a large extent, the success of this strategy depends on a phenomenon called tracking. In this context,
 tracking
 means that a characteristic is maintained, in terms of relative rank, over a long time span or even a lifetime. An example of tracking a nonrisk factor is height. Children in the upper percentiles of height at a very young age tend to maintain that relative position and be taller than average adults. Thus, in relation to children, it is important to determine the presence or absence of modifiable risk factors, the tracking strength of risk factors, and the impact of physical activity and exercise training on both short-term risk factor reductions and long-term lifestyle modifications (

Rowland, 1991

;
 
Rowland and Freedson, 1994

).

Cholesterol-Lipid Fractions


At birth, total cholesterol levels are approximately 70 mg·dL−1
, with 35 mg·dL−1
 of that total being HDL. During the first few weeks, the level of TC rises rapidly to between 100 and 150 mg·dL−1
. By 2 years and until adulthood, the average value for males is about 160 mg·dL−1
 and for females about 165 mg·dL−1
, with HDL-C levels between 50 and 55 mg·dL−1
. At puberty, males show a decline of HDL-C and females a decline in LDL-C values. In general, cholesterol levels do track from childhood to adulthood, although not all children with high juvenile levels of cholesterol will have elevated adult levels. In one study, 43% of children with cholesterol values above the 90th percentile also had adult values above the 90th percentile, and 81% had values above the 50th percentile (Armstrong and Simons-Morton, 1994
; Mahoney et al., 1991
). Figure 15.15
 depicts total cholesterol values for adolescent males and females of different ethnic backgrounds. Although not shown in the figure, approximately 8.5% of adolescents have total cholesterol values at or above 200 mg·dL−1
 (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
).

Values that represent acceptable, borderline, and high-risk levels for children are included in
 
Table 15.4

. In adults, high TC, high LDL-C, and low HDL-C levels have been found to relate to the magnitude of early atherosclerotic lesions. Autopsy reports have confirmed that early signs of atherosclerosis are present in children as young as 3 years and are frequently evident by age 10. Poor lipid profiles often run in families because of both genetics and shared lifestyle factors. Insufficient evidence is available regarding the role of the apolipoproteins in children although it has been shown that as the number of metabolic syndrome component criteria increases so does the ratio of Apo-B to Apo-A1 (

Retnakaran et al., 2006

).




Cross-sectional studies of the relationship between physical activity and lipid levels have reported that active youngsters have higher HDL-C values and lower TG than do inactive youngsters, but TC levels and LDL-C that do not differ with activity status. However, the relationship between physical fitness and lipid risk factors is stronger than that of physical activity and these factors. Studies indicate that high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness for both boys and girls and/or muscular fitness in girls are associated with a more favorable lipid-metabolic profile (

Garcia-Artero et al., 2007

;
 
Janssen and LeBlanc, 2010

;
 
Ortega et al., 2008

). Cardiorespiratory fitness in childhood and adolescence is a predictor of abnormal blood lipids later in life (

Ruiz et al., 2009

). Training studies, including clinical and school-based programs, have shown beneficial effects for HDL-C and TG if the intervention has been sufficient to also improve aerobic fitness, but not for TC or LDL-C. However, a recent study that compared a 12-week training program for adolescent swimmers and soccer players to a control group of nonathletic but physically active contemporaries found that the soccer group decreased LDL-C levels compared to the other two groups. In addition, both training groups had positive changes in HDL-C, Apo-A1, Apo-B, and the Apo-A1 to Apo-B ratio compared with the controls (

Koozehchian et al., 2014

). A minimum of 40 min·d
−1
, 5 d·wk
−1
 of at least moderate to vigorous activity over 4 months is apparently needed to achieve beneficial effects in lipid levels in children and adolescents (

Andersen et al., 2011

;
 
Mountjoy et al., 2011

;
 
Strong et al., 2005

).



Cigarette Smoking



Figure 15.16
 reports the prevalence of cigarette smoking among high school students (grades 9–12) by race/ethnicity and sex. The highest prevalence of student smoking occurs in males, regardless of race (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
). Approximately 80% of adult smokers started
 smoking before age 18 (AHA, 2007
); smoking definitely tracks from adolescence to adulthood. The physiological effects of smoking and the indirect relationship between activity and smoking are the same regardless of the age of the smoker.

One study of Finnish youth showed that over a 6-year span, with individuals who were 12, 15, and 18 years old at the beginning of the study, higher activity levels were associated with less smoking in both boys and girls. Almost half of those who were sedentary smoked, but only about 10% of those who were active smoked (

Raitakari et al., 1994

). A 2011 study (

Horn et al., 2011

) investigated the effects of physical activity on teen smoking cessation. Individuals who had smoked in the previous 30 days were randomly assigned to brief intervention, Not on Tobacco (a proven teen cessation program) or Not on Tobacco plus a physical activity module. Smoking cessation rates were determined at 3 and 6 months after baseline. Results indicated that teens in the Not on Tobacco plus physical activity group had significantly higher cessation rates than did either of the other two programs. While physical activity can assist in smoking cessation, it remains a primary goal of physical education and exercise science professionals to encourage an active lifestyle and discourage the onset of smoking in children and adolescents.



Diabetes Mellitus


Children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are at risk of prematurely developing atherosclerosis. Furthermore, diabetes tracks into adulthood. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has risen dramatically in children and adolescents in recent years—in large part paralleling the incidence in obesity (Figure 15.17
). The prevalence
 of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children increased 30.5% between the years 2001–2009. Among US adolescents (12–19 years), the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus increased from 9% to 23% of the population (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
).









FIGURE 15.17
 Unhealthy Food Choices Contribute to the High Level of Childhood Obesity.





There is growing evidence of a positive relationship between physical activity (both aerobic and resistance) and insulin sensitivity independent of adiposity status or changes in children and adolescents. More physical activity results in improved insulin sensitivity (and hence reduced insulin resistance) in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (

Chimen et al., 2012

;
 
Kim and Park, 2013

). However, even if positive changes in adiposity are not required to reap insulin sensitivity changes, the early establishment and maintenance of activity can benefit both glucose/insulin variables and body fatness (

Bunt et al., 2003

;
 
Rowland, 2006

). It may be that regular, high-intensity physical activity is needed for both cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity to show associations with insulin sensitivity as the relationship between physical activity and insulin sensitivity is somewhat stronger and more consistent than that for cardiovascular fitness (

Berman et al., 2012

). Results are inconsistent for the influence of physical activity and cardiovascular fitness on glycemic control in type 1 and 2 diabetes (

Chimen et al., 2012

;
 
Liese et al., 2013

) although a 2014 meta-analysis of 10 studies reported an improvement in glycemic control from systematic physical activity in those with type 1 diabetes (

MacMillan et al., 2014

). Regular physical activity has beneficial effects on the presence of glucose in the blood in type 1 diabetes without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia (

Chimen et al., 2012

;
 
Herbst et al., 2006

). The importance of and cautions related to physical activity and exercise training for individuals with diabetes were discussed earlier in the section on adults but also apply here for younger individuals. The optimal exercise prescription or recommended activity level has yet to be determined for reducing insulin resistance and improving insulin sensitivity (

Chimen et al., 2012

;
 
Kim and Park, 2013

).



Hypertension


Hypertension is evident in children as young as 6 years of age. In children, hypertension is defined as average SBP or DBP that is greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height on three or more occasions (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005
). Table 15.7
 provides mean blood pressure values for children based on age at the 50th and 75th percentile of height (National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Hypertension Control in Children and Adolescents, 1996
). Recent data suggest that only 82% of children met the ideal cardiovascular health metric for hypertension, a troubling statistic given the negative health consequences of hypertension (Mozaffarian et al., 2015
).





TABLE 15.7
 Mean Blood Pressure Values for Girls and Boys Based on Height







Source:
 Adapted from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Hypertension Control in Children and Adolescents (1996). DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.





Although childhood blood pressures do not predict adult blood pressures per se, there is a definite tendency for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures to track from childhood to adulthood. In one study, children with blood pressures at the 90th percentile had three times the risk of having high adult systolic blood pressure and twice the risk of having high adult diastolic blood pressure as those whose childhood values were at the 50th percentile (

Mahoney et al., 1991

). There is strong evidence indicating that cardiorespiratory fitness in childhood and adolescence is a predictor of high blood pressure later in life (

Ruiz et al., 2009

). In addition, there is a dose-response relationship between aerobic fitness and blood pressure in youth. That is, the least fit boys and girls have been shown to be more likely to have hypertension than their high fit peers. This relationship is strongest in overweight children (

Andersen et al., 2011

). A similar inverse relationship has been found between physical activity and blood pressure (

Gopinath et al., 2011

).




Physical activity intervention of at least 30 minutes, three times per week with intensity sufficient to increase aerobic fitness, has been shown to reduce blood pressure in both boys and girls with essential hypertension (

Andersen et al., 2011

;
 
Janssen and LeBlanc, 2010

;
 
Mountjoy et al., 2011

). As with adults, the reductions that do occur rarely result in normal blood pressure levels, and regular physical activity or exercise is necessary to maintain the beneficial results. Dynamic resistance training used by itself, in one study, did not bring about a reduction in either systolic or diastolic pressure. However, when weight training was instituted after a period of aerobic endurance training that resulted in reduced blood pressures, the reduction in blood pressure was maintained with just the weight training (

Andersen et al., 2011

). Therefore, as with adults, the best procedure is to begin young individuals with hypertension on a dynamic endurance activity regimen and add resistance training several months later, if desired (

Alpert and Wilmore, 1994

). There is neither a need for nor any evidence of a reduction in blood pressure in normotensive children and adolescents with exercise training (

ACSM, 2004

;
 
Mountjoy et al., 2011

;
 
Rowland, 2006

;
 
Strong et al., 2005

)

.



Overweight and Obesity


As seen in Figure 15.18
, the percentage of children 6–11 and adolescents 12–19 years old who are obese has increased dramatically since 1988. In addition, the prevalence of obesity in children 2–5 years hovers around 10%. There is a strong socioeconomic impact on the obesity prevalence in adolescents—obesity prevalence is decreasing in adolescents from high socioeconomic status but continues to rise in adolescents from low socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, overweight and obesity show evidence of tracking. An estimated 70% of overweight adolescents have a 70% chance of becoming overweight adults. This increases to an 80% chance if one or both parents are overweight or obese (Roger et al., 2011
). Approximately 80% of obese adolescents become obese adults.

There is strong evidence that body composition in childhood and adolescence is a predictor of adult CVD risk factors. There is also strong evidence that high body mass index (BMI) in childhood and adolescence increases the risk of early adult death (

Eisenmann et al., 2005

;
 
Ruiz et al., 2009

). Furthermore, fatness has been determined to be a mediator of the relationship between physical activity and several other risk factors (

Gutin and Owens, 2011

). A significant relationship between adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness and adult body fatness has been demonstrated. The deleterious consequences of high fatness can to a meaningful extent be counteracted by having high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (

Ortega et al., 2008

).




As for adults, the relationship between exercise training and reduced body weight and body fat is detailed in the metabolic unit of this text for children and adolescents (see
 
Chapter 8

). A few brief comments are appropriate here, however. Recent research suggests that
 prevention
 of excess fatness in youths is primarily dependent on an adequate volume of vigorous intensity exercise. Youths of both sexes who participate in moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity have less body fat than do those who do not, but vigorous physical activity is associated more with lower levels of fatness than is moderate physical activity. That is, there is a dose-response relationship between physical activity and obesity. Resistance exercise may also elicit favorable changes in body composition (

Dietz et al., 2012

;
 
Gutin and Owens, 2011

;
 
Janssen and LeBlanc, 2010

;
 
Ruiz et al., 2009

). Exercise training of moderate intensity 30–60 min·d
−1
, 3–7 d·wk
−1
 reduces total body and visceral fat in overweight children and adolescents. Limited evidence suggests that more intensive and longer-duration (>80 min·d
−1
) exercise training is needed to reduce the body fat percentage in normal-weight youths of both sexes (

Strong et al., 2005

). A combination of aerobic and resistance training may be more effective than either aerobic or resistance training alone in reducing total body fat and waist circumference (

Sigal et al., 2014

). Although beneficial changes often occur in body composition in obese youngsters, decreases in body weight and body mass index are not consistently found (

Watts et al., 2005

).




Obese children have abnormalities in vascular function and structure and exhibit biochemical markers of inflammation (

Kapiotis et al., 2006

). Research shows that 60% of overweight children between the ages of 5 and 10 years have at least one other major CV risk factor (

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999

). The clustering of risk factors known as the metabolic syndrome is evident in children and adolescents with a prevalence of 3–14% in the general population and 13–37% in obese children (

Andersen et al., 2011

;
 
Weiss and Raz, 2006

). The criterion for metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents requires the presence of on an increased central/abdominal obesity plus any two of the following: a raised triglyceride level, a reduced HDL-C level, hypertension, and elevated fasting plasma glucose (

Zimmet et al., 2007

). Both physical fitness and physical activity are inversely related to metabolic syndrome risk factors. Furthermore, an interaction

 between physical activity and physical fitness suggests a stronger relationship between activity and metabolic risk factors in those with low cardiorespiratory fitness. Thus, children and adolescents with the lowest levels of fitness should benefit most from increasing their physical activity (

Andersen et al., 2011

;
 
Brage et al., 2004

;
 
Steele et al., 2008

;
 
Wedderkopp et al., 2003

). Several exercise studies have shown improvements in specific elements of metabolic syndrome in both obese and nonobese youth (

Kamal and Ragy, 2012

;
 
Strong et al., 2005

).



Physical Inactivity


Neither lifestyle physical activity nor exercise training is likely to alter cardiovascular risk factor variables in children or adolescents whose values for these variables are normal. Maintenance of normal values, however, can be assisted by activity. Abnormal levels are consistently and positively impacted by physical activity or exercise interventions—thus deterring the continued development of that risk factor and establishing a lifestyle pattern for adulthood (Rowland, 2006
). For example, significant tracking of physical activity was observed in a Finnish study of both boys and girls, with 44% remaining active from age 12 to 18 years, from 15 to 21 years, and from 18 to 24 years. Physical inactivity tracked even more closely, with 57% remaining inactive over the 6 years of the study. Those who remained active had better risk factor profiles than did their inactive counterparts. They smoked less, were less fat, had higher HDL-C and lower TC values, and had favorable differences in insulin levels. They also had a healthier diet, which would, of course, have affected these results (Raitakari et al., 1994
). Another study showed that physically active young male adults had had better physical fitness test results as children or adolescents (Dennison et al., 1988
).




Twisk et al. (2002)

 summarized the results from five longitudinal observational studies investigating relationships between physical activity and cardiorespiratory physical fitness in youth and CVD risk factors later in life. Childhood physical fitness was found to be predictive of a healthy CVD risk profile later in life, while physical activity was not. As with adults, the difficulty of accurately measuring physical activity may be partially responsible for these results. It may also be that physical fitness more directly indicates the quality of the cardiorespiratory system or that the predictive value of physical fitness may be caused by the relationship between physical fitness and body fat percentage. Or, as with adults, it may be that physical fitness and physical activity need to be considered separate risk factors in youth. This means that both physical fitness and physical activity need to be measured, evaluated, and acted on when an individual’s results warrant improvement.




Data regarding physical inactivity among children and adolescents are alarming. As seen in
 
Figure 15.19

, only slightly more than 50% of male students in grade 9–12 met physical activity guidelines, and only 30–40% of females did so (

Mozaffarian et al., 2015

). Even more disconcerting, there is a marked discrepancy between those who self-reported being active (as shown in the figure) and those who actually were that active when measured objectively with portable motion sensors. Part of the problem is that only 33.3% of students in K-12 attend physical education classes daily (

Roger et al., 2011

).












FIGURE 15.19

 on 5 or more of the 7 days preceding the survey.





Source:
 Mozaffarian et al. (2015). Reprinted with permission.





Note that the recommended amount of activity for children and youths is 60 min·d
−1
 (

SHAPE America, 2013

;
 
Strong et al., 2005

;
 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008

). Research not only has reinforced the 60-minute daily minimum but has indicated that physical activity levels might need to be at least 90 min·d
−1
 to prevent insulin resistance, which appears to be a central component in the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors (

Andersen et al., 2006

). This does not mean that children and adolescents should be expected to participate in 90-minute exercise sessions. It does mean that a variety of options for accumulating physical activity should be available each day, including daily school physical education classes, free play, recess, before and after school programs, intramurals, recreational and educational athletic programs, and lifestyle activities such as biking or walking for transportation (

Pate et al., 2006

;
 
Weiss and Raz, 2006

).




As with adults, there is now a large body of evidence showing that, independent of physical activity levels, sedentary behaviors exhibit a dose-response relationship with unfavorable health outcomes in children and adolescents. Similarly, there is evidence that decreasing any type of sedentary time (but especially limiting television time to under 2 hr·d
−1
) is associated with lower health risks in youth aged 5–17 years. Thus, there is the need to advocate for both increases in physical activity and decreases in sedentary behavior in children and adolescents (

Tremblay et al., 2011

)

.



Nontraditional Risk Factors


CRP is a marker of inflammation and inflammation is central to all stages of atherosclerosis. Many pediatric studies have shown that elevated CRP is associated with CVD risk factors including excess body fat and blood pressure. High CRP levels are seen in children with metabolic syndrome, and high childhood CRP levels predict high adult CRP levels. A relationship between elevated CRP levels and reduced fitness in normal-weight children has been reported. Despite these preliminary indications, it is not yet clear whether high CRP levels during childhood and adolescence lead to an increased risk of CVD in later life (Balagopal et al., 2011
). Physical activity has been shown to have a positive effect on CRP in children (Andersen et al., 2011
).



Fibrinogen is also a key player in the promotion of atherogenesis and may be an independent risk factor for CVD. Studies in children and adolescents have demonstrated a positive relationship between fibrinogen and obesity, and a negative relationship with physical fitness. Physical activity-based interventions in youths have shown consistent decreases in the level of fibrinogen.

 Fibrinolytic activity refers to the breakdown of fibrin clots. High levels of PAI-1 (a protein that inhibits fibrinolytic activity) have been reported in obese children. The effect of physical activity on levels of PAI-1 and the fibrinolytic system are mixed in children and adolescents. Thus, again, despite promising preliminary findings, the potential use of fibrinogen/fibrinolytic activity as markers of CVD risk in children and adolescents needs to be confirmed with longitudinal studies (

Balagopal et al., 2011

).




A 2009 study (

Roemmich et al., 2009

) was the first to study stress reactivity and exercise in children. It determined that DBP, SBP, and HR reactivity to a speech stressor was dampened after exercise compared to TV watching in a group of 8- to 12-year-old children. Surprisingly, physical fitness was positively associated with HR reactivity. Further research is needed to fully determine the impact of physical activity and physical fitness on the stress responses of children and adolescents.






FOCUS ON RESEARCH:
 Clinically Relevant





The Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Acute Exercise






As has been discussed throughout this chapter, regular physical activity is widely advocated because substantial research evidence suggests that physical activity and exercise training delay the development of CVD risk factors, atherosclerosis, and CHD events. Despite all of the positive benefits, however, vigorous physical exercise can also acutely and transiently increase the risk of heart attacks (acute myocardial infarctions) and sudden cardiac death in susceptible individuals. For example, studies have reported 1 death per 133,000 males and 1 death per 769,000 females for high school and college athletes, including all nontraumatic deaths. In older adults 1 death per 82,000 members for a mortality rate of 1 per 2.57 million workouts over 2 years has been reported by a large commercial fitness center chain. This is based on 71 deaths in that time with a mean age of 52 years. Nearly half of these deaths occurred in members who exercised infrequently or less than once a week.







Exercise-associated acute cardiac events generally occur in individuals with known or unknown cardiac disease. In young individuals, this most commonly means hereditary or congenital cardiovascular abnormalities. In this population, the health risks of vigorous physical activity exceed the benefits, although moderate physical activity may be beneficial in terms of preventing other health risks or problems. In older individuals, coronary artery disease is the most common pathological finding. Habitual vigorous physical activity appears to reduce the risk of CHD death in patients with diagnosed disease such that the benefits of physical activity appear to outweigh the risks.








Several strategies are suggested for reducing the likelihood of an exercise-induced cardiac event:






1.
 Maintain physical fitness through regular physical activity because a disproportionate number of events occur in the least physically active subjects performing unaccustomed vigorous physical activity.




2.
 Both young athletes and adults should undergo preparticipation screening before engaging in vigorous physical activity.




3.
 High-risk individuals may need to be excluded from or restricted in vigorous activity.




4.
 Physically inactive individuals and patients with known cardiovascular disease should avoid strenuous, unaccustomed exercise in both excessively cold and hot conditions and at altitude.




5.
 Individuals should be encouraged to monitor their bodies for early symptoms of cardiovascular events and seek medical attention. Such symptoms include but are not limited to chest pain, increasing fatigue, feelings of indigestion, and excessive breathlessness.




6.
 Health-fitness facilities should:




a.
 Perform pre-entry screening by appropriately trained personnel




b.
 Have written emergency policies




c.
 Regularly conduct emergency drills and cardiopulmonary resuscitation practices




d. Have an automatic external defibrillator available for use by trained personnel




e. Establish a “hotline” to summon emergency medical care

SUMMARY





1.
 Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in the United States, accounting for over 30% of all deaths. Coronary heart disease is the most prevalent type of CVD. Coronary heart disease is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries.




2.
 Cardiovascular risk factors are classified as nonmodifiable (age, heredity, race, and sex); major modifiable (cholesterol-lipid fractions, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity); and contributing and nontraditional (apolipoproteins, CRP, fibrinogen, fibrinolytic activity, and stress).




3.
 Triglycerides and a small amount of cholesterol are transported from the small intestines or liver to adipose tissue or muscles by chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).




4.
 VLDLs are degraded into intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), which, in turn, are converted to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in the liver. LDL transports 60–70% of the total cholesterol (TC) in the body to all cells except liver cells.




5.
 High-density lipoproteins (HDL) may block cholesterol uptake at the cellular or tissue level. HDL definitely carries cholesterol away from the sites of deposit to the liver, where the cholesterol can be broken down and eliminated in the bile.




6.
 Arteriosclerosis is characterized by a thickening of the arterial wall, inflammation, loss of elastic connective tissue, and hardening of the vessel wall.




7.
 Atherosclerosis is a pathological process that results in the buildup of plaque (composed of connective tissue, smooth muscle cells, cellular debris, and cholesterol) inside the vessel. The buildup of plaque obstructs blood flow and increases the risk of thrombosis. Depending on the amount of obstruction, the result can be pain, a heart attack, or a stroke.




8.
 Active individuals generally have lipid profiles that indicate a reduced risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).




9.
 The atherosclerotic process is accelerated in individuals who smoke cigarettes. Smoking injures the arterial wall lining, increases the levels of circulating TC, and decreases the amount of HDL-C. Smoking also causes blood platelets to adhere to each other, speeds up the rate of internal blood clotting, and makes the clots tougher to dissolve.




10.
 Individuals who are at high risk for developing hypertension can reduce the risk by participating in an endurance training program. Most hypertensive individuals experience decreased blood pressure as a result of a consistent aerobic endurance exercise program.




11.
 Only about 30% of Americans report regular leisure-time activity. Therefore, potentially more benefit overall could be achieved by increasing the activity level of US citizens than by changing any other single CHD risk factor.




12.
 Metabolic syndrome is a progressive disease process in which high visceral abdominal obesity is directly related to dyslipidemia, inflammation, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and hypertension, which together form a cluster of risk factors for CVD. Regular exercise results in favorable changes in each of these risk factors.




13.
 The beginnings of metabolic syndrome and CVD occur during childhood and adolescence. In general, risk factors track into adulthood and can predict future CVD. Physical activity and physical fitness are important moderators of risk factor development and progression in childhood and adolescence.
