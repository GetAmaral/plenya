Introduction





Chapter 3 concentrates on anaerobic exercise responses: situations in which energy is provided predominantly by stored ATP-PC or by the production of ATP through anaerobic glycolysis. Chapter 3
 also describes anaerobic participation in exercises of lower intensity and longer duration and incremental exercise to maximum. This chapter focuses on the aerobic responses to the different intensities, durations, and types of exercise. Keep in mind throughout this chapter that aerobic metabolism predominates in activity lasting approximately 2 minutes or longer but that the onset of all activity involves some amount of anaerobic metabolism during the oxygen-deficit period. Excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) occurs following submaximal as well as maximal exercise and is evident following aerobic as well as dynamic resistance exercise.




Laboratory Measurement of Aerobic Metabolism




The primary goal of measuring aerobic metabolism is to quantify how much energy is needed to complete a given activity. This goal can be approached in two ways. To understand these approaches, consider two known aspects of aerobic metabolism. First, aerobic metabolism requires oxygen; and second, it produces heat as a by-product. Therefore, aerobic metabolism can be assessed by measuring oxygen consumption or heat production. Oxygen consumption is measured by indirect open-circuit spirometry, and heat production is measured by calorimetry, as summarized in Figure 4.1
.









FIGURE 4.1
 Measurement of Aerobic Metabolism.
 Aerobic metabolism can be measured by direct calorimetry or indirect spirometry. In exercise physiology, open-circuit indirect spirometry/open-circuit indirect calorimetry, in which expired gases are analyzed for O2
 consumed and CO2
 produced, is typically used. Note
:
 Colored boxes indicate processes typically used in exercise physiology.




Calorimetry


The term calorimetry
 is derived from the word calorie
, the basic unit of heat energy. Calorimetry
 is the measurement of heat energy liberated or absorbed in metabolic processes. Direct calorimetry
 actually measures heat production. This measurement requires the use of specially constructed chambers in which the heat produced by a subject increases the temperature of the air or water surrounding the walls and is thereby measured.





Calorimetry
 The measurement of heat energy liberated or absorbed in metabolic processes.



Spirometry
 An indirect calorimetry method for estimating heat production, in which expired air is analyzed for the amount of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced.





Accurate exercise data are difficult to obtain because exercise equipment, even if it fits into the usually small space required, can also emit heat. In addition, the body may store heat (as evidenced by a rise in body temperature) and/or sweat (which must be accounted for). Despite these drawbacks, the direct measurement of heat is the most precise use of the term
 calorimetry
.



Spirometry



Spirometry
 is an indirect calorimetry method for estimating heat production in which expired air is measured and analyzed for the amount of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced. It is also the direct measurement of air breathed. This method is based on the fact that oxygen consumption at rest or during submaximal exercise is directly proportional to the aerobic production of ATP and, when expressed as calories, is equal to the heat produced by the body as measured by direct calorimetry. However, since heat is not measured directly, spirometry is an indirect
 measure.



In a
 closed system
, the subject breathes from a sealed container filled with gas of a designated composition (often 99.9% O
2
). Expired CO
2
 is usually absorbed by a chemical such as soda lime. The rate of utilization of the available O
2
 is then determined. This system has a large error and is rarely used. It is mentioned here so that the terminology of an open circuit can be understood.




In
 open-circuit spirometry
, the subject inhales room or outdoor air from his or her surroundings and exhales

 into the same surroundings. The oxygen content of the inhaled air is normally 20.93%; the carbon dioxide does not need to be absorbed but is simply exhaled into the surrounding atmosphere. A sample of the expired air is analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide content.




Putting these factors together results in the descriptor
 open-circuit indirect spirometry
. The term
 open-circuit indirect calorimetry
 should technically be reserved for use when calories are calculated from oxygen consumption, but, in fact, that term is often used interchangeably with open-circuit indirect spirometry, and we will do so in this text.




Measuring oxygen consumption by open-circuit indirect spirometry is a valid way to assess aerobic metabolism during resting and steady-state submaximal exercise conditions when the relationship between oxygen consumption and ATP production remains linear. However, in situations also involving anaerobic energy production, the actual energy cost of the exercise will be underestimated, because the linear relationship no longer exists and there is no way to account for the anaerobic portion.




Open-circuit indirect spirometry can be used to measure oxygen consumption during any physical activity. However, the size, sensitivity, and lack of portability of the equipment have, until recently, limited its use to modalities that can be performed in a laboratory or a special swimming pool setup. By far, the most popular exercise-testing modalities in the laboratory are the motor-driven treadmill and the cycle ergometer. Measurements can be performed with the subject at rest, during submaximal exercise, or at maximal levels of exertion. The following sections describe in detail how these measurements are done and the aerobic responses to varying patterns of exercise.





Aerobic Exercise Responses





Figure 4.2
 shows an individual attached to an analysis system for open-circuit indirect spirometry. The individual uses a breathing valve, which permits air to flow in only one direction at a time—in from room air and out toward the sampling chamber. The nose clip ensures that the individual breathes only through the mouth.

Oxygen Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Production



Figure 4.3
 shows schematic configurations of an open-circuit system in which the volume of either inspired air (Figure 4.3A
) or expired air (Figure 4.3B
) is measured and the expired air is analyzed for the percentage of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Although oxygen consumption is the variable of primary interest, given its direct relationship with ATP, determining the amount of carbon dioxide produced is also important because that measure enables a determination about fuel utilization and caloric expenditure.

Oxygen consumption (


)
 is technically the
 amount
 of oxygen taken up, transported, and used at the cellular level. It equals the amount of oxygen inspired minus the amount of oxygen expired. However, as the symbol
 

 indicates, it is commonly labeled as the
 volume
 of oxygen consumed. Similarly,
 carbon dioxide produced (


)
 is technically the amount of carbon dioxide generated during metabolism, primarily from aerobic cellular respiration. It equals the amount of carbon dioxide expired minus the amount of carbon dioxide inspired. As with
 

,
 

 is commonly described as the volume of carbon dioxide produced.






Oxygen Consumption (
)
 The amount or volume of oxygen taken up, transported, and used at the cellular level.



Carbon Dioxide Produced (
)
 The amount or volume of carbon dioxide generated during metabolism.





The
 amount
 of a gas equals the volume of air (either inhaled or exhaled) times the percentage of the gas. Therefore, to determine these amounts, the volume of air either inhaled or exhaled is measured, as are the percentages of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the exhaled air. The percentages of oxygen and carbon dioxide in

 inhaled air are known to be 20.93% and 0.03%, respectively. These mathematical relationships can be formulated as follows:



4.1 



4.2 




The volume of air inhaled is usually not exactly equal to the volume of air exhaled. However, knowing either the value of air inhaled or exhaled and the gas percentages allows us to calculate the other air volume. These calculations are fully described in Appendix B.




Most laboratories use computer software to solve Equations
 
4.1

 and
 
4.2

.
 
Table 4.1

 gives the results of such a computer program for a metabolic test. The first 3 minutes represent resting values. The values for the next 8 minutes were obtained during treadmill walking at 3.5 mi·hr
−1
 (94 m·min
−1
, or 5.6 km·hr
−1
) at 7% grade. Ignore for the time being minutes 33 through 37 as well as the missing minutes. Locate in
 
Figure 4.3

 the pieces equipment referred to in the following discussion. The dot above the volume symbol (


) indicates per unit of time, which is usually 1 minute.




TABLE 4.1
 Aerobic Metabolic Responses at Rest and during Submaximal Exercise







The volume of air inspired (


) or expired (


) is measured by a pneumoscan or flowmeter (labeled as the dry gas meter in
 
Figure 4.3

). Typically, all ventilation values are reported as expired values that have been adjusted to standard temperature (0°C), standard pressure (760 mmHg), and dry (without water vapor) conditions, known as STPD. The process and rationale for standardizing ventilatory volumes are discussed fully in
 
Chapter 9

. Standardization permits comparisons between data collected under different conditions. Two things should be noted about the
 

 STPD values. First, the values for exercise (Ex) are higher than those at rest (R) (


 = 7.93 L·min
–1
,
 

 = 25.41 L·min
–1
). Second, within each condition, the values are very stable

.




The air the subject exhales is sampled from a mixing chamber and analyzed by electronic gas analyzers that have been previously calibrated by gases of known composition. Data about the percentage of expired oxygen (O
2
% in
 
Table 4.1

) and carbon dioxide (CO
2
% in
 
Table 4.1

) are relayed from the gas analyzers along with ventilation values through an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter to the computer.




Remember that room air is composed of 20.93% O
2
, 0.03% CO
2
, 79.04% N
2
, and other trace elements such as argon and krypton. N
2
 is considered to be inert in human metabolism. However, as we have seen in the metabolic pathways, O
2
 is consumed and CO
2
 is produced when ATP is generated aerobically. Therefore, in general, the exhaled O
2
% will be lower than the value in ambient air, ranging around 15–16% during moderate exercise. Exhaled CO
2
 values will be greater than that in room air, increasing to somewhere around 4–6% during moderate exercise. Note these values in
 
Table 4.1

. During rest, not much oxygen is used, so the percentage exhaled is relatively high
 

 = 17.09%. The accompanying percentage of CO
2
 is, as would be expected, relatively low (


 = 3.28%). During exercise, more O
2
 is used to produce energy, so there is a lower percentage of O
2
 exhaled (


 = 15.93%). The use of more O
2
 to produce more energy also results in the production of more CO
2
 (


 = 4.66%).




The computer software uses metabolic formulas to correct ventilation for temperature (room temperature if
 

 is measured); expired air temperature (if
 

 is measured), relative humidity (if
 

 is measured), and barometric pressure. Then using the expired percentage values of O
2
 and CO
2
, it calculates values for the volume of O
2
 consumed ( 


 in L·min
−1
 and
 

 in mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
), CO
2
 produced (


 in L·min
−1
), and the ratio of the volume of CO
2
 produced to the volume of O
2
 consumed, known as the respiratory exchange ratio (RER).




Sometimes this relationship is designated simply as R, but this text will consistently use RER. The
 

 and
 

 values are actual volumes of the gases that are used and produced by the body, respectively. The L·min
−1
 unit represents the absolute amount of gas on a per-minute basis. The mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 unit takes into account body size (body weight [BW] is given at the top of the table) and is therefore considered a relative value; it describes how many milliliters of gas are consumed (or produced) for each kilogram of BW each minute.




The absolute unit (L·min
−1
) is highly influenced by body size, with large individuals showing the highest values. Therefore, it is most useful when comparing an individual to himself or herself under different conditions, such as before and after a training program, to determine

 whether a change in fitness has occurred. Use of the absolute unit is particularly important if the individual has lost weight, because the mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 relative value goes up as weight goes down regardless of whether or not actual fitness has improved. The mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 value thus, to an extent, equates individuals by factoring out the influence of body size. It is therefore typically used for comparisons between individuals.




Another unit used to express O
2
 consumed and CO
2
 produced on a relative basis is mL·kg FFB
−1
·min
−1
 or mL·kg LBM
−1
·min
−1
, where FFB stands for fat-free body and LBM stands for lean body mass. To calculate these units, the individual’s percentage of body fat must be known and used to determine what portion of the total BW is fat free or lean. This unit is often used in comparisons between the sexes. However, it is not a very practical measure because no one has yet figured how to avoid carrying one’s fat during exercise.




At rest, the subject in the example in
 
Table 4.1

 is using about 0.31 L·min
−1
, or 310 mL·min
−1
, of oxygen and producing about 0.25 L·min
−1
 of carbon dioxide. During exercise, she is using 1.28 L·min
−1
 of oxygen and producing 1.17 L·min
−1
 of carbon dioxide.



Short-Term, Light- to Moderate-Intensity Submaximal Exercise


Look at minutes 1–8 in Table 4.1
. During this light exercise, as anticipated, there is very little minute-to-minute variation in any of the variables after the first minute of adjustment (Robergs, 2014
). A comparison of the individual’s mean oxygen cost of these 8 minutes (24.13 mL·kg−1
·min−1
) with her maximal oxygen consumption (

) (47.64 mL·kg−1
·min−1
) shows that she is working at approximately 50% 

. When the exercise performed is at less than 70% 

 and the duration is 5–10 minutes, the oxygen consumption should level off and remain relatively constant for the duration of the work after the initial rise (Figure 4.4A
). This condition is known as steady-state
 or steady-rate
 exercise. The time to achieve steady state varies from 1 to 3 minutes in youths and young adults at low and moderate levels of intensity, but it increases with higher intensity exercise (Morgan et al., 1989b
). The time to achieve steady state is longer in older untrained adults.

Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Exercise


Now look carefully at minutes 33 through 37 in Table 4.1
. Pay particular attention to the 

 L·min−1
 and mL·kg−1
·min−1
 values. Despite the fact that the workload has not changed, a gradual increase occurs in these variables. When exercise is performed at a level greater than 70% 

; or when exercise is performed at a lower percentage of 

, as in this case, but for a long duration; or if the conditions are hot and humid, a phenomenon known as oxygen drift
 occurs. In oxygen drift, the oxygen consumption increases despite the fact that the oxygen requirement of the activity has not changed. A schematic representation of oxygen drift is presented in Figure 4.4B
.





Oxygen Drift
 A situation that occurs in submaximal activity of long duration, or above 70% ​
, or in hot and humid conditions where the oxygen consumption increases, despite the fact that the oxygen requirement of the activity has not changed.





The oxygen consumption increases (drifts upward) because of rising blood levels of catecholamine hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine), lactate accu

 mulation (if the percentage of
 

 is high enough), shifting substrate utilization (to greater carbohydrate), increased cost of ventilation, and increased body temperature. Thus, although any given level of exercise typically requires a specific amount of oxygen, this amount has some individual and circumstantial variation (

Daniels, 1985

).



Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum



Table 4.2
 provides the results of a computer program for a constant work-rate transition incremental treadmill test to maximum. In this case, the subject was a very fit male senior exercise science major who regularly and successfully competed in long-distance running, cycling, and duathlon events. In an incremental exercise test such as this, the participant is asked to continue to the point of volitional fatigue
, that is, until he is too tired to go on any longer. Throughout the test, the speed and/or grade is systematically raised so that the exercise becomes progressively harder. The protocol used in this particular test is called the modified Balke. For this test, the speed was kept constant at 3.5 mi·hr−1
 (94 m·min−1
). The grade was 0% for the first minute and 2% for the second minute, increasing 1% per minute thereafter. At the treadmill limit of 25% grade, speed was then increased 13.4 m·min−1
 each minute. Because the increments are small, the individual should be able to adjust to the load change in just 1 minute for
 most of the submaximal portion. Typically, the goal is for a maximal test to last 8–12 minutes. However, in apparently healthy individuals, the duration may be between 7 and 26 minutes for the cycle ergometer and between 5 and 26 minutes for the treadmill depending on stage length and treadmill grade with shorter tests requiring a sufficient warm-up (Midgley et al., 2008
). Because of his very high fitness and ability to handle the steep slope, this individual was able to continue for 28 minutes.



TABLE 4.2
 Aerobic Metabolic Responses during an Incremental Treadmill Test (Modified Balke Protocol)







Because the work is different, the ventilation,
 

, and
 

 responses are also different from those of the submaximal steady-state exercise in
 
Table 4.1

. In the incremental task, ventilation (


),
 

, and
 

 values all increase as a result of the increasing demands for and production of energy. For this particular individual, the volume of expired air (


 STPD) rose from 25.21 L·min
−1
 at minute 2 to 139.04 L·min
−1
 at minute 28. This demonstrates the reserve capacity in the ventilatory system. Oxygen consumption increased from slightly over 1 L·min
−1
 (or almost 17 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) to just over 5 L·min
−1
 at maximum. At this point, the individual was producing as much ATP as he could aerobically.




The highest amount of oxygen an individual can take in, transport, and utilize to produce ATP aerobically while breathing air during heavy exercise is called
 maximal oxygen consumption (


)
. The exercise tester has to decide whether any given test truly is a maximal effort before labeling the highest
 

 value as maximal. Several physiological criteria have traditionally been used to determine whether the test is a maximal test: (a) a lactate value greater than 8 mmol·L
−1
 (

Åstrand, 1956

;
 
Åstrand and Rodahl, 1977

); (b) a heart rate ±12 b·min
−1
 of predicted maximal heart rate (220 minus age) (

Durstine and Pate, 1988

); (c) an RER (which is described fully later in this chapter) of 1.0 or 1.1 (

Holly, 1988

;
 
MacDougall et al., 1982

); and (d) a plateau in oxygen consumption. The plateau in oxygen consumption is considered to be the primary criterion for obtaining a true maximal test. The classic definition of a plateau is a rise of 2.1 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 or less, or a rise of 0.15 L·min
−1
 or less, in oxygen consumption (


) with an increase in workload that represents a change in grade of 2.5% while running at 7 mi·hr
−1
 (11.2 km·hr
−1
) with 3-minute stages (

Taylor et al., 1955

). Use of this criterion for all protocols, however, has been questioned (

Howley et al., 1995

). One alternative is to define a plateau as an increase of less than half the expected theoretical rise based on the change in speed, grade, or speed and grade (

Plowman and Liu, 1999

). The expected increase can be calculated using the
 
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) (2014)

 equations provided in Appendix B. In this case, the expected difference in oxygen consumption between the last 2 minutes (27 and 28) is 5.8 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
. Occasionally, a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) equal to or greater than 17 is used as a psychophysiological criterion (

Howley et al., 1995

).






Maximal Oxygen Consumption (
)
 The highest amount of oxygen an individual can take in, transport and utilize to produce ATP aerobically while breathing air during heavy exercise.





The secondary criteria have come under a great deal of scrutiny recently based in part on large variability in HRmax, RER and blood lactate responses, the failure of these criteria to be applicable to children and the elderly, and the fact that these criteria do not differentiate individuals who demonstrate a
 

 plateau from those who do not. This has led to recommendation that a verification phase be included in
 

 testing. A verification phase consists of some variation of a short constant speed run to exhaustion performed after the incremental phase of the max test and a short recovery period. A peak oxygen uptake in the verification phase that is similar (within ~2% or the
 

 value attained in the incremental phase) would indicate that a true
 

 had been elicited. A heart rate max within 4 bpm between the two tests would indicate a consistent maximal effort. Research continues to determine the best protocol for verification tests and criterion for the primary and secondary variables that indicate a true max test as well as whether a plateau is a prerequisite for being able to measure a true

The rectilinear increase in
 

 obtained during an incremental test can be generalized to all healthy individuals, both male and female, young and old, and those who are high and low in fitness. This pattern is schematically represented in
 
Figure 4.4C

. When a ramp protocol is used, that is, the work rate is increased in a linear and continuous fashion rather than in discrete incremental timed steps, minor positive or negative deviations from strict linearity may or may not occur above VT2 (

Boone and Bourgois, 2012

). However, a plateau is not always evident, especially in children and the elderly. When no plateau is achieved, the term
 peak oxygen consumption
 (


) to describe the highest value attained is more accurate than the term maximal oxygen consumption (


).




As a result of the increasing ATP production, the amount of CO
2
 produced also increases. Note in
 
Table 4.2

 that the amount of CO
2
 produced ( 


) is generally not

 equal to the amount of O
2
 consumed (


). Note also that despite the incremental nature of this test, the O
2
% and CO
2
% do not vary much. There is a slight decline in O
2
% and a parallel rise in CO
2
% after the first 10 minutes and then relatively steady values until the last 2 minutes, when the O
2
% goes back up and the CO
2
% goes back down just a little. Frequently, as a subject nears maximal exertion, the O
2
% may rise to 17% and the CO
2
% may drop to 3%. These small percentage changes, especially when they occur in the last couple of minutes, are compensated for by the increasingly larger volumes of air being ventilated.



Static and Dynamic Resistance Exercise


Physiological responses to static exercise are generally described in relation to the percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) at which they take place. Depending on the muscle group used, static contractions below 15–25% MVC do not fully occlude blood flow, such that oxygen can still be delivered to working muscles. At such loads, however, little extra energy above the resting level is required, and oxygen consumption increases minimally, perhaps as little as 50 mL·min−1
, but for as long as half an hour (Asmussen, 1981
; Shepard et al., 1981
).



The higher the percentage of MVC of the static contraction, the greater the intramuscular pressure is, the more likely it is that the blood flow will be completely arrested or occluded, and the shorter the time that the contraction can be maintained. If occlusion of blood flow is not complete, oxygen consumption increases. This increased oxygen consumption is higher than the amount at lower percentages of MVC but still far below the rise in values that occurs during the aerobic endurance exercises previously described.




In addition to a lower oxygen consumption, there is one other major difference between static and dynamic-endurance exercise. At the cessation of static exercise, when blood flow is fully restored, a sudden increase in oxygen consumption occurs (

Figure 4.5

) before the slow, gradual decline of the typical EPOC curve begins (

Asmussen, 1981

;
 
Shepard et al., 1981

).










FIGURE 4.5
 Respiratory and Metabolic Responses to Heavy Static Exercise.
 Heavy static exercise causes small respiratory (a-vO2
diff and 
) and metabolic (
 and RER) responses during the actual contraction. However, each of these variables shows an increased rebound effect immediately upon cessation of the exercise before slowly returning to preexercise values. Source

The primary source of energy for dynamic resistance activity such as weight lifting or wrestling is anaerobic (

Fleck and Kraemer, 1987

;
 
Fox and Mathews, 1974

). In part, anaerobic energy is used because dynamic resistance exercise has a static component. In part, anaerobic energy is used due to the high intensity and short duration of the exercise. Despite the predominance of anaerobic energy sources, dynamic resistance activity has an aerobic component as well. The more the repetitions and the longer the duration of the sets in a weight-lifting workout, the greater is the aerobic contribution.
 

 has been shown to exhibit a linear relationship to mean concentric power as well as total concentric work in the chest press (

Buitrago et al., 2014

). Actual values are not

 available for different routines because such activities are intended for anaerobic, not aerobic, benefits. However, an example of the oxygen contribution to five sets of 6–12 repetitions per set of supine leg press exercise can be seen in
 
Figure 4.6

 (

Tesch et al., 1990

). In this group of untrained males, a gradual rise in oxygen consumption occurs over the first three sets, at which point the oxygen consumption basically stabilizes for the remaining two sets. The oxygen cost represents approximately 33–47% of the average
 

 for these subjects. Thus, the aerobic contribution during weight-lifting exercise can be expected to be somewhat less than the oxygen costs of most aerobic endurance activities but higher than the cost of purely static exercise (

Tesch et al., 1990

).










FIGURE 4.6
 Aerobic Contribution to Dynamic Resistance Exercise.
 Oxygen consumption was measured before and during five sets of 6–12 repetitions of supine leg presses. The values represent the combined results of two groups: one performed only the concentric (lifting) phase and the other performed both the concentric and eccentric (lowering) phases. The addition of the eccentric phase represented such a low additional energy cost just above the concentric energy expenditure that it was not separated out. Source

Very-Short-Term, High-Intensity Anaerobic Exercise


As stated in Chapter 3
, historically the contribution of aerobic metabolism to short, intense exercise has probably been underestimated because of the difficulty of obtaining accurate measurements. However, even the most widely used anaerobic test, the 30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test, has an aerobic energy contribution of at least 20%.


The Oxygen Cost of Breathing


Part of the oxygen used both at rest and during exercise goes to support the respiratory muscles. This value does not remain constant but varies with the intensity of activity. During rest, the respiratory system uses about 1–2% of the total body oxygen consumption, or 2.5 mL·min−1
 of oxygen. The oxygen cost of ventilation is higher in children than in middle-aged or older adults (Bar-Or, 1983
; Pardy et al., 1984
).



During light to moderate submaximal dynamic aerobic exercise, where
 

 is less than 60 L·min
−1
, the respiratory oxygen cost changes to about 25–100 mL·min
−1
, 1.8 mL
 

·L

·
min
-1
, or 3–5% of total body
 

. At heavy submaximal exercise, when
 

 is between 60 and 120 L·min
−1
, respiratory oxygen use may rise to 50–400 mL·min
−1
. During incremental exercise to maximum, the initial
 

 during the lower exercise stages shows a very gradual curvilinear rise, reflecting the submaximal changes described previously. At workloads above those requiring a
 

 greater than 120 L·min
−1
, a dramatic exponential curve occurs. In this curve, by the time a
 

 of 180 L·min

 is achieved in a very fit individual, 1,000–1,300 mL·min

Pardy et al., 1984

). The oxygen cost of breathing is higher in both younger and older females than in males (

Dominelli et al., 2015

;
 
Topin et al., 2003

).




Theoretically, there may be a maximal level of ventilation above which any further increase in oxygen consumption would be used entirely by the ventilatory musculature, thus limiting maximal exercise (

Otis, 1954

;
 
Pardy et al., 1984

;
 
Vella et al., 2006

). At what precise point this critical level of ventilation occurs is unknown. However, even if a critical ventilation level does not exist, respiration does utilize a significant portion of the
 

 during heavy exercise (

Shephard, 1966

;
 
Vella et al., 2006

). In old age, the higher oxygen cost of breathing may be a significant factor in limiting exercise performance (

Shepard et al., 1981

).




Smoking increases the oxygen cost of respiration during exercise. However, an abstinence of even 1 day can substantially reduce this effect of cigarette smoking (

Rode and Shephard, 1971

;
 
Shepard et al., 1981

).



Respiratory Quotient/Respiratory Exchange Ratio


When the 

 consumed and 

 produced during exercise are known, much useful information can be derived. One such derived variable—RER
, or respiratory exchange ratio
—is given in both Tables 4.1
 and 4.2
.





Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER)
 Ratio of the volume of CO2 produced divided by the volume of O2 consumed in the body as a whole.



Respiratory Quotient (RQ)
 Ratio of the amount of carbon dioxide produced divided by the amount of oxygen consumed at cellular level.





The RER reflects on a total body level what is happening at the cellular level. The ratio of the amount of CO
2
 produced to the amount of O
2
 consumed at the cellular level is termed the
 respiratory quotient (RQ)
. The formula i

This formula may also be computed using L·g
−1
 in place of molecules.




The values of carbon dioxide produced and oxygen consumed are known for the oxidation of carbohydrate, fat, and protein, both on a cellular level and in absolute amounts (L·g
−1
). The latter values are presented in
 
Table 4.3

. The amount of oxygen consumed and the amount of carbon dioxide produced vary among the major fuel sources because of the differences in their chemical composition. The following examples compute the cellular level RQ for each major fuel source both per mole of a specific substrate (the carbohydrate, glucose, C

Equation 4.3

 to determine the RQ. The values of 1.0 for carbohydrate, 0.7 for fat, and 0.81 for protein calculated in the example are the classic accepted values for RQ.

For carbohydrates:

)











For fat:





Palmitic acid (per mole)








Fatty acids (per gram, from Table 4.3
)











For protein:





Albumin (per mole)








Protein (per gram, from Table 4.3
)











Note that if the branched chain amino acids are used, the RQ would be lower:












Because these values for RQ have been derived from the cellular oxidation of specific foodstuffs, knowing the RQ allows one to estimate the fuels utilized in different activities. However, because individuals seldom use only one fuel, these “classic values” are rarely seen. Nonetheless, in a resting individual, an RQ of 0.93 indicates a high reliance on carbohydrate, and an RQ of 0.75 indicates a high

 reliance on fat. An RQ of 0.82 indicates either a fasting individual burning protein (usually from muscle mass, as in a starvation situation) or, more likely, an individual using a normal mixed diet of all three fuels. Remember that protein is not normally used as a major fuel source, especially at rest.




Although these interpretations are acceptable for resting individuals, there are several difficulties interpreting the RQ during exercise. In the first place, the O
2
 and CO
2
 values measured in open-circuit indirect spirometry are ventilatory measures that indicate total body gas exchange and not just working muscle. Second, hyperventilation from any cause will result in an excess of CO
2
 being exhaled, thus falsely elevating the ratio. This often occurs in stress situations such as in anticipation of an exercise test or in early recovery from maximal work. Third, if exercise is of a high enough intensity to involve anaerobic metabolism, causing an increase in acidity (a decrease in pH) and a concomitant rise in nonmetabolic CO
2
 release, RQ no longer represents just fuel utilization. Values during exercise, especially as an individual approaches maximal effort, usually exceed 1.0. In this case, it is assumed that the fuel source is carbohydrate and the excess CO
2
 is a result of anaerobic metabolism. Conversely, after an initial increase during recovery, CO
2
 is retained, causing low values (

Newsholme and Leech, 1983

). For these reasons, the term RER is more accurate than RQ to describe the ratio of
 

 produced to
 

 consumed when determined by open-circuit spirometry.




The involvement of anaerobic metabolism that results in RER values greater than 1.0 allows for use of RER as a criterion to determine whether an exercise test is truly maximal. As indicated earlier, the criterion for a true maximal test is an RER greater than 1.1 or at least 1.0, with the lower value predominating for children/adolescents and older adults (

Holly, 1988

;
 
MacDougall et al., 1982

).




Although RER is a more accurate description than RQ, RER values still do not distinguish between different forms of a fuel, such as glucose or glycogen, fatty acids, or ketone bodies. Also, when only ventilatory CO
2
 and O
2
 are measured, there is no indication of protein utilization. To measure protein utilization, the amount of nitrogen excreted (in urine and sweat) must be measured. This task is at best cumbersome and at worst almost impossible to perform in exercise situations (

Bursztein et al., 1989

;
 
Consolazio et al., 1963

). Thus, the RER that is measured by the
 

 L·min
−1
 ÷
 

 L·min
−1
 during exercise is a
 nonprotein RER
. Again, because protein is not thought to be utilized as fuel until long-duration activity is in progress, this simplification is not deemed to materially affect the relative percentage of carbohydrate and fat utilization in most situations.





Table 4.4

 presents the relative percentages of calories used from carbohydrate and fat for all RER values between 0.7 and 1.0 (

Carpenter, 1921

). Referring to
 
Table 4.1

, we see that, during rest, the individual had an RER of 0.81. From
 
Table 4.4

, this value indicates that 35.4% of her fuel was carbohydrate and 64.6% fat. During her 8 minutes of steady-state work, the RER averaged 0.90, indicating a major shift in fuel supply, with 66% of the fuel being carbohydrate and 34% fat.

 Percentage of Calories from Carbohydrate (CHO) and Fat and the Caloric Equivalents for Nonprotein RER Values for Each Liter of Oxygen Used









Source:
 Modified from Carpenter (1921).





During the last 5-minute interval (minutes 33–37 in
 
Table 4.1

), an even greater reliance on carbohydrate occurs with approximately 90% of the energy used being supplied by carbohydrate sources. If submaximal exercise were to continue for another 2 hours or more, the RER values would drop back down, indicating a depletion of available carbohydrate fuel stores. How low the RER values would go depends on the amount of carbohydrate originally stored as well as the intensity and duration of the activity. For this reason, athletes often try to carbohydrate load before endurance events so that carbohydrate stores are initially high and will last longer. Carbohydrate loading is fully discussed in

Using Table 4.2
, determine the approximate percentages of carbohydrate and fat used at minutes 2, 14, and 28. Check your answer in Appendix C to see whether you are correct. The early minute RER values are higher than expected for the workload, probably from hyperventilation in anticipation of the maximal effort to come in the exercise test. The last three RER values listed in Table 4.2
 are greater than 1.1 and indicate the involvement of anaerobic metabolism.






Estimation of Caloric Expenditure



Table 4.3
 not only shows the oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced when each of the energy substrates is utilized but also indicates the potential energy in terms of kilocalories per gram (kcal·g−1
) or kilocalories per liter
 of oxygen (kcal·L−1
 O2
) for each substrate. The kcal·L−1
 O2
 figures show that carbohydrates are most efficient in the use of oxygen to provide energy, followed by fat, and finally by protein—although the substrates do not really vary a great deal.



The potential energy for carbohydrate and for protein depends on whether the form is glucose (3.75 kcal·g
−1
) or glycogen (4.17 kcal·g
−1
) or all amino acids (4.3 kcal·g
−1
) or just the branched chain amino acids (3.76 kcal·g
−1
). When food is ingested, these distinctions cannot be made; the net

 average energy values are rounded to the whole numbers of 4 kcal·g
−1
 for carbohydrate and protein and 9 kcal·g
−1
 for fat. These values are called
 Atwater factors
 and are used to represent the energy potential of food. From the known values of
 

 L·min
–1
 and RER, it is possible to compute the kilocalorie (or kilojoule) energy expenditure.





Table 4.4

 includes the
 caloric equivalent
—the number of kilocalories produced per liter of oxygen consumed—for all values of RER between 0.7 and 1.0. The caloric equivalent varies from 4.686 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
 at an RER of 0.7 to 5.047 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
 at an RER of 1.0. If the amount of oxygen consumed and the caloric equivalent are known, the caloric cost of an activity can be computed.






Caloric Equivalent
 The number of kilocalories produced per liter of oxygen consumed.



Caloric Cost
 Energy expenditure of an activity performed for a specified period of time. It may be expressed as total calories (kcal), calories or kilojoules per minute (kcal·min−1 or kJ·min−1), or relative to body weight (kcal·kg−1·min−1 or kJ·kg−1·min−1).



MET
 A unit that represents the MET in multiples of the resting rate of oxygen consumption of any given activity.





To compute the kcal·min
−1
 cost, first find the caloric equivalent for the RER in
 
Table 4.4

. The rest of the computation is simply a matter of multiplying the oxygen cost by the caloric equivalent. The formula is



4.4 







EXAMPLE






Assume that an individual had an RER of 0.91 during exercise that used 2.15 LO2
·min−1
. The caloric equivalent for an RER of 0.91 is 4.936 kcal·L−1
 O2
, so the calculation becomes











This
 caloric cost
 is the energy expenditure of the activity. It may be expressed in calories or joules per minute (kcal·min
−1
 or kJ·min
−1
), relative to BW (kcal·kg
−1
·min
−1
 or kJ·kg
−1
·min
−1
), or as total calories if the calories per minute is multiplied by the total number of minutes of participation.




If you know the oxygen consumed during any activity but do not know the RER, you can estimate the caloric value of that activity by multiplying by 5.0 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
. The 5.0 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
 value is very close to the average caloric equivalent and is easy to remember. Since 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ, to convert kcal·min
−1
 to kJ·min
−1
, multiply by 4.18. For the same example as above, this is








Remember that this caloric cost is an estimate of the aerobic portion only. If we attempt to calculate the caloric cost of all 28 minutes of the incremental task, the result will be an underestimation because the anaerobic energy expenditure cannot be calculated. Furthermore, these values include what an individual would expend if he or she were resting quietly.
 Gross energy expenditure
 is the term used when resting energy expenditure is included. If resting energy expenditure is subtracted from gross energy expenditure, the
 net energy expenditure
—the energy expended to do the exercise itself—is the result. Knowing the caloric costs of activities is helpful when prescribing exercise.

A reasonable and beneficial level of exercise for fat loss is 300 kcal per session (Åstrand, 1952
). The oxygen cost of riding a bicycle ergometer at 2 Kp (600 kg·min−1
, or 100 W) at 60 rev·min−1
 is 1,200 mL O2
·min−1
 above resting metabolism. At this rate, how long must an individual ride to burn an excess of 300 kcal? Ignore the cost involved in a warm-up or cooldown. Check your answer in Appendix C.






The Metabolic Equivalent


Although most people think of energy cost in terms of kilocalories (kcal), exercise physiologists and physicians often use metabolic equivalent (MET) values. MET is an acronym derived from the term M
etabolic E
quivalenT
. One MET represents the average, seated, resting energy cost of an adult and is set at 3.5 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 of oxygen, or 1 kcal·kg−1
·hr−1
.



In reality, resting metabolic rates (RMR) vary among individuals. A 2014 examination of 197 studies reporting resting metabolic rate found that in the six earliest studies the RMR was indeed 1 kcal·kg
−1
·hr
−1
. However, the overall values were closer to 0.89 kcal·kg
−1
·hr
−1
 or 3 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 for men and 0.84 kcal·kg
−1
·hr
−1
 or 2.8 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 for women. This is an overestimation of 10–15%, respectively, and can be higher depending on age, sex, body composition, and training status (

McMurray et al., 2014

). If an individual’s resting, seated energy expenditure is known, that value can, and should, be used instead of the 3.5mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 average. Otherwise, in practice, the only

 current option is to use the traditional 3.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 of oxygen, or 1 kcal·kg
−1
·hr
−1
 with the expectation that should further research confirm the findings of this meta-analysis changes will be made in the calculated MET levels of activity. For now, it is probably best to assume that, if anything, the published MET levels will be higher than the actual MET levels for all but young (20–29 years), normal weight males and adjust individual exercise prescriptions or physical activity recommendations accordingly.




Multiples of the 1-MET resting baseline represent the
 MET
 level or multiples of the resting rate of oxygen consumption of any given activity. Thus, an activity performed at the level of 5 METs would require five times as much energy as is expended at rest (5 × 3.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 = 17.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
).




To calculate MET levels from measures of oxygen consumption, divide the amount of oxygen utilized (in mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) by 3.5. For example, if an individual expends 29 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 of O
2
 on a task, the MET level is 29 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 ÷ 3.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 = 8.3 METs.




To convert from MET to kcal·min
−1
, it is necessary to know the individual’s BW and use the relationship 1 kcal·kg
−1
·hr
−1
 = 1 MET. For example, if the 8.3-MET activity is done by a female of average weight (68 kg), the calculation is








Alternately, the formula

FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Caloric Cost and Exercise Machines






After studying exercise physiology for hours, to take a break, you go to the campus recreation center to exercise. Your goal is to burn 300 kcal, so you hop on your favorite exercise equipment, punch in your BW, select manual protocol, and begin. When the console reads 300 kcal, you stop—proud of having attained your goal. But did you really?







The answer to that question depends on a number of factors. The console number for kcal is derived mathematically from a prediction equation that typically takes into account BW and one or more measures of workload, such as stride rate, stride length, belt speed, elevation, and resistance or power output, depending on whether the equipment is a stair-stepping machine, treadmill, elliptical strider, rowing machine, or cycle ergometer. Research studies have generally shown that under identical conditions, calorie cost estimations are very consistent (reliable). However, the same cannot be said for the accuracy (validity) of the caloric cost values. For example,
 
Swain et al. (1999)

 found that an elliptical motion machine significantly overestimated caloric cost (from 39% to 79%), with the larger overestimations occurring at the higher exercise intensities. In another study on an elliptical striding machine,
 
Heselton et al. (2000)

 found that although the mean caloric cost values at two of three workloads were not significantly different, the estimated values were systematically overestimated at levels above 300 kcal for a 30-minute workout, and the percentage of individuals whose measured caloric cost fell within 30 kcal of their estimated caloric cost was only 60%, averaged over two trials. A third study using an elliptical strider by
 
Mier and Feito (2006)

 measured overestimations averaging 20–30% in caloric expenditure regardless of whether the participants used their legs only or arms and legs combined. Similar overestimations have been found for stair-stepping machines (

Riddle and Orringer, 1990

;
 
Ryan et al., 1998

), and several studies have reported that holding on to the point where part of the BW is supported results in a significant overestimation of caloric expenditure for both stair-steppers and the treadmill (

Åstrand, 1984

;
 
Butts et al., 1993

;
 
Howley et al., 1992

). The manufacturers of these machines try to provide accurate information to the exerciser, but errors are part of predictions, and the mathematical program cannot adjust if you “cheat” by holding on. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether you actually burned 300 kcal is “probably not.” Console values for caloric expenditure should be interpreted as approximations rather than absolutes, and that approximation is probably high.

Table 4.6

 presents a classification of absolute intensity ranges for physical activity in METs across fitness levels, where fitness level is defined as
 

 and is reported in METs. (Remember
 

 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 ÷ 3.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 = maximal METs.) For example, an individual with a fitness level of 8 METs should select activities between 3.8 and 5.1 METs to exercise at a moderate level.
 
Table 4.7

 classifies work intensities as a rough guide for determining how long work can be sustained at each intensity. Individuals often work at different intensities in a laboratory setting than in the natural setting, so some variation in actual MET values is to be expected (

Withers et al., 2006

). Combining the information from this table and
 
Table 4.6

, for example, shows that most indoor household chores would be considered very light to light work intensity and, theoretically, could be sustained indefinitely. Conversely, working as a Navy Seal or frogman is maximal work even for individuals with a maximal MET fitness level of 12 and can be expected to be sustained for only 1–2 hours occasionally. (Note: 12 METs = 42 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 

) Generically, sedentary behaviors are considered to be MET values less than 1.5; light-intensity activities 1.6–2.9; moderate-intensity 3–6; and vigorous 6 or more (

Ainsworth et al., 2011

). Happily we can see that sitting in class, taking notes, participating in discussions, and studying are relatively light metabolic work that can be sustained indefinitely.

Table 4.8

 presents a classification of metabolic intensities in MET values for selected physical activities. This allows an individual to find activities for any of the intensity levels for exercise found in
 
Table 4.6

. For example, on average, water skiing (6 METs) would be appropriate as a moderate activity for an individual whose
 

 is 10 or 12 METs, but not for those with lower MET max levels. Walking at 3.0 mi·hr

 (3.5 METs) would be an appropriate activity for an individual whose
 

 is 6 or 8 METs. Active video games are a new addition to the compendium selected for

 because of their

 increasing popularity for individuals of all ages and in some physical education classes. Wii Fit values have been broadly categorized together into light effort (balance and yoga) 2.3 METs and moderate effort (aerobic and resistance) 3.8 METs. A more specific breakdown the MET values of 68 Wii activities has been determined by
 
Miyachi et al. (2010)

. Forty-six activities were classified as light (<3 MET) and 22 as moderate (3–6 MET); no Wii activities were classified as vigorous (>6 MET).

Note that the compendium of MET values is intended for use with adults and probably are best applied only to young and middle-aged adults (<65 years). The absolute energy cost of walking and daily activities is higher in older adults and their resting metabolic rate is lower. Because of these factors the use of the traditional definition of a MET to estimate the metabolic cost of activities in older adults is of questionable accuracy (

Hall et al., 2014)

). There is a need for more information specific to this group. Similarly, there is a lack of comparable information for children and adolescents.
 
Ridley and Olds (2008)

 attempted to synthesize information available for these younger individuals by comparing techniques in the literature for estimating energy expenditure in children. The results provided

 evidence that using the adult MET levels was the best technique for estimating energy expenditure in children and adolescents when directly measured energy expenditure values are not available. However, resting metabolic rates vary in children from adults according to age, sex, and size but are higher, which would mean that in general MET levels are overestimated for youngsters. Thus, it would be best if adult METs could be prorated by a child-specific resting metabolic rate, either measured or estimated, but this is generally not practical.





Field Estimates of Energy Expenditure during Exercise




Metabolic Calculations Based on Mechanical Work or Standard Energy Use


In situations where an accurate assessment of mechanical work is possible, energy expenditure, expressed as oxygen consumption (mL·min−1
, mL·kg−1
·min−1
, or METs), can be estimated through a series of calculations. The equations used are based on known oxygen costs for steady-state horizontal walking (0.1 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 for each m·min−1
), horizontal running (0.2 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 for each m·min−1
), vertical rise (1.8 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 for each m·min−1
 of walking or 0.9 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 for each m·min−1
 of running), leg ergometer work against resistance (1.8 mL·kg−1
), and arm ergometer work against resistance (3 mL·kg−1
) for adults (ACSM, 2014
). These values do not include the resting metabolic rate of 1 MET or 3.5 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 of oxygen. See Appendix B for complete calculation instructions.






EXAMPLE






For an individual walking on a track at a 20 min·mi−1
 pace (3 mi·hr−1
), which is a velocity of 80.4 m·min−1
 (3 mi·hr−1
 × 26.8 m·min−1
·mi·hr−1
), the calculation is as follows:











The resultant oxygen consumption value can easily be converted to METs as previously described by dividing by 3.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
. At the 20 min·mi
−1
 pace, this is 3.3 METs.
 
Table 4.8

 shows that this is close to the actual measured value of 3.5 MET value for walking at 3 mi·hr
−1
.




These energy cost equations are useful for exercise prescription purposes in a college, health club, or clinical setting where it is not possible to directly measure energy expenditure. Physicians often prescribe exercise by MET level, assuming that the exercise leader will be able to determine the proper pace for walking or running, resistance on a cycle ergometer, or height and rate for step aerobics. The equations enable the exercise leader to do just that. Remember that the resultant values are just estimates for any given individual in any specific setting, however. Therefore, workloads should be fine-tuned using heart rate or RPE responses as described in
 
Chapter 13

Motion Sensors and Accelerometers


Attempts have been made to determine the energy cost in the field by measuring movement, assuming that more movement means greater calories expended. A familiar type of motion sensor is the pedometer (Figure 4.7
). Set to the individual’s stride length, a pedometer records the distance traveled by foot. Crouter et al. (2003)
 studied the accuracy of eight pedometers that also displayed kilocalories. It was unclear whether the pedometers were displaying net or gross kilocalories. If net kcal, the general trend was an overestimation of energy expended at every treadmill speed from 54 to 107 m·min−1
 (2–4 mi·hr−1
). If gross kcal, the accuracy of seven of the eight pedometers was within ±30% at all speeds. The authors concluded that pedometers are most accurate for measuring steps, less accurate for measuring distance, and even less accurate for assessing energy expenditure. These results were primarily supported in a 2011 study (Nielson et al., 2011
) when step counts were found to be accurate at 100, 110, and 120 steps·min−1
 but not 80 or 90 steps·min−1
, and energy expenditure was significantly underestimated at 80 steps·min−1
 but overestimated at all other stride frequencies.

 This woman is wearing a pedometer that measures step number and estimates distance and energy expenditure.





Accelerometers are portable devices worn on the body that measure movement in terms of acceleration. Speed is a change in position relative to time.
 Acceleration
 is the change in speed relative to time. The unit of measurement is typically gravitational acceleration units (
g
; 1
 g
 = 9.8 m·sec
−2
). Depending on the level of electronic sophistication, accelerometers detect acceleration(s) in one to three planes or axes (anteroposterior, mediolateral, and/or vertical). In some instances this accelerometer information is supplemented by data from Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The raw outputs of accelerometers are known as counts. These counts are processed by linear or nonlinear regression equation software to determine the estimated energy expenditure. Some newer technology uses multisensors applied to several body segments (e.g., arm, waist, and ankle) and/or combines accelerometry with physiological sensors (e.g., for heart rate, skin temperature, or body temperature) in a single device (

Chen and Bassett, 2005

;
 
Corder et al., 2007

). As with pedometers, accelerometers and GPS units often are not accurate indicators of energy expenditure/metabolic equivalents (

Hongu et al., 2013

;
 
Park et al., 2011

). Technology in pedometers and accelerometers continues to evolve in an attempt to get the best estimation of energy expenditure (Shephard and Aoyagi, 2012). Many smartphones now contain GPS units, accelerometers, gyroscope sensors, and/or databases that attempt to estimate activity energy expenditure (

Jung et al., 2012

;
 
Shih et al., 2012

). Information on the consistency (reliability) and accuracy (validity) of the various smartphone activity and energy expenditure monitors is needed.



Activity Recalls and Questionnaires


In terms of technology, the least complex system for estimating energy expenditure is a self- or observer activity report in which either all activities or just exercise sessions are recorded (Laporte et al., 1985
). The caloric cost of a particular activity or exercise session depends on the activity performed, its intensity and duration, and the individual’s BW. The caloric cost can be calculated from a chart such as the ones presented in Tables 4.7
 and
 4.8
 by converting METs to kcal·kg−1
·min−1
. 1 MET = 1 kcal·kg−1
·hr−1
; 1 kcal·kg−1
·hr−1
 ÷ 60 min·hr−1
 = kcal·kg−1
·min−1
. The following formula is used:


4.5 







EXAMPLE






If a 65-year-old, 84-kg female walks 3 mi in 1:15, how many kilocalories does she expend?







To use
 
Table 4.8

, first convert 3 mi in 1 hour and 15 minutes to mi per hour.









Table 4.8

 shows that 2.5 mi·hr
−1
 at 3.0 METs is the closest approximation. Thus, an individual walking at 2.5 mi·hr
−1
 expends 0.05 kcal·kg
−1
·min
−1
 (3.0 kcal·kg
−1
·hr
−1
 ÷ 60 min·hr
−1
 = 0.05 kcal·kg
−1
·min
−1
). Substituting into this formula:












Therefore, this individual expends 315 kcal in her walk, which is a good fitness workout

.







For an assessment of total daily energy expenditure or even weekly average expenditure, the process becomes more tedious and, as a result, is probably less exact. Even the most willing individuals have only so much time to write down everything they do; if activity is recorded after the fact, some activities will be forgotten. It is also possible that when asked to recall their activity and provide a record of that activity, some people may overestimate their energy expenditure. Typically, although estimated energy expenditure and activity patterns show large discrepancies from criterion values, questionnaires can make a broad distinction between active and sedentary individuals (Shephard and Aoyagi, 2012
).




Efficiency and Economy




Efficiency


Walk into an appliance store to buy a furnace, hot water heater, washer, dryer, air conditioner, or refrigerator and each of the choices will have a label proclaiming its efficiency rating. Brand X uses only so much electricity (for just pennies a day!) to heat 40 gallons of water, wash a load of clothes, and so on.



Down the street, the car dealer is shouting the praises of the latest midsized economy car or hybrid; it has plenty of leg room, holds five adults comfortably, and gets 35–50 mi·gallon
−1
 of gas. In each case, the concept is the same. We want to get the most output (in heating, cooling, or miles) for the least input and energy expense (electrical power, gas, or money). The same holds true for physical labor or exercise output: We want to get the most output (work) for the least input (ATP, kilocalories, or fuel used). One exception to this is probably the individual wishing to lose weight.




The human body follows the
 First Law of Thermodynamics
, also called the
 Law of Conservation of Energy
. Simply put, this law states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be changed in form. When an individual exercises or performs other external work, the actual work achieved represents only a portion of the total energy utilized. The rest of the energy appears as heat, which must be dissipated or body temperature will rise. The percentage of energy input that results in useful external work is called the
 mechanical efficiency
, or simply the efficiency of that task.






Mechanical Efficiency
 The percentage of energy input that appears as useful external work.





Efficiency can be calculated in at least three ways. The simplest calculation of efficiency is as
 gross efficiency
.



4.6 







EXAMPLE






Calculate the gross efficiency for a 22-year-old female whose BW is 65.5 kg. She has ridden a Monark cycle ergometer (flywheel distance = 6 m) at 50 rev·min−1
 with a load of 2.5 kp for 15 minutes.







The external output is calculated as work equals force times distance (W = F × D).












It takes 426.8 kg of work to equal 1 kcal. Therefore,












The amount of energy expended is calculated using
 
Equation 4.4

 and multiplying by the total time of the exercise. The average oxygen consumption for the ride was 1.73 L·min
−1
 and the RER was 0.91. At an RER of 0.91, the caloric equivalent (

Table 4.4

) is 4.936 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
. Substituting into
 
Equation 4.4

, we get












Equation
 
4.6

 can now be used to determine gross efficiency:












A slightly more complex method uses net efficiency. In
 net efficiency
, the energy expended is corrected for resting metabolic rate.



4.7 







EXAMPLE






Calculate net efficiency using the same example as for gross efficiency; this means that the individual’s resting metabolic rate (measured to be 1.11 kcal·min−1
 or 16.6 kcal for the 15 minutes) must be subtracted from the total energy expenditure of 128.09 kcal before computing for efficiency. Thus, substituting in Equation 4.7
, we get










The third technique for calculating efficiency requires the use of at least two workloads and is based on the difference between the two loads. It is called delta efficiency
.


4.8 







EXAMPLE






Calculate the delta efficiency for the 22-year-old female in the last two examples whose BW is 65.5 kg. This time she has performed two exercise stages on a treadmill, the first at 0% grade and the second at 10% grade. The speed was a constant 94 m·min−1
 (3.5 mi·hr−1
). The difference in work output is therefore primarily determined by the difference in percent grade—in this case, a 10% difference. Treadmill delta efficiency calculations are usually done on a per-minute basis. Therefore, instead of calculating the change in work (W = F × D) as in the first two examples, the change (D) in work, rate or power (P), which is work divided by time, is used (Adams et al., 1972
; Gaesser and Brooks, 1975
):











Substituting, we get












Using the conversion of 426.8 kg of work is equal to 1 kcal, we then divide 615.7 kg·min
−1
 by 426.8 kg for a difference in work output of 1.44 kcal·min
−1
.








As before, energy expenditure is calculated using
 
Equation 4.4

. The average oxygen consumption at 0% grade is 0.91 L·min
−1
 with an RER of 0.73. The caloric equivalent (

Table 4.4

) of the 0.73 RER is 4.714 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
. Substituting into
 
Equation 4.4

, this becomes












The average oxygen consumption at 10% grade was 1.75 L
−1
 O
2
, and the RER was 0.86. The caloric equivalent of an RER of 0.86 is 4.875 kcal·L
−1
 O
2
. Substituting these values into
 
Equation 4.4

 leads to












To obtain the difference in energy expended at the two workloads, simply subtract:













Equation 4.8

 can now be used to solve for delta efficiency:












When used for the same exercise modality, these different methods of calculating efficiency yield very different results. For example,
 
Gaesser and Brooks (1975)

 calculated gross efficiencies of 7.5–20.4%, net efficiencies of 9.8–24.1%, and delta efficiencies of 24.4–34% on the bicycle ergometer under the same controlled experimental conditions. Despite these differences, all these techniques are valuable because each technique is best suited for particular uses.




Gross efficiency
 is most useful for calculating values for specific workloads, speeds, or the like and is the most appropriate measure of whole body efficiency (

Noordhof et al., 2010

). For example, it answers the question: What is the efficiency of cycling into a 15 mi·hr
−1
 (24 km·hr
−1
) head wind, and how might that change with body position? Gross efficiency is also important for applications in nutritional studies where gross energy expenditure is a concern for adequate replenishment, such as during the Tour de France, when replacement is essential if a cyclist is to continue hard riding day after day. Furthermore, gross efficiency is the measure reported most frequently, making it valuable for comparison purposes (

Donovan and Brooks, 1977

). It is an extremely robust measure and does not exhibit either day-to-day or within-day circadian rhythms for the same individual, but can be different between individuals. Gross efficiency increases in a curvilinear fashion with exercise intensity (Ettema and Lorås, 2009;
 
Noordhof et al., 2010

).
 Net efficiency
 is an indication of the efficiency of work per se because it eliminates resting levels of energy that are not used to perform the work. Net efficiency implies that resting metabolic rate is independent of exercise intensity and isolated from work production. At least in cycling, this is not accurate (Ettema and Lorås, 2009). In addition, it is not a realistic value because an individual performing any external work is still expending resting energy.




Delta efficiency
 is the most accurate means for determining the effect of speed or work rate on efficiency. It indicates the relative energy cost of performing an additional increment of work. Delta efficiency is also the technique of choice for calculating efficiency on a treadmill. Its use is necessary because technically no work (calculated as force × distance) is done when the treadmill is horizontal (0% grade), despite the fact that energy is used. The reciprocal arm and leg movements cancel each other out, and there is no gain in vertical distance. If the treadmill is elevated so that an individual is walking or running up a grade, then work can be calculated.




All efficiency calculations assume a submaximal steady-state or steady-rate condition (RER < 1.0) and require that both work output and energy expenditure be expressed in the same units, typically kilocalories. The calculations may be done for the total time, as in the 15-minute bicycle ergometer ride used in the example for gross efficiency, or per unit of time, as in the per-minute calculations for the treadmill of delta efficiency. However, time can be a factor, since efficiency is generally high when a large amount of work is performed in a short period of time and low when a small amount of work is performed over a long period of time (

Stegeman, 1981

)

.




Because the same amount of physical work in any given exercise modality can cause different metabolic effects in individuals, the energy cost (


 consumption) of the activity is the deciding factor in determining efficiency (

Stegeman, 1981

).
 
Figure 4.8

 shows this basic relationship. As the energy cost ( 


 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1

-axis) increases, efficiency (% efficiency on the right
 y
-axis) decreases, and vice versa. Some of the factors that have been investigated to try and optimize efficiency for physical activities are described in the following section. Each of these could be plotted on the
 x
-axis in
 
Figure 4.8

.

 Cavanagh and Kram (1985).




Practical Application of Efficiency Information


Certain factors have been shown to change efficiency and thus can be manipulated by an individual to optimize efficiency and improve performance. For example, the optimal seat height on a bicycle at any given power output has been found to be approximately 109% of leg length. Optimal pedaling frequency at any given power output has been shown to be between 40 and 60 rev·min−1
 for trained and untrained individuals, despite the fact that trained cyclists self-select a rate closer to 90 rev·min−1
. The reason for this difference is still unknown (Kohler and Boutellier, 2005
). The higher revolutions per minute used by trained cyclists may optimize muscular forces and lower limb stresses but not metabolic efficiency (Widrick et al., 1992
). Maximal power might not be reached at a pedaling rate near the most efficient one. It may be that the optimal pedaling rate is not fixed but depends on race duration (Kohler and Boutellier, 2005
). In addition, at high values of mechanical power, the relationship between mechanical efficiency and pedaling frequency is relatively flat, so little efficiency is lost with the higher pedaling frequencies (Lazzer et al., 2011
). When the revolutions per minute are kept constant on a cycle ergometer, efficiency tends to increase from low to high workloads (Cavanagh and Kram, 1985
; Hagberg et al., 1981
; Stegeman, 1981
).



The optimal speed for walking efficiency, when distance is held constant, is between 60 and 100 m·min
−1
 (about 2.25 and 3.75 mi·hr
−1
, or 16–27 min·mi
−1
). The optimal grade for efficiency, when speed is held constant, is approximately 5% downhill (25%). The optimal stride length for efficiency, when speed is held constant, varies considerably among individuals. Most runners, however, intuitively select a stride length that is very close to optimal for themselves. Therefore, coaches who attempt to alter stride length may be harming efficiency.




Exercise efficiency values are most frequently reported in the 20–25% range. These values may be slightly higher (20–45%) if they are calculated as delta efficiencies and slightly lower (5–20%) if the activity involves air or wind resistance. Overcoming air resistance requires additional energy at all speeds of running and velocities of wind (including no wind). Therefore, in a running or cycling race, participants often draft off of (or tuck in behind) the front competitor. The first athlete must work harder than the athlete tucked behind, who does less work, hoping to save sufficient energy to put on a surge at the end of the race and pass the more fatigued front competitor or designated teammates as in an event such as the Tour de France. It has been shown (

Broker et al., 1999

) that during a team pursuit cycling race, performed at approximately 37 mi·hr
−1
 (60 km·hr
−1
), the average mechanical power was equal to 607 W in the lead position, 430 W (−29.2%) in the second position, and 389 W (−36%) in third and fourth position.




The extra energy cost due to air resistance is proportional to the velocity at which the runner is moving raised to the second power, or m·sec
2
. Assuming there is no head wind, this amounts to approximately 2% extra energy expenditure for the marathon distance, 4–8% for middle-distance events, and 8–16% for sprints at world-class speeds. Although these percentages may not sound like much, they can be the equivalent of 5 minutes for a marathoner. At high levels of competition, this is a tremendous amount of time and would make a considerable difference in the results (

Åstrand, 1952

;
 
Davies, 1980

;
 
Donovan and Brooks, 1977

;
 
Gaesser and Brooks, 1975

;
 
Pendergast et al., 1977

;
 
Pugh, 1970

). Although running against a head wind can require additional energy, and thus decrease efficiency, the reverse is not true. A tailwind never assists the runner by decreasing the energy cost proportionally.




The mechanical efficiency of cycling, whether calculated as net efficiency or delta efficiency, is similar in prepubertal children, postpubertal adolescents, and adults (

Klausen et al., 1985

;
 
Rowland, 1990

). It may be slightly reduced in older adults such that a lower pedaling frequency is more efficient for older cyclists than younger ones (

Sacchetti et al., 2010

). These similarities are true whether the calculations are based on relative (


 ) or on absolute (kg·min
−1
 or W) work rates. The similarities also hold for males and

 females although, if anything, females may be more efficient than males at the same cycling power outputs (

Bal et al., 1953

;
 
Girandola et al., 1981

;
 
Hopker et al., 2010

;
 
Sidney and Shephard, 1977

;
 
Taylor et al., 1950

). Because of the relative constancy of efficiency, cycling is a good family activity.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






The Impact of Body Posture on Cycling Efficiency






Eight junior, national, and professional male competitive cyclists performed two sets of trials after determination of their peak power output (PPO). The first set of trials consisted of three Wingate anaerobic 30-second leg tests: one seated on a Monark ergometer, one seated on his personal bike on an ascending road, and one standing on his personal bike on an ascending road. The second set of trials consisted of five sessions of 6-minute duration at 75% PPO: two seated-level cycling; two seated-uphill cycling (5.3% grade); and one standing-uphill cycling.







The data for the 30-second cycling sprints revealed that power output was lowest (603 ± 81 W) when seated on the Monark ergometer, slightly higher when seated on personal bikes (635 ± 123 W), but highest in the standing position (803 ± 103 W)—a difference of 20–30%, respectively, over the two seated power outputs. These results clearly show an advantage in short-term power output in short sprints for the standing position.








Data from the second set of trials are presented in the table below.








Remember that the power output was held constant at 75% PPO. Despite this constancy, both velocity and cadence were significantly lower in both uphill conditions. However, neither gross efficiency nor economy changed by either terrain (level or uphill) or body position (seated or standing).








The researchers concluded that there is an advantage for the cyclist to stand during short high-intensity hill climbs but to remain seated in longer steady-state climbs. However, which combination of speed and hill gradient favors climbing in the standing position remains to be determined.

Economy of Walking and Running


As discussed earlier, the calculation of efficiency is a ratio of work output to energy expenditure input. However, measuring external work output may be impossible in many activities such as horizontal walking and running on the treadmill. Consequently, the energy expended to move mass or oxygen cost is often used alone for walking and running as a measure of economy, not efficiency.



Economy
 is the oxygen cost of any activity, but particularly walking or running at varying speeds. The relationship between oxygen cost and economy is inverse.

 That is, the more oxygen utilized in an activity, the lower the economy of that activity. This is similar to the concept that the more gas used to go any given distance at any given speed, the less economical the car.






Economy
 The oxygen cost of any activity, but particularly walking or running at varying speeds.





The most basic generalization about economy is that, over a wide range of velocities of walking or running, the energy cost (in mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 of O
2
) is rectilinearly related to the speed (in m·min
−1
). That is, higher speeds are less economical, albeit only slightly so (

Lacour and Bourdin, 2015

). This generalization is true at least at 0% grade on a treadmill when the speed can be accomplished at a submaximal steady-state level (

Costill, 1986

;
 
Lacour and Bourdin, 2015

).
 
Figure 4.9

 shows this fundamental relationship. The black lines were computed from the equations recommended by the ACSM (2014). These equations, in turn, are based on a compilation of research. Note that the relationship between speed and oxygen consumption is not a continuous straight line encompassing both walking (

Figure 4.9A

) and running (

Figure 4.9B

). For walking speeds between approximately 50 and 100 m·min
−1
, each m·min
−1
 adds 0.1 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 above resting to the cost of the walk; for running speeds above 134 m·min
−1
, the increment is 0.2 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
. Speeds between 100 and 134 m·min
−1
 are awkward for most people because they are too fast to walk but too slow to run. Additionally, outdoor running over ground is probably more demanding in terms of oxygen cost than indoor running on the treadmill at any given velocity, although overground inclined running equals the oxygen cost of treadmill-grade running (

Daniels, 1985

;
 
Morgan et al., 1989b

).










FIGURE 4.9
 The Economy of Walking and Running for Children versus Adults.
 The oxygen cost (expressed as 
 mL·kg−1
·min−1
) of walking (A)
 and running (B)
 increases rectilinearly as velocity increases. However, the slopes of the two lines are different, and the lines are not continuous from slow walking to fast running. Prepubertal males and prepubertal females are less economical than adult males and females as indicated by the higher oxygen cost at each and every velocity. Sources
:
 ACSM (2014); Rowland et al. (1987); Rowland and Green (1988).





For any given individual, running economy appears to be relatively stable if environmental, equipment, and testing factors (such as body temperature, air resistance, footwear, time of day, and training status) are controlled (

Morgan et al., 1989b

). Day-to-day variations from 1.6% to 11% have been reported in the literature for well-trained and elite male runners. On the other hand, differences among individuals in terms of running economy are often extensive, ranging from 20% to 30%, in subjects of equal training and performance status. Highly trained individuals, however, do exhibit better running economy than do untrained or lesser trained individuals. The precise reason for these observations has not been determined (

Conley and Krahenbuhl, 1980

;
 
Daniels, 1985

;
 
McCann and Higginson, 2008

) but a complex interplay between physiological and biomechanical factors is probably responsible (Barnes and Kilding, 2015;
 
Lacour and Bourdin, 2015

;
 
Moore et al., 2012

;
 
Santos-Concejero et al., 2014

;
 
Tartaruga et al., 2012

).



Male-Female Differences in Economy


The influence of sex on variations among individuals in economy is unclear (Lacour and Bourdin, 2015
). Different studies report that males expend more energy (Figure 4.9
, green lines), less energy, or the same amount of energy in walking and running as do females (Figure 4.9
, gold lines) when values are expressed relative to body mass (per kilogram of body weight). What is clear is that even if the oxygen cost is equal at any given speed,
 females, who typically have a lower 

, will be working at a higher 

 than will males (Åstrand, 1956
; Barnes et al., 2014
; Bhambhani and Singh, 1985
; Bransford and Howley, 1977
; Bunc and Heller, 1989
; Cunningham, 1990
; Daniels, 1985
; Morgan et al., 1989b
). This fact has implications for the pace at which long-distance events can be run.



Studies on sex differences in economy in children and adolescents are more or less equally divided between those showing no sex differences and those showing girls with a higher economy (lower
 

 cost). No study has indicated that boys have a higher economy than do girls (

Rowland, 2005

).

Wheelchair Propulsion Economy






Twelve able-bodied male participants (without prior preferences for frequency or strategy for wheelchair propulsion) completed four 5-minute exercise bouts at 32 W (52%) in a randomized design on a basketball wheelchair ergometer. The purpose was to examine physiological responses to two selected push frequencies (40 and 70 push·min−1
) completed using either a synchronous (SYN) push strategy (both arms working simultaneously) or asynchronous (ASY) strategy (arms working alternately).







Results indicated that the SYN 40 condition was 9% more economical than the ASY 70, 12% more economical than the SYN 70 (
P
 < 0.01), and 13% more economical than ASY 40 (
P
 < 0.01). Heart rate values showed that the SYN 40 condition was significantly less stressful than all other conditions, and lactate concentrations were lower in both 40-push conditions as opposed to 70-push conditions. It was concluded that low push frequency combined with SYN arm motion provides the most economical form of wheelchair propulsion.

Economy in Children and Adolescents


Age has a clear-cut effect on economy in youths. Ample evidence shows that children and adolescents are less economical than adults when running/walking over a wide range of set external speeds, when economy is expressed as 

 mL·kg−1
·min−1
 (Asmussen, 1981
; Daniels, 1985
; Girandola et al., 1981
; Larish et al., 1987
; Lacour and Bourdin, 2015
; Morgan et al., 1989b
; Robinson et al., 1976
; Rowland, 2005
; Rowland and Green, 1988
; Rowland et al., 1987
, 1988
; Van de Walle et al., 2010).




Figure 4.9A and B

 shows the results of two studies conducted in the same laboratory in which male prepubertal children (aged 9–13 years) were compared with adult males (aged 23–33 years) (

Rowland et al., 1987

) and female prepubertal children (aged 8–12 years) were compared with adult females (aged 22–35 years) (

Rowland et al., 1988

) and how the four groups compared to the theoretical computed oxygen consumption values. In both sexes, the energy cost at all speeds of running was higher for children than adults relative to body mass. Males were not tested for walking, but in females, at 80 m·min
−1
, there was no apparent walking economy difference with age. The differences at the running speeds held true whether expressed as an absolute load (m·min
−1
) or relative load. The adult values were much closer to the calculated values than the children’s, indicating that the equations should not be used for children.





Figure 4.10A and B

 shows that children and adolescents differ in economy of running not only from adults but also from each other by sex and age (

Åstrand, 1952

). Indeed, there is a progressive decline in oxygen cost (progressive increase in economy) from the youngest (4–6 years) to the oldest (16–17 years) age groups in both boys and girls. A compilation of studies shows the decline in oxygen cost to be about 2% per year from 8 to 18 years when the same work is performed (

Morgan et al., 1989b

). Similar data are available for both boys and girls walking at 80–100 m·min
−1
 at increasing grades. These changes are evident from cross-sectional studies in which

 different individuals are tested at each age and in longitudinal studies of the same individuals at different ages (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Costill, 1986

;
 
Daniels et al., 1978

). The available data indicate that the oxygen cost of walking/running at any given speed decreases on average by 1.0 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 per year (

Rowland, 2005

).

 and female (B)
 children age. This can be seen by the almost parallel and successively lower mL·kg−1

 values across the tested velocities of running. Source

There has been much speculation about the cause of this low economy in children. Five factors known to be affected by growth may offer at least a partial explanation.




1.
 High basal metabolic rate
. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum level of energy required to sustain the body’s vital functions in a waking state, as measured by oxygen consumption. BMR is highest in young children and progressively declines to adulthood, where it stabilizes until it again declines in old age (

Rowland, 1990

) (see
 
Figures 4.11

 and
 
8.4

 in
 
Chapter 8

). Thus, gross exercise oxygen consumption values may be higher in children than in adults because resting metabolic rates are higher (

Lacour and Bourdin, 2015

).
 
Bar-Or (1983)

 has pointed out that this difference in resting metabolism is only 1–2 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 and, although this value represents a 25–35% greater BMR in children than in adults, it alone is unlikely to account for all of the difference in submaximal exercise values. Indeed, when
 
Åstrand (1952)

 used net oxygen values instead of gross (by subtracting the BMR), the difference between the age groups was reduced but not eliminated. Thus, the use of net, not gross, values is better when interpreting oxygen consumption of walking/running for children and adolescents (Van de Walle et al., 2010)

.




2.
 Large surface area/mass ratio
. Throughout the animal kingdom, smaller animals (such as mice, squirrels, rabbits, or the young of any species) have higher resting metabolic rates per unit of body mass than do larger animals (dogs, horses, elephants, or the adults of any species). However, when the unit of comparison is not body mass (per kilogram) but body surface area (per square meter), metabolic rates are similar. This is called the
 surface law
. The surface law appears to be important for the maintenance of normal core temperatures, as body heat loss is directly related to surface area: The larger the surface area, the greater the heat loss. Smaller individuals, as is typically true of the young, have greater surface areas per unit of mass than do larger individuals. Therefore, a higher resting metabolic rate is necessary to maintain body temperature in a smaller (younger) person. This phenomenon may be the reason for the elevated BMR in the young (

Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland and Green, 1988

;
 
Rowland et al., 1987

). When Rowland and colleagues (

Rowland et al., 1988

,
 
1987

,
 
2005

) changed the unit of comparison from mL·kg
−1

 to mL·m

, the differences between the prepubertal and adult subjects of both sexes were no longer significant and were almost eliminated.




3.
 Immature running mechanics
. Watching a young child and an adult run together reveals obvious differences in motor skill (

Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland et al., 1987

). Young children seem to take numerous small, choppy steps involving lots of extraneous movements. At the same speed as an adult, the child has a higher stride frequency; a shorter stride length; a greater vertical displacement; increased ankle, knee, and hip extension at takeoff; increased cocontraction of antagonistic muscles; a longer nonsupport phase; and a shorter placement of the support foot in front of the center of gravity—all costly in terms of oxygen.




4.
 Body size.
 The variable that seems to have the most direct effect on the oxygen cost of running is stride frequency and stride frequency is related to body size. Each stride requires energy to accelerate and decelerate the body’s mass. Per stride, the oxygen cost is the same in children and adults. Similarly, when speed is adjusted for body size using a leg length per second (LL·sec
−1
) unit, children and adults are equally economical (

Maliszewski and Freedson, 1996

). However, at any given pace, the child has a greater frequency of strides simply because he or she is anatomically smaller. Thus, more oxygen is utilized (indicating lower economy) to provide the greater energy need (

Rowland et al., 1987

, 2005). During typical daily physical activities, children and adults do not exercise at the same workload, but at a metabolic rate that is scaled to their body size. In these daily self-paced physical activities, unlike identical external loads such as miles per hour speed, children are not less energy economical than adults (

Rowland, 2012

).

Remember that each individual intuitively selects the most economical combination of stride frequency and length for running. Therefore, one should not attempt to “make” children more economical by training them to lengthen their strides. Stride frequency decreases and stride length increases naturally as the child grows.




5.
 Less efficient ventilation
. The volume of air breathed in to consume 1 L of oxygen is called the
 ventilatory equivalent
 (
VE
). Children have a higher VE than do adults. The processing of this additional air requires an added expenditure of energy. This increased metabolic cost of respiration may account for part of the increased oxygen cost at submaximal work in children, although not all research evidence agrees (

Allor et al., 2000

;
 
Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland and Green, 1988

;
 
Rowland et al., 1987

,
 
1988

).




6.
 Lower anaerobic capacity
. As discussed in the preceding chapter, children are less able to generate ATP anaerobically than are adults. The measurement of economy by oxygen consumption evaluates only the aerobic energy contribution. It is possible that at higher, but still submaximal, workloads, adults provide more of the required energy anaerobically and thus exhibit artificially low oxygen cost values (Armstrong et al., 2015;
 
Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland et al., 1987

). Evidence from RER values supports this contention. Children typically show lower RERs during submaximal exercise than do adults. Direct measurement of free fatty acid and glycerol levels shows, however, that the lower RERs are not the result of an increased utilization of fat as a fuel as might be expected. Instead, the lower RERs are thought to result from lower amounts of nonmetabolic “excess CO
2
,” that is, the CO
2
 generated from the buffering of lactic acid.

Economy in Older Adults


Economy in older adults appears to be higher than that in children, approximately equal to that in adolescents, and lower than that in young adults (McCann and Adams, 2002
). The difference from young adults in oxygen cost has been observed to be anywhere from 8% to 31% (Malatesta et al., 2003
; Martin et al., 1992
; McCann and Adams, 2002
; Mian et al., 2006
; Ortega and Farley, 2007
).



As with children, the cause of the increased oxygen cost (lower economy) at any given speed of walking is unknown, although, unlike with children, there does not appear to be a size component (

McCann and Adams, 2002

). Mechanistic ideas about the difference include the following:




1.
 Recruitment of additional motor units
. Aging brings a decline in the force-generating capacity of muscle. This may require the recruitment of additional motor units, including a higher proportion of less economical fast-twitch muscle fibers. More motor units require more oxygen to produce ATP (

Martin et al., 1992

).




2.
 Gait instability
. Increased gait instability (based on stride time) and a greater energy expenditure needed

 to maintain balance during such instability have both been suggested as causes for the greater oxygen cost of walking in older adults. However, although
 
Malatesta et al. (2003)

 found both greater stride time variability in 65-year-old and 80-year-old individuals and lower economy compared with 25-year-old individuals, these two variables were not significantly correlated. They concluded that the metabolic cost of the static contraction involved in maintaining balance was negligible.




3.
 Antagonistic cocontraction
. Cocontraction or coactivation means that there is contraction or activation of antagonist muscles during agonist action. Excessive coactivation causes joint stiffening, limits range of movement, and may partly explain the elevated oxygen cost of walking in older adults. Again, more muscles require more oxygen for the production of ATP (

Malatesta et al., 2003

;
 
Mian et al., 2006

).



Practical Application of Economy Information


Economy and efficiency probably matter little in high-intensity, short-term activities such as maximal weight lifts and sprints or in skilled movements such as golf. However, economy is extremely important in endurance events. Among those factors critical for success in endurance performances are a high 

, the ability to work at a high 

 aerobically (sometimes measured as a high 

 at LT1 [first lactate threshold]), and a high economy measured as a low submaximal oxygen cost at high velocities (Almarwaey et al., 2003
; Conley and Krahenbuhl, 1980
; Costill, 1986
; Costill et al., 1973
; Cunningham, 1990
; Morgan et al., 1989a
,b
; Saunders et al., 2004
). What may matter most to competitive runners is a combination of economy and 

 known as velocity at 

 (

).



Although a high
 

 is considered to be a prerequisite for success in distance or endurance events, it generally does not determine performance when participants are relatively homogeneous in that trait. For example,
 
Costill (1986)

 presents data from two runners (Ted Corbitt and Jim McDonagh) who had similar
 

 values (64 and 65 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
). Over a period of 2 years, they competed against each other in 15 major races, and the same runner (McDonagh) won each and every time! Obviously, the physiological explanation did not lie in
 

.




The importance of the ability to sustain a high percentage of
 

 aerobically for long periods of time is exemplified by the success of such runners as Grete Waitz (first woman to run a marathon in under 2:30, winner of NY City Marathon 9 times), Frank Shorter (1972 Olympic Marathon gold medallist, 1976 Olympic Marathon silver medallist), and Derek Clayton (first marathoner to run under 2:10) (

Costill, 1986

). These world-class runners were estimated to use 85–90%
 

 when they competed in marathons, whereas less successful marathoners average about 75–80%
 

. Typically, such a high percentage (85–90%) can be maintained only for a shorter (10 mi or less) distance. By continuing at that rate over twice as long as normal, these individuals gained a competitive edge. A 2010 study (McLaughlin et al.) showed that when there was little variability in the
 

 at LT1 during a 16-km race it (


 at LT1) did not explain distance running ability, similar to the situation that when
 

 was homogeneous it (


) did not explain endurance performance. However, the velocity (m·min
−1
) at LT1 was highly correlated with the 16-km run time.




The importance of a high running economy is seen in several situations. If two runners of widely varying
 

 (runner A = 65 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
; runner B = 50 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) but similar economy attempt to train together, say at an 8-minute pace ( 


 cost = 40 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
), runner B would be working much harder (80%
 

) than runner A (62%
 

). This variation in effort often occurs when females (average lower
 

, equal economy) run with males.




Differences in economy have a similar effect on performance. If, for example, runner A and runner B had the same
 

 (65 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) but widely varying economies at an 8-minute pace (runner A = 55 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
; runner B = 40 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
), then runner A would be working much harder (85%
 

) than runner B (62%
 

). This is the likely reason why McDonagh (above) continually beat Corbitt in their races. At all velocities faster than 8 min·mi
−1
, Corbitt used significantly more oxygen than did McDonagh (

Costill, 1986

). Corbitt could have won only by making up the difference by running at a higher %
 

.




A similar situation occurs when a child (on average, equal in
 

 [in mL·kg·min
−1
] to an adult but lower in economy) runs with an adult as seen in
 
Figure 4.12

. At any given speed, the child (unless there is a great disparity in his or her favor for
 

) will be working harder than the adult. Although it is important for parents and teachers to encourage children to be active and for adults to do activities with children, the fact that the child will be working proportionally harder at any given running pace must be taken into account. The parent or teacher

 should match the child’s pace or encourage just a slightly faster pace—not try to make the child keep up with what the adult finds comfortable. As a consequence, the adult will have to do his or her hard training without the child along, but the child will enjoy the experience much more. Since there appears to be little difference in efficiency in cycling as a function of sex or age as long as the wheel sizes are equal (allowing the same revolutions per minute), cycling may be a better family activity than running.

CASE STUDY 3






The Fitt family plans to run the Cornfest 10-km (6.2 mi) race together. Dr. Phyllis Fitt, the mother, is an exercise physiologist and recently tested all family members in her lab. Given the following information, what is the fastest time they can run with a reasonable chance of everyone finishing in good shape together?











Hint
:
 Competitive runners typically average 80–90% during distance races of 5–10 mi; fun runners might be expected to be at the lower end of this value.







As stated previously, what may matter most to competitive runners is the combination of economy and
 

 known as velocity at
 

 (


).
 Velocity at
 

 is the speed at which an individual can run when working at his or her
 

 based on both submaximal running economy and
 

.
 
Table 4.9

 and
 
Figure 4.13

 show how this value is calculated and what it means. To calculate
 

,
 

 values (
y
-axis) are plotted at several submaximal speeds (
x
-axis) for each individual, and a regression line—a line that best fits the
 

 values—is established. The line is extended to reach the individual’s measured
 

. The speed (or velocity) at which the
 

 occurs is then determined by dropping a perpendicular line from the
 

 point to the
 x
-axis. This velocity is taken as the velocity at
 

 (


). As the figure shows, it is possible to achieve the same
 

 with a high economy (low energy cost at submaximal speeds) and a low
 

 (subject A) or with a low economy (high energy cost at submaximal speeds) and a high
 

 (subject B). Individuals such as these two with a similar
 

 would be expected to have similar performances in endurance running events (

Bird, 1991

;
 
Morgan et al., 1989a

). All other factors (such as
 

) being relatively equal, an individual with a high
 

 would be expected to perform better than an individual with a low
 

 (

Almarwaey et al., 2003

;
 
Kilding et al., 2006

;
 
McLaughlin et al., 2010

;
 
Sirotic and Coutts, 2007

).

Velocity at 

 The speed at which an individual can run when working at his or her maximal oxygen consumption, based on both submaximal running economy and 
.






The highest speed attained at the end of a graded exercise test with horizontal running can be used to predict performance, especially in a marathon, because it appears to reflect the physiological variables involved in
 

 (

McLaughlin et al., 2010

). A recent study has shown that is it possible to get a good estimate of
 

 in adult males and females from performance of the PACER 20-m shuttle test. The equation is
 

; where
 x
 = number of shuttles completed.




This equation accounts for 87% of the variance between measured and predicted values (

Paradisis et al., 2014

).




The low economy of children at any given external pace may help explain another phenomenon. Typically, endurance performance as measured by treadmill time to fatigue, PACER distance, mile-run time, and so on, improves in children with age despite a constant
 

. Furthermore,

 although young athletes generally have
 

 values higher than those of nonathletes, when training programs are undertaken, endurance performance often improves exclusively—or at least more than does
 

. Increases in body size that allows longer stride length and hence improved skill; age improvements in qualitative changes in oxygen delivery (not indicated by
 

); and/or the improvement of anaerobic strength and neurological function in the long term probably account for the enhanced endurance performances regardless of what occurs with
 

 (

Rowland, 2013

). Submaximal running economy in relation to a given external pace has been found to be statistically related to and to account for much of the variance in endurance performance in children and adolescents in most (but not all) studies. Since
 

 remains relatively stable and the O
2
 cost of any given speed decreases, the child is working at a progressively lower percentage of
 

; as he or she ages. The individual is therefore expected to perform (endure) at the same speed for a longer period of time, cover more ground in the same time span, and/or increase the speed at which any given distance is covered (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Burkett et al., 1985

;
 
Daniels and Oldridge, 1971

;
 
Daniels et al., 1978

Mayers and Gutin, 1979

;
 
McCormack et al., 1991

;
 
Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland et al., 1988

).




Finally, for all the reasons discussed here, one cannot use adult prediction equations based on
 

/speed relationships to predict
 

 in children.





SUMMARY





1.
 Aerobic metabolism can be measured directly by calorimetry (the measurement of heat production) or indirectly by spirometry (the measurement of air breathed and the analysis of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases). Typically, open-circuit indirect spirometry/open-circuit indirect calorimetry is used.




2.
 During aerobic exercise, the amount of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced increases. In a short-term submaximal activity, the metabolic costs level off where the energy requirements are met. This activity is called steady-state or steady-rate submaximal exercise.




3.
 If a submaximal exercise lasts for a long time, is above approximately 70%
 

, or takes place under hot and humid conditions, oxygen drift occurs. The oxygen consumption drifts upward owing to rising levels of catecholamines, lactate, and body temperature as well as an increasing cost of ventilation and a shift in substrate utilization.




4.
 During incremental exercise to maximum, oxygen consumption rises in a rectilinear pattern proportional to the workload increments until the individual can increase oxygen utilization no more and a plateau occurs. The highest amount of oxygen an individual can take in, transport, and utilize during heavy exercise is called maximal oxygen consumption (


).




5.
 Very short, high-intensity anaerobic exercise and static and dynamic resistance activity are predominantly anaerobic activities. The oxygen contribution to the energy cost rarely exceeds one fourth to one half of the total energy cost but is a meaningful amount.




6.
 On the cellular level, the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed is termed the respiratory quotient; as analyzed from expired air, it is termed the respiratory exchange ratio. Nonprotein RER is used most frequently in determining energy substrate utilization, with 0.7 being interpreted as fat, 1.0 as carbohydrate, and 0.85 as an approximate 50–50 mixture of both.




7.
 During exercise, the higher the intensity, the higher the RER value. During long-duration submaximal exercise, RER may decrease as the carbohydrate stores are depleted. During incremental exercise to maximum, RER may increase above 1.0, reflecting carbon dioxide increases from nonmetabolic sources. RERs for high-intensity static exercise and dynamic resistance exercise are between 0.8 and 1.0+, reflecting a mixed fuel supply during the static activity followed by hyperventilation and a reliance on glycogen during the dynamic resistance activity.




8.
 Given the amount of oxygen consumed, the RER during the same time span, and the caloric equivalent, caloric expenditure (kcal·min
−1
) and metabolic equivalents (METs) can be calculated.




9.
 Energy expenditure can be estimated in field settings using a series of metabolic formulas, motion sensors/accelerometers, or activity recall questionnaires and previously established caloric cost charts with varying degrees of accuracy.




10.
 Mechanical efficiency (gross, net, or delta) is some ratio of work output to energy expended. Economy is simply a measure of energy expended (oxygen consumed); it is used when measuring work output

 is difficult. Energy cost and economy are inversely related. Because the energy cost of walking and running is rectilinear over a wide range of speed, oxygen cost or MET values can be estimated when speed is known.




11.
 Variation in running economy is high between individuals but is low within the same individual. No clear-cut distinction in running economy has been shown between females and males. Children and adolescents are less economical than adults when running over a wide range of set speeds but not in self-paced activity. Older individuals are less economical when walking than young and middle-aged adults.




12.
 The exact reason why children are less economical than adults is unknown, but one or more of the following characteristics of children may be involved:




a.
 A higher basal metabolic rate




b.
 A larger surface area/mass ratio




c.
 Immature running mechanics




d. Smaller bodies that result in shorter stride length and higher stride frequency




e. Less efficient ventilation




f. Lower anaerobic capacity




13.
 The exact reason why older adults are less economical than younger adults is unknown, but the following factors have been considered possibilities:




a.
 Recruitment of additional motor units




b.
 Gait instability




c.
 Antagonistic cocontraction




14.
 A high economy (low oxygen cost) at any given velocity of running is beneficial to performance, especially when combined with a high
 

 and the ability to work consistently at a high percentage of
 

 aerobically (high percentage of
 

 at LT1). The higher the velocity at
 

 and the greater the percentage of
 

 an individual can maintain, the better his or her performance will be. Improvements in size and set pace running economy may explain why, as they grow and/or train, children typically improve in endurance-run performance (such as the mile run) but do not show as much improvement in
 

 as adults.
