Compare a balanced diet for sedentary individuals with a balanced diet for active individuals in terms of caloric intake; carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake; and vitamin, mineral, and fluid requirements.






Discuss the positive and negative aspects of a high-carbohydrate diet.






Explain the glycemic index; identify common high-, moderate-, and low-glycemic foods; and explain the best use of each classification. Describe a training situation when fat intake can be too low.






Compare the theory of carbohydrate loading for endurance athletes to its use for body builders.






Compare the 1-week and short techniques of carbohydrate loading in terms of diet and exercise for endurance event competitors.






Develop a pre-event meal plan for athletic competition.

Differentiate among the eating disorders anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia athletica in terms of definitions and characteristics.






Identify the risk factors for developing an eating disorder.






Construct guidelines to help prevent or manage eating disorders in exercise settings.








Introduction





Proper nutrition and exercise are natural partners for health, fitness, and athletic performance. Consequently, many fitness enthusiasts pursue healthy diets, and athletes try to optimize their performance by implementing appropriate diets. Although these are very positive trends, they also have the potential to be taken to an extreme, which may simply involve spending money needlessly on “nutritional supplements” or may actually be harmful, as with eating disorders. It is the responsibility of all physical educators, athletic personnel, rehabilitation clinicians, and fitness professionals to understand what constitutes optimal nutrition for fitness and athletics.



Nutrition education should be a part of physical fitness classes, community adult fitness and rehabilitation programs, and athletic training. Most individuals who train regularly want to eat right, but they may confuse advertisements and media hype with factual information.




Optimal nutrition for fitness and athletics must be considered for two different situations. The first is training, and the second is competition, whether on the “fun run” fitness or elite competitive level. With the exception of some youth sports, individuals typically spend more total time training than competing, making daily nutritional practices critical. No amount of dietary manipulation the day of or the day before a competition can make up for otherwise poor nutritional habits (

Burke and Read, 1989

).





Nutrition for Training




Individuals in exercise training need to match their training regimen with an appropriate diet. This often involves consultation with a fitness professional, a complete diet analysis by a nutritionist, and, many times, a trial-and-error approach to find what works best for a given individual
.



The goals of an optimal training diet are to:




1.
 Provide caloric and nutrient requirements




2.
 Incorporate nutritional practices that promote good health




3.
 Achieve and maintain optimal body composition and competition weight




4.
 Promote recovery from training sessions and physiological adaptations




5.
 Try variations of precompetition and competition fuel and fluid intake to determine the body’s responses (

Burke and Read, 1989

)




There is almost universal agreement that poor nutritional status impairs work performance. There is also considerable, although not universal, agreement that good general nutrition (the balanced diet recommended for just about everyone, as shown in
 
Table 6.1

) is adequate and probably even optimal for most active individuals as well as sedentary individuals.






TABLE 6.1
 Balanced Diets






*Note: the 2015 Dietary Guidelines no longer include a recommended limit on cholesterol intake or the total fat level for adults. However, the natural limit for total fat, if individuals are following a healthy dietary pattern, should be in the 32–34% range.



†
The RDA value of 130 g·d−1
 is based on the amount of carbohydrate needed for brain function; the % is based on the role of carbohydrate as an energy source to maintain body weight.



‡
Total water includes drinking water, water in beverages, and water that is a part of food.

Unfortunately, a typical American does not eat the recommended healthy balanced diet. If the recommended percentages from a healthy variety of foods are consumed, the vast majority of youth sport, middle and secondary school, and college athletes, as well as fitness participants of all ages, will not need any modification in their diet. For those athletes or fitness participants training very long, hard, and often competing at an elite level, a few modifications may be beneficial (

Table 6.1

 summarizes these recommendations, which are discussed in the following sections.




The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) food icon, called MyPlate (

Figure 6.1

), symbolizes healthy nutrition. The Canadian version, the Eat Well Plate, is very similar but places both a container of water and a drop for oils and fat outside of the actual plate (

Health Canada

). There are four primary messages to the ChooseMyPlate campaign (

ChooseMyPlate.gov

):










FIGURE 6.1
 Food Guide for Sedentary and Active Individuals.
 This plate icon from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) emphasizes that one half of your plate should be filled with fruits and vegetables, with whole grains and lean protein on the other half. Low-fat dairy on the side is also suggested. The Web site MyPlate.gov offers resources for both individuals and professionals teaching others about the concepts based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
 to help meet nutrient and caloric needs and make positive eating choices. Source:

.





1.
 Build a healthy plate that is filled one half with fruits and vegetables and the other half with whole grains and lean protein; add a side of low-fat dairy.




2.
 Cut back on foods high in solid fats, added sugars, and salt (SoFAS).




3.
 Eat the right amount of calories for you.




4.
 Be physically active your way.




The intent is that individuals will be consuming a diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts; includes low- and nonfat dairy products, poultry, seafood, and nontropical vegetable oils; and limits sodium, saturated fat, refined grains, added sugar, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, and red and processed meats (

USDA, Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS), 2015

). Individuals are encouraged to go to
 
www.choosemyplate.gov

, create a profile, and obtain a daily physical activity target and nutrition plan based on age, sex, height, current weight, and current physical activity. For example, for a 21-year-old female who is 5'8" tall and weighs 145 lb, the food recommendations would be 8 oz. of grains, 3 cups of vegetables, 2 cups of fruit, 3 cups of dairy, 6.5 oz. of protein, and 7 tsp of oil. This would leave approximately 330 kcal of empty calories that could be ingested from the limit list of solid fats and added sugars. For a male, the only changes are that he is allotted 9 oz. of grains, 3.5 cups of vegetables, 8 tsp of oil, and approximately 362 empty calories. Fruit, dairy, and protein amounts remain the same. Each plan gives examples of what foods count as that category and tips to help make healthy choices. If you have not yet visited this Web site, it might be an interesting exercise to do. Information for professionals is also included on the Web site.





Figure 6.2

 shows the usual intake in a typical American diet as a percent of goal or limit recommendations and how far typical Americans are from eating the recommended healthy balanced diet. Even more disconcerting are the top five sources of calories among Americans. These are, for 2- to 18-year-olds, grain-based desserts, pizza, soda/energy/sports drinks, yeast breads, and chicken and chicken-mixed dishes. For individuals 19+, they are grain-based desserts, yeast breads, chicken and chicken-mixed dishes,

 soda/energy/sports drinks, and alcoholic beverages. Pizza is number six (

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010

). How does your diet compare? The Focus on Application box provides information on nutrition label information that can be useful in developing a balanced diet.

Kilocalories


The most obvious dietary distinction between active and inactive individuals is the number of calories required per day. Everyone needs sufficient calories to support their daily needs, and children need adequate calories for growth. In addition, an active individual can expend several hundred to several thousand kilocalories more per day than a sedentary individual. The actual amount depends on the individual’s size and the intensity, duration, and frequency of the workouts. For example, large football players doing two-a-day workouts and an endurance athlete of any size expend a large amount of calories, but golfers or softball and baseball players of any size expend much smaller amounts (ACSM et al., 2009
; ADA, 1987
; Brotherhood, 1984
; Burke and Read, 1989
; Kreider et al., 2010
; Leaf and Frisa, 1989
). Costill (1988)
 cites figures of 900–2,400 kcal·d−1
 expended in activity for elite distance runners, 6,000 kcal·d−1
 for cyclists, and 1,250–3,750 kcal·d−1
 for swimmers during training. These calories must be replaced.



Published reports indicate that male basketball and football players may consume as many as 9,000– 11,000 kcal·d
−1
, triathletes 3,500–6,400 kcal·d
−1
 (female and male), cross-country skiers 4,000–5,500 kcal·d
−1
 (female and male), and track and field athletes (male) 3,500–4,700 kcal·d
−1
, depending on the event. It is highly likely that these athletes are adequately resupplying their energy needs (

Burke and Read, 1989

).




However, competitors in other sports (long-distance running, gymnastics, wrestling, and dance) often attempt to maintain extremely low and, in some cases, “unnatural” body fat and body weight. Intake values as low as 600 kcal·d
−1
 for male gymnasts and 900 kcal·d
−1
 for female ballet dancers have been reported. It is likely that these athletes are not adequately resupplying their energy needs (

Burke and Read, 1989

).





Table 6.2

 presents caloric needs based on estimated energy requirements (EER) and activity levels for males and females from 2 to 76+ years. The EER is the average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain

 energy balance consistent with good health, that is, with a BMI of 18.5–25 kg·m
−2
 and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Note that there are separate columns for sedentary, moderately active, and active individuals. The caloric values in
 
Table 6.2

 should be sufficient for most individuals engaging in physical activity for health and fitness.

 Estimated Calorie Needs per Day by Age, Sex, and Physical Activity Level

 at 3–4 mi·hr−1
 in addition to daily activities.

If the relative proportion of nutrients obtained from a healthy diet remains the same as the calories are increased to support training, the active individual would have an acceptable diet. However, some subtle shifting of percentages and/or amounts can be of benefit in certain situations. Chief among them is an increased percentage of carbohydrate ingestion for endurance athletes.







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Food Label Interpretation






The dietary recommendations presented in Table 6.1
 are expressed as percentages and g·kg−1
·d−1
. Information about both of these measures can be obtained from
 reading the “Nutrition Facts” label found on most foods. Content of these labels is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the spring of 2016, the FDA approved changes to this label. The accompanying figure shows both the old label and the newly approved one.







Serving size is expressed in familiar units such as cups, containers, or pieces and grams. Current serving sizes have been used since 1990 (based on data collected between 1977 and 1988), and it is the position of the FDA that they no longer reflect the amount of food people typically consume at one sitting. For example, the old serving size for ice cream is ½ cup while the newly approved amount is 1 cup. While this increase in serving size may be more realistic, it could also be problematic. A recent study (

Dallas et al., 2015

) showed that most individuals believe that serving size indicates how much food can or should be consumed in one sitting as part of a healthy diet. When separate groups were presented with “old” and “new” serving sizes, the group presented with the “new” serving sizes said they would serve both themselves and guests more food. Although the FDA states that the serving sizes listed on the nutrition labels are not recommended amounts to be consumed, is it possible that the new labels will ultimately lead to the ingestion of more calories?








For the accompanying labels, the serving size is 2/3 cup, which equals 55 g and 230 (kilo) calories. Note that both the serving size and the total calories are in larger bold letters and given prominence in the newly approved new label. Individual nutrients are also given in grams. The unnamed food in this label contains 8 g of fat, 37 g of carbohydrate, but no added sugar, and 3 g of protein. Fat is not usually calculated in g·kg
−1
·d
−1
, but to obtain this value for carbohydrate and protein, all that is needed is to divide by body weight in kilograms. For example, for a 154 lb (70 kg) individual, this represents 0.53 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 of carbohydrate and 0.04 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 of protein. Obviously, this does not satisfy the daily recommendations, but it does illustrate how these values can be obtained. All that is needed would be to total the carbohydrate and protein intake for all the food ingested during the day and divide it by body weight. Thus, if this individual ate 310 g of carbohydrate during the day, it would result in 4.43 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
, very close to the recommended 4.5 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
. Note that the new label would include sugar that is not natural to the food, that is, “added sugar” to encourage food choices with less added sugar.








The % daily value (%DV) column based on a 2,000-kcal diet and shows what percentage of the daily recommendation is achieved by eating the contents to which the label is attached. The fat content represents 10% DV and carbohydrate 13% DV. A %DV for protein is not required by the FDA unless a claim is made such as “high in protein” or the product is intended for children under the age of 4 years. This is because protein intake is not a public health concern. Note that there is also no %DV for
 trans
 fat because this type of fat should be kept as low as possible. Foods that are “low” in a nutrient generally contain ≤5% DV; foods that are a “good” source of a nutrient generally contain 10–19% DV; foods that are a “high/rich/excellent” source of a nutrient generally contain ≥20% DV.








The information in a food label is based in large part on the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. The primary goals of the basic recommendations are to prevent nutrient deficiencies and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. The two DRI reference values used in this text are






1.
 Recommended daily allowance (RDA)
—the average daily intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of 97–98% of healthy individuals by age and sex.




2.
 Adequate intake (AI)
—used when an RDA cannot be determined. The AI is based on observation or is experimentally determined and is an estimate of intake by healthy individuals.






Most vitamin and mineral percentages presented in food labels are based on DRI/RDA values. In the old label presented, one serving supplies 10% of the RDA of vitamin A, 8% of vitamin C, 20% of calcium, and 45% of iron. The new labels replaces vitamins A and C with D and potassium.








It is also proposed that the nutrition labels be moved to the front of the food container. Food companies will, of course, be given a couple years to comply with the new labeling regulations.

Carbohydrate
s


The discussion of carbohydrate metabolism in Chapter 2
 pointed out several important facts about carbohydrates as a fuel for exercise (ACSM et al., 2009
; ADA, 1987
; Burke and Read, 1989
; Costill, 1988
; Nieman, 1990
):



1.
 The higher the intensity of exercise (whether continuous or intermittent; aerobic, anaerobic, or aerobic-anaerobic), the more important glycogen is as a fuel.




2.
 The body can only store limited amounts of carbohydrates. Training increases the ability to store carbohydrate and to spare carbohydrate. However, 60–90 minutes of heavy endurance work seriously depletes glycogen stores, and depletion can be complete in 120 minutes. Muscle glycogen can also be depleted by 15–30 minutes of near-maximal intensity or supramaximal-intensity interval work.




3.
 Fat metabolism is linked to carbohydrate metabolism. Fatigue, “hitting the wall,” and exhaustion are related to glycogen depletion during high-intensity, long-duration activity. Thus, having an adequate supply of muscle glycogen is necessary to avoid fatigue. Whatever glycogen is utilized, in training or competition, must be replenished before more heavy work can be done.




How much carbohydrate should be included in the diet? The RDA of carbohydrate (

Table 6.1

) for the average sedentary individual is 4.5 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
. For an individual in training, a graduated increase in CHO ingestion is recommended (

Burke et al., 2011

) as follows:







For low-intensity, short duration exercise: 4.5–5 g·kg−1
·d−1







For moderate exercise, 1 hr·d−1
: 5–7 g·kg−1
·d−1







For endurance training, moderate to high intensity 1–3 hr·d−1
: 6–10 g·kg−1
·d−1







For extreme training, moderate to high intensity greater than 4–5 hr·d−1
: 8–12 g·kg−1
·d−1







Which carbohydrates should be eaten? All carbohydrates are not the same, and the traditional classification of CHO into “simple” or “complex” carbohydrates according to chemical structure is not useful in terms of the “healthfulness” and impact on glucose and insulin levels. To solve this dilemma, the concept of the glycemic index is used.


Glycemic Index


The glycemic index (GI)
 categorizes foods based on the glucose response they produce, using a numerical value for comparing foods. The GI compares the elevation in blood glucose caused by the ingestion of 50 g of any carbohydrate food with the elevation caused by 50 g of white bread or glucose (dextrose) 2 hour postingestion (Foster-Powell et al., 2002
; Wolever, 1990
; Wong and Chung, 2003
). Thus, the GI value of any given food depends on the speed at which it is digested and absorbed compared with a reference food. When white bread is used as the reference carbohydrate, it has a GI of 100.






High-glycemic foods have a rating of 85 or greater.






Moderate-glycemic foods rate from 60 to 85.






Low-glycemic foods have a rating less than 60.






Values above 100 are possible; for example, glucose has a value of 143 compared to white bread. When glucose is used as the reference food, the values of all other foods are lower than when white bread is the reference. When referring to tables of GI, it is important to note whether white bread or glucose is the reference value. All the values in Table 6.3
 use white bread as the reference food.

 Glycemic Index of Selected Foods

; Jenkins et al. (1981)
; Singh et al. (1994)
; Wolever (1990)
; and Walton and Rhodes (1997)
.





Foods with a high GI (HGI) cause a fast elevation in glucose and subsequently in insulin; foods with lower indices cause a slower rise in both glucose and insulin.
 
Table 6.3

 gives examples of high-, moderate-, and low-glycemic foods. In general, sugars and sports drinks, syrups and jellies, and grain, pasta, and cereal products have high or moderate glycemic indices (MGI). Most fruits, legumes, and dairy products have low glycemic indices (LGI). Meat, poultry, fish, avocados, salad vegetables, cheese, and eggs do not have GI values because these foods contain little or no carbohydrate and when eaten alone do not usually cause a meaningful increase in blood glucose. A food’s GI value also depends on where it is grown, its variety (with foods such as rice), and how it is processed (

Foster-Powell et al., 2002

).




In addition to the GI of specific foods, how an individual’s body responds to CHO ingestion depends also, in part, on the person’s fitness level (

Manore, 2002

).
 
Figure 6.3

 shows the typical response pattern of a sedentary individual, a moderately active individual, and a trained endurance runner. In general, trained individuals have a lower glycemic (and hence lower insulin) response to food than do untrained individuals.

The GI compares food containing the same amount of CHO. It does not take into account the serving size. To do this, the glycemic load (GL) must be calculated. The GL is the product of the amount of available carbohydrate (g) and the GI divided by 100 (

Manore et al., 2004

;
 
Wong and Chung, 2003

). Thus, eating a large portion of any food produces a higher GL than does a small portion. The higher the GL is, the greater the elevation in blood glucose and insulin. The premise of GL is that the effect, if any, on exercise performance is determined by the overall glycemic effect of a diet

 and not by the amount of CHO alone (

O’Reilly et al., 2010

). The

 following section will concentrate on glycogen replenishment, called resynthesis, because of the importance of adequate glycogen levels to training.

Glycogen Resynthesis


The storage of carbohydrate in liver and muscles depends primarily on the severity of glycogen depletion resulting from activity, the extent of muscle trauma, and the amount of dietary carbohydrate. Muscle glycogen resynthesis is fastest when the muscle has been depleted, but not necessarily exhausted, and the diet is high in carbohydrate. Muscle fiber damage associated with exhaustive eccentric exercise (in which a contracting muscle is forcibly lengthened), such as running marathon distances especially if downhill running is involved, may delay resynthesis for as long as 7–10 days despite elevated dietary carbohydrate (Burke and Read, 1989
; Costill, 1988
).



Given optimal amounts of dietary carbohydrate, muscle glycogen resynthesis is faster (per muscle mass per hour) after short-term, high-intensity exercise than after long-term, submaximal endurance exercise. Rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis following dynamic resistance exercise are slower than after short-term, high-intensity exercise but may be less than, equal to, or slightly faster than resynthesis following prolonged endurance exercise. The rate at which glycogen resynthesis occurs largely depends on the blood lactate concentration (higher levels result in faster rates of synthesis) and eccentric loading (higher levels result in slower rates of resynthesis) (

Pascoe and Gladden, 1996

).




Glycogen resynthesis occurs at about 5–6% per hour under optimal dietary conditions, thus requiring approximately 17–20 hours for complete recovery (

Coyle, 1991

;
 
Coyle and Coyle, 1993

). Optimal conditions involve both the timing and the type of CHO ingestion. Glycogen resynthesis postexercise occurs in two physiological phases: early (<4 hours), which appears to be insulin independent, and late (>4 hours), which shows a period of enhanced insulin sensitivity and is thus, insulin dependent. Consuming CHO immediately after exercise results in higher glycogen levels 4 hours after exercise than if CHO ingestion is delayed 2 hours. Thus, when the interval between exercise sessions is short (<8 hours), carbohydrate ingestion (50–100 g at the rate of 1.2 g·kg BW
−1
·hr
−1
) should







Begin as soon after the workout or competition as is practical (15–30 minutes)






Continue at that rate every 15–20 minutes until a larger meal of solid food (150–250 g of carbohydrate) is desired and possible






Be maintained for at least 4–6 hours (Betts and Williams, 2010
; Cermak and van Loon, 2013
; Coyle and Coyle, 1993
; Jentjens and Jeukendrup, 2003
)






However, when a longer recovery time is available:






The consumption of CHO immediately is not as important but is recommended (Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014
).






As long as 7–10 g·kg BW−1
 of CHO is consumed over 24 hours at a rate of at least 50 g·hr−1
, muscle and liver glycogen will be replaced over this time (Donaldson et al., 2010
).






There may be a ceiling effect of 500–600 g of CHO consumed in a day, above which no further resynthesis occurs (Millard-Stafford et al., 2008
).



Selection of the type of postexercise CHO should be based on the time available for replenishment and GI of the food (

Coyle, 1991

;
 
Coyle and Coyle, 1993

;
 
Donaldson et al., 2010

;
 
Manore et al., 2004

;
 
Singh et al., 1994

;
 
Wong and Chung, 2003

). In general, this means individuals should ingest







High-glycemic foods immediately after exercise






High-glycemic CHO and a mixed balanced meal when solid food is eaten






High-glycemic foods during recovery (Manore et al., 2004
) when time is relatively shor
t






Moderate-glycemic foods may also be useful, however, because they appear to promote glycogen resynthesis just about as effectively (Coyle and Coyle, 1993
; Hausswirth and Le Meur, 2011
). The chemical makeup of the CHO also matters.






Ingestion of glucose and sucrose results in a faster replenishment than does ingestion of fructose, primarily because glucose and sucrose promote muscle glycogen resynthesis, whereas fructose promotes liver glycogen resynthesis.






A combination of glucose and fructose can be an effective combination for the resynthesis of both muscle and liver glycogen.






The optimal combination for liver glycogen resynthesis, however, may be maltodextrin drinks with added fructose or galactose. These have been shown to be twice as effective as maltodextrin plus glucose drinks in restoring liver glycogen during short-term postexercise recovery (DéCombaz et al., 2011
).






Fructose alone is not recommended because it must first be converted to glucose in the liver before muscles can store it as glycogen (Betts and Williams, 2010
; Blom et al., 1987
; Cermak and van Loon, 2013
; Costill, 1988
; Coyle, 1991
; Poole et al., 2010
). This conversion delays the process of replenishing muscle glycogen stores.






The addition of amino acids and/or protein to a carbohydrate supplement can potentially increase muscle glycogen synthesis because of an enhanced insulin response. Insulin stimulates both glucose uptake and activation of glycogen synthase—the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen synthesis. When carbohydrate is ingested at the rate of ≥1.2 g·kg−1
·hr−1
 at regular intervals, however, higher insulin concentrations do not further increase the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis. Conversely, when carbohydrate intake is insufficient (<1.2 g·kg−1
·hr−1
), the addition of amino acids and/or protein can be beneficial. It may not always be possible for an athlete to consume this much CHO, or the athlete may simply prefer a moderate CHO intake (0.8 g·kg−1
·hr−1
) in combination with amino acids or protein at the rate of ≥0.3 g·kg−1
·hr−1
. This should result in the same amount of glycogen resynthesis as the high CHO alone. The combination may have an additional advantage of stimulating postexercise protein anabolism, thus stimulating tissue growth and repair. Thus, the combination of CHO and protein may be particularly beneficial after heavy resistance training (Betts and Williams, 2010
; Cermak and van Loon, 2013
; Donaldson et al., 2010
; Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014
; Jentjens and Jeukendrup, 2003
; Manninen, 2006
; McLellan et al., 2014
; O’Reilly et al., 2010
; Poole et al., 2010
).



Interestingly, chocolate milk has been shown to be beneficial as a recovery beverage (

Table 6.4

). Cow’s milk provides all the essential amino acids, and the CHO content of fat-free chocolate milk exceeds that of white milk. One study compared endurance capacity after a glycogen depletion trial and a 4-hour recovery period during which the participants ingested either chocolate milk (CM), a fluid replacement drink (Gatorade), or a CHO replacement drink (Endurox R4). All three beverages had similar amounts of CHO. The CM and CHO replacement drink had similar amounts of PRO and total kcal. Participants cycled 51% longer after ingesting CM than the CHO replacement alone and 43% longer after ingesting CM than fluid replacement alone (

Thomas et al., 2009

). Another study compared the effects of fat-free chocolate milk with an equal caloric CHO drink. The milk contained 16 g of protein, and the CHO drink had none. The milk was as effective as the CHO drink at maintaining muscle glycogen during recovery and for performance in a subsequent exercise bout. In addition, milk ingested during recovery significantly increased skeletal muscle protein synthesis, decreased whole-body protein breakdown, and suppressed or maintained molecular activity of protein breakdown during the recovery period. These results suggest that chocolate milk supports both skeletal muscle and whole-body protein recovery as well as glycogen resynthesis (

Lunn et al., 2012

).

Fox et al. (2004)

 studied the impact of fat calories added to meals after exercise on glycogen resynthesis and glucose tolerance and found that as long as the meals ingested in the hours after exercise contain the same amount of carbohydrate, the addition of fat neither helped nor hindered muscle glycogen resynthesis.




If carbohydrates are not replenished between training bouts, local muscle fatigue will occur, and work output during succeeding training sessions will decline (

Costill, 1988

;
 
Coyle, 1991

). Severe depletion followed by a nonoptimal diet will require more than 1 day of rest, which is one reason to alternate body parts and hard to easy exercise days. CHO intake can also have a significant positive effect by counteracting the suppressed immune function and inflammatory processes that occur during and after intense, prolonged exercise (

Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014

). Despite these documented results and recommendations, there is currently a great deal of interest in nutritional periodization that includes “
train low-compete high
”
 CHO manipulation
 (

Bartlett et al., 2015

).




In the “train low-compete high” variation, selected training sessions are deliberately begun with reduced CHO availability, but competition is begun with high CHO availability. A growing body of scientific evidence has demonstrated that reduced CHO availability can promote training-induced adaptations in human skeletal muscle. These adaptations include increased maximal mitochondrial enzyme activity and/or mitochondrial content, increased rates of lipid oxidation, and in some instances, improved exercise capacity. Assuming that the individual does not have a chronically low CHO diet, such sessions could still occur, for example, after an overnight fast, during two per day training when CHO is not ingested between sessions, or if CHO intake is withheld during the first few hours of recovery. The periodization aspect of this technique must be emphasized owing to the potential negative responses to a consistent lack of CHO. Performing repeated training sessions with reduced CHO may lead to decreased training intensity, immunosuppression, muscle protein breakdown, and an impairment in the ability to subsequently oxidize ingested CHO. To minimize these possible outcomes, it is suggested

 that individuals should consume caffeine prior to these workouts and/or practice CHO mouth rinse during exercise to help maintain exercise intensity. During mouth rinsing, a CHO solution is taken into the mouth, swished around, and spit out. Although the research has not been unanimous, enough studies have shown improved performance over placebo trials to recommend this procedure. It is thought that there may be receptors in the mouth that sense the availability of CHO and communicate this to the brain immediately thereby facilitating corticomotor output to skeletal muscle (

Cermak and van Loon, 2013

). Protein should be ingested before, during, and/or immediately after exercise to enhance muscle protein synthesis. The practice of training low should be alternated with sessions of training high where the intended competition-nutrition schedule (carbohydrate loading, pre-exercise meal that includes CHO, and CHO during exercise) is followed to maintain CHO oxidation ability. The “train low-compete high” training technique is currently a widely debated topic among coaches, athletes, and sport scientists, and both the optimal approach to follow and the extent of performance enhancement have yet to be elucidated (

Bartlett et al., 2015

).




Although most individuals would benefit from increasing their percentage of carbohydrate ingested, the levels listed above are recommended only for athletes or fitness participants who are actually using high amounts of carbohydrate in their training regimens. Ingesting 70% carbohydrates has little advantage and possibly some risk, for nonendurance athletes such as golfers, softball or baseball players, fitness walkers, or sedentary individuals, especially if much of this food has a high glycemic index and the diet has a high glycemic load (high GL). As mentioned earlier, a high GL can result in temporary hyperglycemia and an increased insulin response. Because glycogen storage is limited in sedentary and non–endurance-trained individuals, the glycolytic pathway is overloaded. The result is a greater-than-normal reliance on a side pathway that converts the glucose to free fatty acids (and then triglycerides) and cholesterol (

Costill, 1988

;
 
Newsholme and Leech, 1983

). Absorption of the same amount of low-glycemic carbohydrates results in a smaller blood glucose and insulin rise and thus less lipid formation. High blood levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol are frequently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The long-term consumption of a diet with a relatively high

 GL (adjusted for total energy) is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast and colon cancer, and obesity (

Foster-Powell et al., 2002

).




Endurance-trained individuals demonstrate less hyperglycemia and a lower insulin response to a given glucose load than do untrained individuals. Endurance-trained individuals thus appear to convert high dietary levels of carbohydrate, especially high-glycemic foods, into glycogen storage without an elevation of blood lipids. Carbohydrate should be the highest percentage energy substrate for everyone, but an additional 10–20% above the RDA is not recommended for sedentary individuals or low-intensity nonendurance athletes (

Costill, 1988

).




Three categories of carbohydrate sources have been developed that are specifically marketed for active individuals and athletes: sports drinks, sports bars, and sports gels.



Sports Drinks


Liquid carbohydrate sources are as effective as solid carbohydrate sources for glycogen replenishment. In fact, liquids may be even more useful, because many individuals are not hungry after an intense bout of exercise but are willing to drink liquid, and fluid replacement is also important (Betts and Williams, 2010
; Costill, 1988
; Coyle, 1991
; Jentjens and Jeukendrup, 2003
). Along with chocolate milk, Table 6.4
 compares several currently available commercial sports drinks containing carbohydrates. Several drinks also include protein. Note that the drinks have been categorized as fluid/electrolyte replacement drinks, fluid/fuel replacement drinks, and recovery/replenishment drinks. Water is included for comparison. Many more with different formula are available. Note also that sports drinks are not the same as “energy drinks” or “energy shots,” which are marketed for their mental stimulatory effects and sudden “bursts” of energy. Energy drinks typically contain caffeine, carbohydrate, and herbal ingredients such as (but not limited to) ginseng extract, green tea extract, yerba mate, S-HTP, and St. John’s wort extract. These ingredients in proprietary blends may or may not be safe or useful for active individuals (Campbell et al., 2013
; Duchan et al., 2010
; Gurley et al., 2015
). Although some sports drinks contain low amounts of the stimulant caffeine, they are designed to maximize fluid absorption and support performance or recovery by delivering water, electrolytes, carbohydrate, and in some cases protein. Sports drinks with appropriate amounts of carbohydrate and electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) aid in the maintenance of homeostasis, prevent injuries, delay fatigue, and optimize performance (Coombes and Hamilton, 2000
; von Duvillard et al., 2008
). Those manufactured by reputable companies have generally been tested and found to be both safe and effective (Seebohar, 2007
). Carbohydrate may be in the form of glucose or glucose polymer (maltodextrin), fructose, or sucrose (glucose + fructose), either alone or in combination. The longer the endurance event, the more important the inclusion of a variety of CHO forms is. Physiologically, this is related to the way in which glucose is transported from the small intestines. Glucose is transported across the membrane of the intestinal epithelium using the sodium-dependent glucose transporter SGLT1. This transporter becomes saturated when glucose intake is around 60 g·hr−1
. Fructose is transported by GLUT5 and is independent of the saturation of SGLT1. Thus, when glucose and fructose are ingested in combination total delivery of CHO can be increased from 1.0 to 1.2 g·min−1
 to as high as 1.75 g·min−1
. This occurs only when glucose/glucose polymers are already being consumed at the near maximal rates of approximately 1.2 g·min−1
. All monosaccharides are transported into the circulation by GLUT2 (Baker and Jeukendrup, 2014
; Cermak and van Loon, 2013
; Jeukendrup, 2013
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
). The concentration (%) of carbohydrate in these selected sports drinks varies from less than 1–17% in the different categories of drink. In general:






A CHO concentration of less than 4% is the most useful for workouts lasting less than an hour and in situations where hydration, not substrate availability, is the primary concern. A mouth rinse may be sufficient. Single or multiple transportable carbohydrates may be used.






Carbohydrate concentrations of 6–8% are optimum for use during workouts longer than 60 minutes when both fluid and fuel need to be supplied. The optimal amount of CHO is approximately 30 g·hr−1
 for 1–2 hours of activity, 60 g·hr−1
 for 2–3 hours of exercise, and 90 g·hr−1
 for events longer than 2.5 hours for well-trained endurance or intermittent sport athletes working at moderate to high intensity. Single or multiple transportable carbohydrates may be used for sessions under 2.5 hours. Over 2.5 hours, only multiple transportable carbohydrates are recommended ( Jeukendrup, 2014
). Individuals exercising at lower intensity do not need such high CHO ingestion (Cermak and van Loon, 2013
). CHO concentrations greater than 8% are best for recovery situations when glycogen replenishment is the primary goal. The inclusion of sodium, carbohydrate, and protein in postexercise fluid ingestion also stimulates rehydration and retention of ingested fluids (Baker and Jeukendrup, 2014
).






The processing of exogenous CHO is independent of body or muscle mass so fluid amounts do not need to be recommended on a per kg mass basis. A key to selecting a sports drink is to find one that tastes good to the individual and is well tolerated. These guidelines will be the same for competition as for training, but it is vitally important that they be practiced in training sessions before being used in competition.


Sports Bars



Table 6.5
 provides the macronutrient breakdown for selected sports bars and a Snickers candy bar for comparison purposes. Sports bars (Figure 6.4
) provide readily available carbohydrate and fall into two generic categories: (1) high carbohydrate (>60% of total calories) with minimal fat and protein and (2) minimal to moderate carbohydrate (20–55% of total calories) with balanced fat and protein (~22–40% of each) (Applegate, 1998
; Manore, 2000
).
 High-carbohydrate bars are suitable for ingestion before, during, and after exercise. CHO in the form of glucose plus fructose in a sports bar plus water is effectively utilized during exercise (Pfeiffer et al., 2010b
). Fat consumed during exercise is not readily available for energy; moreover, fat slows digestion and can lead to stomach upset. Bars with 4 g or less of fat (per 230 kcal serving size) are fine for workouts, but bars with higher fat content are best used as dietary supplements or snacks after exercise.





TABLE 6.5
 Composition of Selected Sports Bars*







*Values may vary slightly by flavor; based on nutrients, some caloric values appear to be underestimates.

FIGURE 6.4
 Ingestion of Carbohydrate or Carbohydrate and Protein before, during, and after Exercise Training Sessions Can Be Accomplished by Ingesting Specially Formulated Sports Drinks and/or Eating Sports Bars with Water.





Before or during exercise, it is best to select sports bars with no more than 8–10 g of protein because higher protein amounts also slow digestion. Likewise, bars with more than 5 g of fiber should not be ingested before or during exercise because fiber slows digestion. However, high-fiber bars can be good choices for snacks because fiber delays hunger pangs. If a sports bar is to be used as a meal replacement, one with high protein should be selected. Similarly, high-protein bars can be used in recovery.




The amount of vitamins and minerals included in many sports bars ranges from 5 to 100% of suggested daily values. Whenever a bar is eaten, it is important to drink at least 350–475 mL (12–16 oz.) of water to aid digestion. Sports bars can serve as a convenient, effective fuel source, but they are engineered food and should not completely replace a healthy natural food diet.



Sports Gels


Another type of packaged food for active individuals is the sports gel. Sports gels are products with a consistency of syrup or pudding and come in small plastic or foil packets. They contain roughly 20–25 g (~100 kcal) of easy-to-digest carbohydrates per serving. Some gels contain electrolytes (especially potassium) and/or caffeine, but none contains fat (Table 6.6
). Gels are best consumed every 30–45 minutes during longer training sessions and races lasting longer than 60 minutes. An interesting variation on the gel is the sports jelly bean. These are similar in nutrient content to the other semiliquid gels but may be less messy to consume. Any number of “chews” are available as well. As with sports bars, it is important to ingest sufficient water (8 oz. per packet of gel) and to try out a variety of gels during training to determine individual reactions before ingesting any during competition. A glucose plus fructose mixture of CHO ingested as a gel (plus water) leads to similar oxidation rates and efficiencies as a liquid CHO mixture (Pfeiffer et al., 2010a
).

Protei
n


The optimal amount of dietary protein for individuals engaged in exercise training and competition has long been debated but remains controversial. The RDA of protein varies among countries for adults (United States and Canada: 0.8 g·kg−1
 for male and female; Australia: 1.0 g·kg−1
 for male and female; and the Netherlands: 1.0 g·kg−1
 for female and 1.2 g·kg−1
 for male) and within countries for various age groups. For example, the U.S. and Canadian RDA decreases from 0.95 g·kg−1
 for 4- to 13-year-olds to 0.85 g·kg−1
 for 14- to 18-year-olds. Pregnant or lactating females are encouraged to ingest higher levels of protein, but only the Netherlands officially recommends an increased intake (1.5 g·kg−1
·d−1
) for physically active individuals (Lemon, 1989a
, 1991
).



The reluctance of nutritional experts to recommend increased protein intake relative to body weight for physically active individuals is because it is assumed that the increase in calories to match those expended will also include an increase in protein to sufficiently cover any additional exercise-induced needs. However, in several situations, this assumption is questionable (

Campbell et al., 2007

;
 
Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
Phillips and Van Loon, 2011

), as discussed in the following sections. In all situations, in order to maximize adaptations from training sessions, the exerciser needs to rehydrate, replenish (muscle glycogen), and repair (damaged protein) in the postexercise period.



Resistance Training


The first situation in which a higher protein intake might be beneficial is training with the primary goal of a large increase in muscle mass (Kreider et al., 1993
; Lemon, 1989a
,b
; Lemon and Nagle, 1981
; Phillips and Van Loon, 2011
). Individuals involved in resistance training—such as weight lifters, powerlifters, body builders, football players, sprinters, and wrestlers—strive for increased muscular strength and/or hypertrophy. Training of this type typically increases protein in the muscle fibers (see Chapter 19
).






FOCUS ON RESEARCH






The Impact of Smoking on Postexercise Glycogen Synthesis






Cigarette smoking is known to alter
 muscle glycogen utilization and insulin-dependent glucose metabolism. This study was designed to determine the impact of smoking on postexercise glycogen synthesis. Eight healthy male smokers (≥20 cigarettes·d−1
; age = 24 ± 2 years; HT = 68.1 ± 1 in. [173 ± 3 cm]; WT = 154 lb [70 ± 4 kg]) and ten matched nonsmokers (age = 23 ± 1 year; HT = 68.9 ±1 in. [175 ± 3 cm]; WT = 147.4 ± 6.6 lb [67 ± 3 kg]) performed single-leg toe raises to deplete resting baseline glycogen levels by approximately 75%. The glycogen values in the accompanying graph were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The toe-raise activity has been shown to isolate the gastrocnemius muscle, thereby minimizing any meaningful systemic hormonal response to the exercise. Despite equal work, nonsmokers depleted more glycogen than did smokers for a lower postexercise level. All participants fasted 8 hours before reporting to the laboratory and remained in a fasted condition until the end of the experiment. Smokers were asked to abstain from smoking from 1 hour before reporting to the laboratory until the experiment ended (two were allowed to smoke 2.5 hours into the experiment).







As stated earlier in the text, muscle glycogen resynthesis from glycogen-depleting exercise occurs in two phases. Immediately postexercise, glycogen synthesis is insulin
 independent
. After approximately 1 hour, glycogen synthesis becomes insulin
 dependent
. During the first hour postexercise, glycogen synthesis rates were similar in the smokers (13.8 ± 1.1 mmol·L
−1
·hr
−1
) and nonsmokers (15.3 ± 1.31 mmol·L
−1
·hr
−1
). However, between hours 1 and 4, glycogen synthesis was significantly (P < 0.0002) impaired in the smokers (0.8 ± 0.2 mmol·L
−1
·hr
−1
) compared with the nonsmokers (4.5 ± 0.5 mmol·L
−1
·hr
−1
).








The investigators concluded that cigarette smoking impairs the insulin-dependent phase of muscle recovery from glycogen-depletion exercise—probably due to a reduction in glucose uptake via GLUT4 transporters.








Note that all subjects were in a fasted condition throughout the experiment. The impact of smoking has not been established when individuals eat in the postexercise period.

After an acute bout of dynamic resistance training, both muscle protein synthesis and breakdown rates are increased. Synthesis increases by approximately 50–100%, while breakdown increases less than 50%, resulting in a positive turnover. However, net protein balance remains negative unless protein/amino acids are provided soon after the exercise ends. Thus, both the nutritional content and the timing of postexercise caloric intake are important (

Bird et al., 2006

;
 
Fielding and Parkington, 2002

;
 
Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014

). The availability of protein/amino acids immediately after exercise (within 1 hour) probably maximizes muscle protein synthesis (

Lemon, 2000

;
 
Phillips, 2013

;
 
van Loon, 2014

;
 
Wolfe, 2006

).





Figure 6.5A

 shows the results of a study comparing supplement ingestion either just before or just after finishing a workout (PRE/POST) with ingestion in the morning before breakfast and late evening before bed (MOR/EVE). The supplement consisted (per 100 g) of 40 g of whey isolate protein, 43 g of glucose, less than 0.5 g of fat, and 7 g of creatine monohydrate. Although all subjects were familiar with resistance training, they underwent an 8- to 12-week structured program before being divided into two groups and adding the supplement component. The 10-week resistance program progressed from 70 to 75% 1-RM to 80–85% 1-RM and then to 90–95% 1-RM. As can be seen in
 
Figure 6.5

, the PRE/POST group improved their body composition, strength, and fast-twitch muscle fiber (IIa and IIx) hypertrophy more than did the MOR/EVE group (

Cribb and Hayes, 2006

).

On the other hand, ingestion of 20–40 g of protein prior to sleep has been shown to increase plasma amino acid availability, stimulate postexercise protein synthesis, and improve whole-body protein balance during the night (

Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014

;
 
van Loon, 2013

).




Current recommendations for protein intake and resistance training include the following:







Ingest 20–25 g or 0.25 g·kg BW−1
 of easily digestible PRO immediately postexercise.






Ingest 0.25 g·kg BW−1
 PRO every 4–5 hours (20–25 g with each main meal).






Ingest 0.25 g·kg BW−1
 up to 20–40 g PRO prior to sleep.






The amino acid composition is another consideration. Although complete protein with all amino acids is important in the overall diet, the essential amino acids have been shown to be the primary regulators of muscle protein synthesis. The branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and particularly leucine appear to be the most important stimulators of skeletal muscle protein synthesis (Campbell et al., 2007
; Phillips and Van Loon, 2011
; Volek, 2004
; Wolfe, 2006
). There is no evidence to support a recommendation of necessity for supplements of protein. Food protein, especially high-quality dairy protein that contains the essential amino acids including leucine, may be more effective than other protein sources (Phillips, 2013
). Whey (20%) and casein (80%) are the primary proteins in milk. Whey is the fluid portion of milk; casein is the curd. Both whey and casein components are highly digestible, have a high amino acid content, and have the ability to increase muscle protein. Whey protein elicits a sharp, rapid increase of plasma amino acids, especially leucine that activates muscle protein synthesis. Due to its coagulation in the stomach, casein protein elicits a moderate, prolonged increase in plasma amino acids that is sustained for hours and hence enables sustained stimulation of protein synthesis (Campbell et al., 2007
; Wolfe, 2015
). The recommended increases in protein ingestion for resistance athletes vary somewhat, but generally fall between the values of 1.2–2.0 g·kg−1
·d−1
 of protein. This amount should be possible within the recommended 10–35% of total caloric intake (ACSM et al., 2009; Brotherhood, 1984
; Haymes, 1983
; Lemon, 1989a
,b
, 1991
; Tarnopolsky et al., 1988
). For body builders, during the energy-restriction phase of their training, 30% protein intake is recommended (Lambert et al., 2004
) to reduce the lean body mass (LBM) loss. There is minimal scientific evidence that amino acid supplementation in excess of the additional amount needed to maintain a positive nitrogen balance enhances muscle hypertrophy or strength attainment (Lemon, 1989a
, 1991
). Highly trained resistance athletes may require less protein than novice lifters and only slightly more than the RDA (Fielding and Parkington, 2002
; Lemon, 2000
)
.


Endurance Training


The second situation in which increased protein might be beneficial is endurance training. When an individual begins a training program, a situation called sports anemia
 (sometimes called sports pseudoanemia
) may develop. This is a transient decrease in red blood cells and hemoglobin level (grams per deciliter, g·dL−1
). During the initial 2–3 weeks of a training program, blood proteins, including erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC), may be used to increase the myoglobin concentration, mitochondrial mass, and enzymes that are part of the training adaptation. In runners, RBCs may be destroyed by a mechanical trauma, called foot strike hemolysis
 (Hinton, 2014
; Schumacher et al., 2002
). Other possible causes of intravascular hemolysis (especially in swimmers and cyclists) include muscle contraction, dehydration, free radical actions, and the inflammatory response (Robinson et al., 2006
). A higher intake of dietary protein may minimize the destruction of red blood cells, promote their regeneration, and provide the protein needed for the other training adaptations (Robinson et al., 2006
).





Sports Anemia
 A transient decrease in red blood cells and hemoglobin level (grams per deciliter of blood).





Alternatively, however, sports anemia may be explained in terms of plasma volume expansion rather than protein (RBC) degradation. If plasma volume increases but hemoglobin and red blood cells do not (or they do not increase proportionally), a dilution effect will occur, resulting in decreased hemoglobin and red blood cell concentrations. Research supports that blood volume changes do occur. However, the two phenomena, increased dilution and protein degradation, are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, research evidence suggests that experienced and not just novice endurance athletes may also suffer sports anemia (

ADA, 1987

;
 
Haymes, 1983

;
 
Hinton, 2014

;
 
Lemon, 1989b

;
 
Tarnopolsky et al., 1988

).




In addition, high-intensity, long-duration training and competition result in increased amino acid oxidation as fuel, ranging from 5 to 15% of the total calories used, especially if the individual is depleted of carbohydrates (

Brotherhood, 1984

;
 
Gleeson, 2005

). Cool-temperature training (5–20°C or 40–68°F) also utilizes more protein than does warm-weather (30°C or 86°F) training. Females utilize more protein during exercise in the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle (~days 14–21) than during the follicular phase (~days 1–7) (

Phillips, 1999

).




Finally, skeletal muscle protein turnover increases at rest in healthy adults undergoing an aerobic exercise training program. In contrast to resistance training, a more negative net muscle protein balance (synthesis breakdown) has been shown with endurance training. In addition, plasma amino acid concentration decreases suggesting that 0.80 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 is insufficient to optimize muscle protein despite adequate caloric energy intake (

Pikosky et al., 2006

). Protein availability is critical for maximizing muscle adaptations in response to aerobic endurance training, including increasing synthesis in relation to breakdown, so that the net muscle protein balance is positive, favoring synthesis (

Hawley et al., 2006

).




There is some evidence that the combined ingestion of CHO and PRO prior to and during prolonged ultra-endurance exercise (>3–5 hours) may be beneficial. Such ingestion may prevent excessive muscle protein breakdown and allow muscle protein synthesis to be elevated during exercise. This could facilitate muscle

 reconditioning and improve training efficiency. On the other hand, the combination could slow the delivery of CHO and fluid during the exercise session and cause gastrointestinal distress. Obviously, this is something the individual athlete needs to practice (

Ivy and Ferguson-Stegall, 2014

;
 
van Loon, 2014

). The impact of alcohol ingestion on the benefits of protein intake on postexercise muscle synthesis in college-aged individuals is presented in the Focus on Application box. Immediate postexercise ingestion recommendations are the same for endurance training individuals as for resistance training individuals: 20–25 g or 0.25 g·kg BW
−1
 easily digestible PRO (ACSM et al., 2016). Overall a small increase in the intake of dietary protein to 1.2–1.4 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 is recommended for high-intensity, long-duration aerobic endurance training (ACSM et al., 2009). Individuals training at less than 50%


 ​
 for 20–60 min·d
−1
 do not need to increase their protein intake above the RDA. This increased amount of protein per kilogram of body weight, for high-intensity, long-duration aerobic endurance training, can be achieved without increasing the percentage above the recommended 10–35% of the total calories ingested (

Lemon, 1989a

;
 
Paul, 1989

). See the accompanying example for how this might be done.

Postexercise Alcohol Ingestion and Muscle Protein Synthesis






As stated earlier in this chapter, for individuals 19+ years alcohol ingestion is one of the top five sources of caloric intake (Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010
). The cultural environment surrounding some sports often involves the intake of large amounts of alcohol after training and/or competition. A study was conducted to compare the effect of only protein (PRO), alcohol plus protein (ALC-PRO), and alcohol plus carbohydrate (ALC-CHO) ingestion on postexercise muscle (myofibrillar) protein synthesis.







Eight physically active males (


​
 age = 21.4 ± 4.8 years) completed three exercise trials in a randomized cross-over design. Each exercise trial consisted of resistance exercise (8 × 5 reps leg extension at 80% 1-RM); continuous cycling (30 minutes at 63% of individually determined peak power); and, high intensity interval cycling (10 × 30 seconds at 110% individually determined peak power). Each trial was separated by 14 days and preceded by a standardized meal. Immediately and 4 hours post-ex, subjects ingested either 500 mL (25 g) of whey protein (PRO & ALC-PRO conditions) or 25 g maltodextrin carbohydrate (ALC-CHO trial). Alcohol ingestion (ethanol, 1.5 g∙kg BW
−1
) began 1 hour post-ex and was consumed in six equal volumes of 60 mL (2 oz.) vodka plus 240 mL (8 oz.) orange juice once every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours. At 2 hours post-ex, all subjects received a CHO-rich meal (1.5 g∙kg BW
−1
 CHO). Blood samples indicated that blood alcohol peaked at 0.06 g∙100 mL
−1
 in both the ALC-CHO and ALC-PRO trials at 4 hours post-ex and remained elevated (0.05 g∙100 mL
−1
 ALC-CHO; 0.03 g 100 mL
−1
 ALC-PRO) at 8 hours post-ex. Muscle biopsies were obtained preexercise, 2 hours post-ex, and 8 hours post-ex.












The results are shown in the accompanying graphs. Panel A presents the (myofibrillar) muscle protein synthesis rates measured as FSR (functional synthesis rate). Muscle protein synthesis increased significantly above rest for all conditions. However, compared to PRO alone, there was a significant reduction in FSR for the ALC-PRO and even more so for the ALC-CHO trial. Panel B presents these differences in percentage. The percent increase in FSR for PRO alone was 109%, 57% for the ALC-PRO trials, but only 29% for the ALC-CHO trial.








These results provide clear evidence of impaired muscle recovery when a large amount of alcohol is consumed postexercise even in the presence of optimal nutritional conditions otherwise. This may impair not only recovery but also adaptation to training and/or subsequent performance.

Calculate the protein intake for a 56-kg (123-lb) female in triathlete before she began training (pre) with her current training intake.







Pre-training caloric intake:








In-training caloric intake: 2,250 kcal·d
−1








If she maintains 12% protein ingestion, the calculation becomes








If she increases her PRO content to 15% of her increased calories:








The key point is that the total caloric intake

 must be increased. If the total energy intake is insufficient, then the percentage allotted to protein may be inadequate. For example, if the athlete increased her caloric intake to only 1,875 kcal·d
−1
 at 12% protein intake, this increase would amount to only 1 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
. Also, if the athlete increased her carbohydrate intake to 70%, she would need to carefully select the remaining 30% of her foodstuffs to get an adequate protein intake.




The problem of ingesting too few calories and thus inadequate protein is especially evident when athletes are concerned with percentage of body fat or making weight in a sport with weight categories. The problem is compounded in children and adolescents. As previously mentioned, individuals at this age need more protein than do adults. Inadequate protein intake at this age might adversely affect not only exercise performance but also growth (

Lemon, 1991

;
 
Steen, 1994

). Of course, if the extra protein ingested is also excess calories, body weight and fat will increase, and that also is not usually desirable.



Older Individuals


For older adults, inadequate nutrition and inadequate protein intake can also be a problem. In addition, the current RDA of 0.8 g·kg−1
·d−1
 seems insufficient to meet the protein needs of most elderly. Older individuals require more dietary protein than do younger adults to support good health, promote recovery from illness, and maintain functionality. They need to make up for age-related changes in protein metabolism such as declining anabolic responses to ingested protein and resistance exercise (Nowson and O’Connell, 2015
; Phillips, 2014
; Wall et al., 2014
). This “anabolic resistance” can be overcome by ingesting foods that are rich in leucine especially in close temporal proximity to physical activity (Wall et al., 2014
). Randomized controlled studies clearly show a benefit of increased dietary protein on lean mass gain and leg strength when combined with resistance exercise in those greater than 65 years. If insufficient protein is ingested, the body adapts by breaking down lean muscle mass to maintain nitrogen balance, which ultimately results in a cascade from the loss of muscle mass to frailty, falls, and a lower quality of life (Nowson and O’Connell, 2015
). The European Union Geriatric Society, in cooperation with other scientific organizations, appointed an international study group to review dietary protein needs for individuals greater than 65 years. This group recommended






An average daily protein intake of at least 1.0–1.2 g·kg−1
·d−1
 with 25–30 g being ingested per meal for a daily total of 60 g






An intake of 1.2–1.3 g·kg−1
·d−1
 for individuals engaged in either or both endurance and resistance training






An intake of 1.2–1.5 g·kg−1
·d−1
 for individuals at risk of malnutrition because of acute and chronic diseases (except those with kidney and other specific diseases) (Bauer et al., 2013
; Deutz et al., 2014
)






Adequate total calories intake to be ingested along with the increased protein






Before dietary protein is increased, the individual should undergo a complete dietary nutritional analysis under the guidance of a trained nutritionist. It is important to note that the US RDA for adults of any age remains at 0.8 g·kg−1
·d−1
. However, no adverse events have been reported for the recommended reasonable increases in protein intake for those older than 65 years given above (Wolfe, 2012
).



Can too much protein in the diet be harmful to a fitness participant or competitive athlete? Although concern has been expressed that excessive protein intake (>3 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
) may have negative effects including increased blood lipid levels, kidney damage, and dehydration (

Gleeson, 2005

), there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the suggested ranges for active individuals will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals (

Campbell et al., 2007

). In individuals with preexisting liver or kidney abnormalities, a high-protein diet can lead to further deterioration of the function (

ADA, 1987

;
 
Campbell et al., 2007

;
 
Lemon, 1989b

).




The metabolism of protein requires more water than does the metabolism of carbohydrate or fat. Increased excretion of nitrogen in urine increases urinary volume and the risk for dehydration. Therefore, water intake should be increased to avoid dehydration if protein intake is increased.




There is also some concern regarding the impact of high-protein intake on calcium loss. Early studies reported evidence in sedentary individuals that increasing the dietary protein leads to increased calcium excretion, suggesting a loss in bone calcium (

Allen et al., 1979

; Campbell et al., 2007;
 
Eisenstein et al., 2002

;
 
Lemon and Nagle, 1981

). It is now known that the phosphate content of protein food

 and supplements fortified with calcium and phosphorous negates this effect. Data from isotope studies suggest that the main source of the increase in urinary calcium from a high-protein diet is intestinal (dietary) and not from bone resorption. So, as with the concern for kidney function, there appear to be no adverse outcomes to increased protein intake within the recommended levels (up to 2 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
) in healthy, exercising individuals (

Campbell et al., 2007

).



Fat


As discussed in Chapters 2
 and 4
, fat is a major fuel for exercise of low or moderate intensity, and in most individuals, it is readily available in more-than-adequate stored amounts. In addition, studies have documented (Chapter 5
) that with endurance training, more fat can be utilized as a fuel, thereby sparing carbohydrate stores, and can be used at higher absolute levels of work intensity.



This increased ability to utilize fat and spare carbohydrate helps postpone fatigue in endurance and ultraendurance events. There has been a great deal of interest in whether a diet high in fat could enhance the glycogen sparing that occurs with training.




To be useful during training, a high-fat diet (defined as 60–70% FAT) must allow continuation of the intended training levels and progression in training adaptation through periodic tests or time trials. There is evidence that a relatively high training intensity has been maintained on a high-fat diet for at least 7 weeks in previously untrained and moderately trained individuals and for at least a short time in elite athletes. However, at all levels of training, higher ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were reported at constant exercise loads (

Fleming et al., 2003

;
 
Helge, 2000

,
 
2002

).
 
Figure 6.6

 provides an example. At the start of the study (A), both groups had parallel, similar RPE responses to a submaximal (71%


 ​
) exercise to exhaustion. After training (B), under different dietary conditions, those on the high-fat diet had a significantly higher RPE at 40 and 60 minutes of the same exercise (

Helge, 2000

). Heart rate values have also been reported to be higher at a given external submaximal workload. In this case, if training is adjusted according to the monitored heart rate, the power output or pace will be lower and the intended training stimulus not achieved (

Havemann et al., 2006

).

Adaptation to a fat-rich diet does lead to an increased ability to store, mobilize, transport, and utilize fat. There is also evidence that the storage of muscle glycogen and liver glycogen is lower with high-fat diets. As a result, more fat is oxidized during submaximal exercise, presumably sparing carbohydrate compared with an equal-calorie high-carbohydrate diet, even if carbohydrate is ingested immediately before or during the exercise (

Burke and Hawley, 2002

;
 
Helge, 2000

,
 
2002

). However, there generally appears to be no particular performance advantage to these metabolic shifts. The exercise performance of those consuming a high-fat diet is at best equal to, or in some cases lower than, that of those consuming a more traditional high-CHO training diet (ACSM et al., 2009;
 
ACSM et al., 2016; Burke and Hawley, 2002

;
 
Fleming et al., 2003

;
 
Helge, 2000

,
 
2002

;
 
Jacobs et al., 2004

;
 
Vogt et al., 2003

).
 
Figure 6.7

 shows

 the results of 7 weeks of training on either a high-fat or a high-CHO diet on a time-to-exhaustion test. Performance improved significantly in both groups. However, the high-CHO diet group improved significantly more than did the high-fat diet group (

Helge, 2002

).










FIGURE 6.7

Obviously, these high-fat diets are far above the recommended daily intake for health. The primary concern is that high-fat diets lead to unhealthy lipid profiles. Surprisingly, based on the few available studies, well-trained individuals who maintain that training seem to have no adverse effects in their lipid/lipoprotein profiles when consuming a high-fat diet over periods of up to 3 months. However, when training is not maintained or when a high-fat diet is consumed for longer, there probably are detrimental effects in general health (

Helge, 2000

). Thus, given the lack of any beneficial training effects and the real possibility of eventual negative health effects, a high-fat diet is not recommended for fitness or athletic training.




On the other hand, no attempt should be made to totally remove fat from the diet (ACSM et al., 2009;
 
ACSM et al., 2016; Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
Sherman and Leenders, 1995

). Diets in which less than 20% of the energy is provided from fat increase the risk of inadequate intakes of vitamin E, α-linolenic acid, and linoleic acid and for adverse changes in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. What then should fat intake be for active individuals?







There is no established RDA in g·kg−1
·d−1
 for fat but 0.5–1.5 g·kg−1
·d−1
 has been recommended (Kreider et al., 2010
).






As indicated on Table 6.1
, 65–80 g·d−1
 is a reasonable level for a total caloric input of 2,000–2,500 kcal·d−1
 or proportionally more (~3 g·100 kcal−1
) for higher caloric intakes in athletes.






Although diets that include ≥20% fat are adequate for sedentary individuals, it may be that well-trained athletes doing endurance training should not drop below 30% fat in their diet.






It is important to optimize the type of fat ingested. Most fats should come from polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acid sources such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Two servings of fish per week are recommended—with the caution that women of childbearing age, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children should avoid fish and shellfish that are likely to contain high levels of mercury. No more than 10% of dietary fat should be saturated, regardless of the activity level (Burke and Read, 1989
; Leaf and Frisa, 1989
; USDA & DHHS, 2010, 2015
). Restrictions on cholesterol intake level have been lifted because available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between dietary cholesterol intake and serum cholesterol level (USDA & DHHS, 2015
). Trans fatty acid consumption should be as low as possible. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that partially hydrogenated oils (the primary source of artificial trans fats in processed foods) are no longer recognized as safe and gave food companies 3 years to remove these oils from their products. Some trans fats do occur naturally in dairy foods and meat but are not considered a health concern (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2015
).

Vitamins


Thirteen compounds are now considered to be vitamins. Vitamins
 are organic substances of plant or animal origin that are essential for normal growth, development, metabolic processes, and energy transformations. The B complex vitamins have two major roles directly related to exercise: (1) involvement in energy production (see Chapter 2
 Focus on Application: Metabolic pathways: The vitamin connection) and (2) tissue synthesis and repair. For example, vitamin B6
 is important in amino acid metabolism and the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. Thiamin (B1
) is important in carbohydrate metabolism. Riboflavin (B2
) and niacin are important as the hydrogen carriers FAD and NAD, respectively. B12
 is needed for the production of red blood cells and protein synthesis. Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption in the intestines and is essential for normal calcium metabolism. Roles for vitamin D have been established in the function of the cardiovascular, immune, and musculoskeletal system. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is necessary for the formation of connective tissues and the catecholamine hormones (important in the stress response) and for the maintenance and function of blood vessels. Vitamin E influences the flow of electrons within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Both C and E are important in protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage (see Chapter 5
 Focus on Application: Oxygen-free Radicals, Exercise, Exercise Training Adaptations, and Antioxidant Supplements) (ACSM et al., 2009; Belko, 1987
; vander Beek, 1985
, 1991
). See animation, Biological Function of Vitamins, at http://thePoint.lww.com/Plowman5e






Vitamins
 Organic substances of plant or animal origin that are essential for normal growth, development, metabolic processes, and energy transformations.



Minerals
 Elements, not of animal or plant origin, that are essential constituents of all cells and of many functions in the body.





Vitamin D is obtained from only a few foods naturally or from fortified foods such as milk, juices, and cereals. It is synthesized in the skin through sunlight exposure. Athletes living far from the equator or those without sun exposure may need supplemental vitamin D during the winter (

Moran et al., 2013

). It appears that low vitamin D status in adolescent athletes can impair performance and increase the risk of injury. In this situation, monitoring of vitamin D status should be undertaken and correction of any deficiency be undertaken through increased sun exposure or supplementation (

Desbrow et al., 2014

). Some evidence suggests that exercise training may increase the need for vitamin C (especially in hot climates), B complex vitamins (particularly B
6
 and B
2
, also especially in hot climates), and vitamin E at high altitudes and as antioxidant defense against free radicals (

Belko, 1987

;
 
Blom et al., 1987

;
 
Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
vander Beek, 1985

,
 
1991

). These increased needs, as with other nutrients, should be adequately covered if the exerciser increases his or her total caloric intake with a balanced diet. The increased needs also mean that athletes who are concerned with restricting body weight or body fat or making weight (gymnasts, dancers, figure skaters, divers, wrestlers, boxers, and jockeys) and who restrict caloric intake could be at risk for an inadequate intake of vitamins. For these individuals, a generic, one-a-day vitamin and mineral tablet might be appropriate to ensure adequate intake (ACSM et al., 2009;
 
Belko, 1987

;
 
Kreider et al., 2010

). Athletes who participate in prolonged, strenuous exercise training should consume 100–1,000 mg of vitamin C daily (ACSM et al., 2009).




After decades of research, there is no evidence that vitamin supplementation improves an adequately nourished, healthy individual’s exercise or athletic performance, speeds up recovery, or decreases injuries (ACSM et al., 2009;
 
Belko, 1987

;
 
Haymes, 1983

;
 
Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
Lukaski, 2004

). If a deficiency is present, supplementation to the normal physiological level can improve performance. This is another reason for a complete nutritional analysis for anyone training or competing. However, megadoses of vitamins are neither substitutes for vigorous training nor necessary for training adaptations (

vander Beek, 1985

,
 
1991

). Furthermore, extremely large doses of either water- or fat-soluble vitamins can be toxic, can impair performance, and, more importantly, can cause health problems. Once again, if some is good, more is not necessarily better. For example, very high doses of vitamin C (>1 g·d
−1
) have been linked with the formation of kidney stones, the breakdown of red blood cells (which causes loss of hemoglobin), and an impairment of sport performance (

Braahkuis, 2012

). Megadoses of niacin inhibit fatty acid mobilization and utilization during exercise, thereby increasing the rate of glycogen use (

Nieman, 1990

). Doses of antioxidants such as vitamin E that are too high could be pro-oxidative instead of antioxidative (ACSM et al., 2009; ACSM et al., 2016).



Minerals



Minerals
 are elements, not of animal or plant origin, that are essential constituents of all cells and for many body functions. Minerals are classified as microminerals (trace elements) or macrominerals based on the amount in the body. Minerals are important for bone density, energy metabolism, enzyme function, muscle contraction, oxygen transport, insulin regulation, and ATP composition, to name just a few functions.


Microminerals


Of the 15 microminerals with DRI/RDAs (Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010
), only 5 (zinc, chromium, copper, selenium, and iron) have been shown to be affected by or potentially beneficial for exercise training or performance.



Zinc plays a role in repair of muscle tissue and energy production among other things. Low dietary zinc has been shown to impair metabolic responses during exercise

 (

Lukaski, 2005

). Because exercise can cause a sizable loss of zinc in sweat and urine, training may lead to a zinc deficiency. However, excess zinc intake above the RDA (11 mg·d
−1
 for adult males and 8 mg·d
−1
 for adult females) can result in an impaired immune response and decreased iron and copper absorption. Two studies with wrestlers have shown that zinc supplementation (3 mg·kg
−1
·d
−1
) had a positive effect on hematological variables and moderated the inhibition of thyroid hormones and testosterone after exhaustive exercise (

Kilic et al., 2004

,
 
2006

). Studies also indicate that zinc supplementation during training minimizes exercise-induced changes in immune function (

Kreider et al., 2010

). Evidence is insufficient, however, to conclude that zinc status or zinc supplementation affects exercise performance (ACSM et al., 2009;
 
Campbell and Anderson, 1987

;
 
Clarkson, 1991b

;
 
Lemon, 1989b

,
 
1991

;
 
McDonald and Keen, 1988

).




Chromium has a role in maintaining proper carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. There is speculation but little evidence that exercise and training may increase the requirements for chromium in part because exercise increases urinary chromium loss. Chromium has no RDA because data are insufficient for establishing these. Instead, daily AI values are 35 μg·d
−1
 for adult males and 25 μg·d
−1
 for adult females. Speculation that chromium can increase muscle mass and decrease the percentage of body fat in conjunction with resistance training remains just that—speculation (

Lefavi et al., 1992

). Chromium supplementation (as chromium picolinate) has not been shown to have any positive effect on body composition in healthy individuals when taken alone or used in conjunction with an exercise program (

Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
Volpe, 2008

). Conversely, recent studies suggest potentially deleterious effects (

Lukaski et al., 2007

;
 
Vincent, 2003

).




There is no evidence that either selenium or copper has an impact on acute or chronic exercise responses, although copper may be lost in sweat. The RDA for copper is 890 μg·d
−1
 for adolescents and 900 μg·d
−1
 for adults. Selenium functions as an antioxidant, so the need for selenium is increased during exercise training without being linearly related to energy expenditure (

Margaritis et al., 2005

). Suboptimal selenium status has been implicated in a worsening of muscle function following eccentric muscle contractions (

Milias et al., 2006

), but it does not appear that selenium supplementation would be beneficial for exercise performance (

Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
Volpe, 2008

). The RDA for selenium is 55 μg·d
−1
 for male and female adolescents and adults. Intakes of selenium above 1,000 μg·d
−1
 can be toxic (

Campbell and Anderson, 1987

;
 
Clarkson, 1991b

).




Iron is required for the formation of hemoglobin and myoglobin as well as enzymes involved in energy production. Iron deficiency can be a problem for exercising or training individuals, especially for menstruating females. Iron deficiency occurs in three stages: (1) iron depletion or low-storage levels of iron; (2) iron deficiency erythropoiesis, which is an impairment of the ability to produce red blood cells; and (3) iron deficiency anemia or low hemoglobin levels (<12 g·dL
−1
 for females and <13 g·dL
−1
 for males). Iron deficiency anemia is also characterized by small, pale red blood cells; decreased iron levels in the blood; decreased iron stores; and increased total iron binding capacity as the body attempts to mobilize as much iron as possible. Iron depletion is not associated with reduced performance, and iron deficiency erythropoiesis has marginal impact. However, iron deficiency anemia definitely impairs performance. Lower hemoglobin levels mean lower oxygen transport. Moderate levels of exercise do not appear to affect iron status.




Iron supplementation given to individuals with iron deficiency anemia consistently improves iron status and exercise performance (

Kreider et al., 2010

). Iron supplementation given to individuals with iron depletion or iron deficiency erythropoiesis shows variable but primarily nonsignificant changes in performance. Iron requirements for endurance athletes are increased by approximately 70% (ACSM et al., 2009); however, excessive iron intake can inhibit zinc and copper absorption and cause free radical production. The iron status of an individual should be ascertained before supplementation is given that exceeds the RDA (11 mg·d
−1
 for adolescent males, 8 mg·d
−1
 for adult males, 15 mg·d
−1
 for adolescent females, and 18 mg·d
−1
 for adult females). Supplemental iron should be taken with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to enhance absorption. Iron status should be monitored every 4–6 weeks during supplementation (ACSM et al., 2009; ACSM et al., 2016;
 
ADA, 1987

;
 
Clarkson, 1990

;
 
Haymes, 1983

;
 
Hinton, 2014

;
 
McDonald and Keen, 1988

;
 
Zoller and Vogel, 2004

).



Macrominerals


Macrominerals include calcium, chlorine, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulfur. As macromineral electrolytes, chlorine, potassium, and sodium are discussed in the section “Fluid Ingestion During and After Exercise” in Chapter 14
. Sulfur has no direct importance for exercise.



The function of calcium in bone health is directly related to exercise training and is fully described in
 
Chapter 016

. Beyond its role in bone health, the relationship between exercise, training, and calcium level and supplementation is largely unknown (

Clarkson, 1991a

).




Magnesium is involved in oxygen uptake and energy production. Because magnesium is lost in sweat and urine, strenuous exercise may increase the need for magnesium by 10–20%. Some evidence suggests that a marginal magnesium deficit impairs exercise performance and increases oxidative stress (ACSM et al., 2009). Increased magnesium intake has beneficial effects on exercise performance in magnesium-deficient individuals. However, supplemental magnesium has not been shown to increase performance in active individuals with adequate magnesium status (

Kreider et al., 2010

;
 
Nielsen and Lukaski, 2006

;
 
Volpe, 2008

). Levels above the RDA (400–420 mg·d
−1
 for adolescent and adult males and 360–310 mg·d
−1
 for adolescent and adult females) do not appear to be harmful (

McDonald and Keen, 1988

)

.




Several studies have shown that phosphate loading (in the form of sodium phosphate)—increasing phosphate ingestion for several days before an event—may improve performance by delaying the onset of anaerobic metabolism; other studies using a variety of phosphate formula have shown no beneficial effects (

Kreider et al., 2010

). Because phosphorus supplementation over an extended period of time can result in lowered blood calcium levels, it is not recommended. The RDA for phosphorus is 1,200 mg·d
−1
 for adolescents and 700 mg·d
−1
 for adult males and females (

Clarkson, 1991a

).




In summary, the pattern here is the same for minerals as the one for vitamins. That is, neither microminerals nor macrominerals can be considered ergogenic aids. Exercisers should ingest the RDA/AI amounts and, unless diagnosed with a deficiency, only those amounts. For those who are strictly limiting their caloric intake, a generic vitamin-and-mineral one-a-day pill can be recommended.





Nutrition for Competition




The five goals for an optimal competitive diet are to:



1.
 Ensure adequate fuel supplies in the pre-event time span




2.
 Ensure adequate fuel supplies during the event, regardless of its duration




3.
 Facilitate temperature regulation by preventing dehydration




4.
 Achieve the desired weight classification while maintaining fuel and water supplies




5.
 Avoid gastrointestinal discomfort during competition




Depending on the event, an athlete’s diet may need to be adjusted during a period of hours or days before competition. Often, manipulation focuses on carbohydrate consumption (

ACSM et al., 2016; Burke and Read, 1989

).



Carbohydrate Loading (Glycogen Supercompensation)


Individuals competing in continuous endurance events lasting at least 90 minutes at 65–85%

​
 may use carbohydrate loading, sometimes called glycogen supercompensation (ACSM et al., 2016; ADA, 1987
; Brotherhood, 1984
; Hawley et al., 1997
). Carbohydrate loading
 is a nutritional modification that results in an additional storage of glycogen in muscle fibers that can be approximately two to three times the normal level. As mentioned previously, the time to exhaustion in long-duration, relatively high-intensity activities is related to initial levels of muscle glycogen. Table 6.7
 details two carbohydrate-loading techniques commonly used.



TABLE 6.7
 Carbohydrate Loading









Carbohydrate Loading (Glycogen Supercompensation)
 A process of nutritional modification that results in an additional storage of glycogen in muscle fiber up to two to three times the normal levels.




One-Week Carbohydrate-Loading Technique


The original carbohydrate-loading technique was based on studies by Swedish investigators in the 1960s (Bergstrom et al., 1967
). This technique involved hard exercise to deplete muscle glycogen stores 1 week before the competitive event, followed by 3 days of hard training and 3 days of rest. During the first 3 days after the depletion exercise, the individual ate almost no carbohydrates, and then for the next 3 days, almost exclusively carbohydrates. This technique was effective but difficult and uncomfortable to follow.



Subsequent research has shown that neither the exhaustive glycogen depletion nor the 3 days of high-protein, high-fat diet is necessary to maximize muscle glycogen storage (

Sherman, 1983

,
 
1989

). Instead, the 1-week carbohydrate-loading technique (

Table 6.7

) emphasizes a slow downward taper in duration and/or intensity of the training regimen. This taper is accompanied by a diet that includes not less than 50% carbohydrate and increases to approximately 70%. An athlete already modifying his or her training diet to include high levels of carbohydrate will have very few changes to make.



Short Carbohydrate-Loading Technique


For an athlete who might not want the strong taper or rest component, a short technique is available (Table 6.7
). In this version, the athlete either completes a normal training session the day before carbohydrate loading (Bussau et al., 2002
) or a supramaximal short depletion routine on the day of carbohydrate loading (Fairchild et al., 2002
). Two studies exemplify this technique. In the first (Bussau et al., 2002
), a normal training day was followed by the ingestion of 10 g·kg BW−1
 of high glycemic index carbohydrates for the next 24 hour. In the second study (Fairchild et al., 2002
), the depletion exercise (after a 5 minutes warm-up) consisted of 150 seconds of cycling at 130%

​
 peak followed by a 30-second all-out sprint. The athletes then ingested 12 g·kg LBM−1
 of high glycemic index carbohydrates over the next 24 hours. In both studies, the preloaded glycogen level was well within normal concentrations of 80–120 mmol·kg−1
 wet weight (95 and 109 mmol·kg−1
 wet weight, respectively). Glycogen supercompensation levels should be close to 200 mmol·kg−1
 wet weight. After 24 hours of loading and inactivity, glycogen levels in these studies were 180 and 198 mmol·kg−1
 wet weight, respectively. Additionally, glycogen supercompensation took place in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle fiber types. Figure 6.8
 shows a scan of muscle fibers packed with glycogen following a short CHO loading protocol study (Fairchild et al., 2002
).
 Although the depletion exercise used in the one study was cycling, any modality should be effective. The Focus on Research: Clinically Relevant box describes the impact of increased glycogen storage on exercise performance. Obviously, each athlete needs to individually determine which technique works best for him/her by trying these techniques during training time trials or in less important competitions.

Fat Plus Carbohydrate-Loading Techniqu
e


One technique that does not seem to work is combining 1 day of carbohydrate loading with fat loading. In a simple fat-loading technique, individuals simply ingest a high-fat diet from 1 to 6 days before an endurance event. There is clear evidence (Burke and Hawley, 2002
; Helge, 2000
) that 1–3 days of fat loading by itself is detrimental to endurance performance. It is too short a time to increase the capacity for fat utilization, and the resting levels of muscle glycogen at the start of an event are lowered. To counteract these shortcomings, a strategy has emerged, which involves 5–6 days of fat loading (60–70% fat in the diet) followed by 1 day of carbohydrate loading (~90% CHO in the diet). This strategy has been shown to increase fat utilization at rest and during exercise, to increase muscle glycogen stores, and to reduce muscle glycogen utilization during exercise. However, as with the studies using high-fat diets in training, there has been no clear evidence of performance improvement.



The practice of carbohydrate loading does not appear in any way to adversely affect normal healthy individuals (

ADA, 1987

;
 
Goss and Karam, 1987

;
 
Sherman, 1983

,
 
1989

). Obviously, individuals with diabetes should consult with a physician before attempting carbohydrate loading. Supercompensation may actually be occurring daily in an athlete undergoing strenuous training who eats the suggested amounts of carbohydrate. When trained males and females ingest equal amounts of carbohydrate relative to LBM, glycogen supercompensation is equal (

James et al., 2001

). This means ingesting 10 g·kg LBM
−1
·d
−1
 (to equal 8 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
). Thus, a female must pay close attention to both total energy intake and relative carbohydrate intake when carbohydrate loading to get sufficient other nutrients. Menstrual cycle may influence the effectiveness of carbohydrate loading. Females have a greater capacity for storing glycogen during the luteal phase (days 14–28) than the follicular phase (days 1–14) probably due to the fluctuations in hormonal levels (

Sedlock, 2008

). Overall, in the studies cited in this section, there were “responders” (who improved) and “nonresponders” (who did not improve) to both fat loading and carbohydrate loading. Therefore, it must be reemphasized that each athlete should determine what benefits himself or herself most. There is currently not enough evidence to support carbohydrate loading in either children or older adults (

Nemet and Eliakim, 2009

;
 
Tarnopolsky, 2008

).




While carbohydrate loading is intended for endurance athletes, body builders often follow a version of the modified carbohydrate-loading technique (

Helms et al., 2014

;
 
Kroculick, 1988

). The primary difference is a restriction of water and sodium intake by body builders during the high-carbohydrate ingestion phase. This water restriction has nothing to do with energy requirements during competition. Since approximately 2.7 g of water are stored with each gram of glycogen, it is based on the belief that water will be sucked from beneath the skin for storage with glycogen and lead to increased muscle size and definition for competition. In addition, stored glycogen is said to result in a harder muscle. Evidence in support of this consequence is primarily anecdotal.




Results from the only available scientific study are presented in
 
Figure 6.9

. Nine male body builders had girth measurements taken after a normal dietary routine (55% CHO, 15% PRO, and 30% fat) and after a traditional carbohydrate-loading regimen (3 days of 10% CHO, 33% PRO, and 57% fat, followed by 3 days of 80% CHO, 15% PRO, and 5% fat). Identical weight-lifting workouts were followed during both dietary manipulations and before girth measurement. The trials were randomized. No measurement of muscle definition was made, but as the figure shows, the diet before testing had no effect on muscle girth measurements (

Balon et al., 1992

). It may be necessary to increase total caloric intake as well as the increase in percentage of CHO to achieve an impact on physique appearance. It may also be beneficial to increase the CHO content of the diet in the last several weeks prior to a competition. If CHO loading is to be used, a trial run before competition (once the competitor has nearly reached competition leanness) should be attempted to develop an individualized strategy for competition (

Helms et al., 2014

). Alarmingly, a case has been reported in which a young body builder in the course of the traditional carbohydrate loading developed low blood concentrations of potassium and phosphate, weakness in all four extremities, and rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscle tissue) (

Britschgi and Zünd, 1991

).

 Clinically Relevant





The Impact of Increased Glycogen Storage on Exercise Performance






In this study, well-trained male endurance cyclists completed two exercise trials separated by at least 4 days. Each trial consisted first of 2 hours of cycling at approximately 73%

​
. Every 20 minutes, an all-out 60-second sprint followed by 1 minute of unloaded cycling was interspersed. Immediately after the 2-hour ergometer ride, the athlete transferred to his own bike and completed a 1-hour time trial, blind to all data except elapsed time.







Dietary manipulation consisted of either 3 days of each athlete’s normal diet or 3 days of a high-carbohydrate diet. A standardized breakfast similar to what they would have eaten before a competition was ingested 3 hours before testing. During the 2-hour ride, each athlete drank 600 mL of a 10% glucose polymer solution and then only water during the time trial.








The results are shown in the accompanying graphs. Although the mean muscle glycogen level after the high-carbohydrate diet was not as high as seen in many studies (151 mmol·kg
−1
 wet weight vs. ~200 mmol·kg
−1
 wet weight), it was significantly higher than after the normal diet. This enabled the cyclists to maintain a significantly higher power output and a faster overall pace during the time trial. Interestingly, muscle glycogen levels after the time trial were similar between groups despite different starting values and different performances. This indicates that the additional stored glycogen was indeed utilized during the time trial. Furthermore, although the term glycogen depletion is often used, glycogen concentrations do not actually reach zero at exhaustion.

Pre-Event Mea
l


Considerations for the pre-event meal involve the meal’s timing and nutrient content. Most road races and other endurance events, unless scheduled for the convenience of a television broadcast such as during the Olympics, take place in the morning. Competing after an overnight fast is probably not effective for an athlete in any sport, but it is most detrimental for endurance athletes. Liver glycogen is the primary endogenous source of blood glucose, and an overnight fast reduces the liver’s supply of glycogen. Although it has been demonstrated that fat oxidation can be maximized when an individual exercises in a fasted state, a high-carbohydrate pre-event meal is generally accepted to benefit performance more than fasting (O’Reilly et al., 2010
). This is despite the fact that getting up early and eating can be inconvenient. Athletes who compete in the afternoon or evening can more easily time their meals.



Current recommendations for precompetition fuelling for endurance, team, and/or explosive power events lasting more than 1 hour are to ingest 1–4 g kg
−1
 of primarily CHO food 1–4 hours before the start. Fiber, protein, and fat should be minimized to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal issues during the event (

ACSM et al., 2016; Burke et al, 2011

). The absence or presence of gastrointestinal distress can make the difference between a PR (personal record) or a DNF (did not finish). In addition, the ingestion of a small amount of CHO in the form of gel, sports beans, or chews within 5 minutes prior to the start can be beneficial (

Volpe et al., 2013

). For example, when
 
Neufer et al. (1987)

 fed participants 45 g of either liquid carbohydrate, a candy bar, or flavored water containing no carbohydrate 5 minutes before exercise, total work performed on a cycle ergometer was significantly improved after both the liquid carbohydrate and candy bar compared with the flavored water. When a meal of 200 g of carbohydrate (cereal, bread, and fruit) was eaten 4 hours before exercise in addition to a candy bar 5 minutes before the exercise, total work performed on the cycle ergometer was significantly greater compared with all other trials

.




Theoretically, ingestion of carbohydrate from 1 hour to 5 minutes before exercise could be detrimental to performance for the following reasons. The ingestion of carbohydrate causes an increase in blood glucose. The increase of blood glucose causes a concomitant increase in insulin. Insulin favors the removal of blood glucose from the bloodstream, inhibits the release of glucose from the liver, and inhibits the mobilization of free fatty acids, which are used, along with carbohydrate, as fuel for exercise. These actions can cause hypoglycemia and may cause a greater dependency on muscle glycogen stores, depleting them at a faster rate. Despite the popular acceptance of this reasoning, the research literature has not supported the detrimental effects of meals within 1 hour of competition (

Burke and Read, 1989

;
 
Burke et al., 2011

;
 
Coyle, 1991

;
 
Hawley and Burke, 1997

;
 
Ormsbee et al., 2014

;
 
Williams and Serratosa, 2006

).




What type of carbohydrate should be ingested in the pre-event meal has been extensively investigated. Some studies have shown that low glycemic index meals have a beneficial impact. The common denominator in those studies is a combination of a greater rate of fat oxidation and more stable plasma glucose concentrations during exercise than after a HGI preexercise meal (

O’Reilly et al., 2010

;
 
Williams and Serratosa, 2006

;
 
Wu and Williams, 2006

). Additionally, a LGI pre-event meal produces a longer-lasting feeling of satiety than a HGI meal. However, other studies have shown that the achieved metabolic differences did not translate into improved performances. In addition, when CHO is consumed during the event, it negates the effect of the glycemic characteristics of the pre-event meal (

Donaldson et al., 2010

;
 
O’Reilly et al., 2010

). Therefore, the ingestion of a low glycemic index pre-event meal is likely to be most effective when it is difficult to consume carbohydrate during exercise (such as in some team sports) or the individual is sensitive to a hyperinsulinemic response to CHO (

Burke et al., 2011

).




This pre-event meal should consist of foods that the individual likes and tolerates well and should have been practiced during training.
 
Table 6.8

 summarizes this information.

Feeding during Exercise


When exercise begins, insulin release is suppressed, and catecholamine secretion increases. Both theoretically and experimentally, there is support for the ingestion of carbohydrates during exercise provided the activity is prolonged (>60 minutes) and at moderate to high intensities (50–85%

​
). Even small amounts of carbohydrates taken at 15- to 30-minute intervals have been found to
 prevent a decline in blood glucose and to delay fatigue during the latter portion of an endurance event longer than 1 hour. Note that fatigue can be caused by many factors, and carbohydrate feeding merely delays but does not prevent fatigue. Carbohydrate feedings during intermittent exercise such as soccer or basketball have also been shown to be beneficial (Burke and Read, 1989
; Cermak and van Loon, 2013
; Costill, 1988
; Coyle, 1991
; Phillips et al., 2011
; Williams and Serratosa, 2006
) although the opportunity to do so is difficult other than at half time.



As stated in the training portion of this chapter, the longer the endurance event, the more important the inclusion of a variety of CHO forms is. Recall that glucose is transported across the membrane of the small intestinal epithelium using the sodium-dependent glucose transporter SGLT1. This transporter becomes saturated when glucose intake is around 60 g·hr
−1
. Fructose is transported by GLUT5 and is independent of the saturation of SGLT1. Therefore, when glucose and fructose are ingested in combination using a 2:1 ratio of glucose to fructose, total delivery of CHO can be increased (

Baker and Jeukendrup, 2014

;
 
Cermak and van Loon, 2013

;
 
Jeukendrup, 2013

;
 
Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

). It does not matter whether the CHO is ingested as a liquid beverage (although this has the added advantage of providing hydration), solid, or gel. Thus, in general:







For endurance events lasting 30–75 minutes or explosive power events, either no exogenous CHO supplementation is recommended or at most a mouth rinse of a CHO beverage.






For endurance or intermittent sports lasting 1–2.5 hours, the optimal amount of CHO is approximately 30–60 g·hr−1
.






For events lasting longer than 2.5 hours, 90 g·hr−1
 should be ingested. Single or multiple transportable carbohydrates may be used for sessions under 2.5 hours. Over 2.5 hours, only multiple transportable carbohydrates are recommended (Jeukendrup, 2014
).






Research shows that beverages containing 2.5–10% carbohydrate are absorbed by the body as rapidly as water. A concentration of 6–8% is thought to be optimal (ACSM et al., 2009; Kreider et al., 2010
). Drinks containing less than 5% carbohydrate do not provide enough energy to enhance performance, and drinks exceeding 10% carbohydrate (such as most soft drinks/soda pop) are often detrimental since they tend to cause abdominal cramps, nausea, and diarrhea (Coleman, 1988
). One high-carbohydrate energy bar, 24 oz. of sports drink, and two packets of gel are equivalent. Depending on its composition, any of these can provide at least 30–60 g of carbohydrate per hour during endurance exercise.



In general, HGI foods are probably best for ingestion during exercise. They are rapidly digested and absorbed and are thus likely to maintain blood glucose levels. LGI carbohydrates are digested more slowly and thus may cause gastric distress and fail to maintain blood glucose levels (

Walton and Rhodes, 1997

). The type of GI consumed during exercise has no bearing on performance outcome, per se. The GL may be a better predictor of glycemic responses than GI alone. Some research suggests that it is the amount of CHO rather than the GI type that is the most crucial factor influencing subsequent endurance performance (

Donaldson et al., 2010

;
 
O’Reilly et al., 2010

).




A combination of CHO and protein does not improve performance beyond the ingestion of the carbohydrate alone (

van Loon, 2014

).



Fluid Ingestion during and after Exercise


The background and guidelines for fluid ingestion during and after exercise are discussed in Chapter 14
. Suffice it to say here that fluid intake is important for preserving thermoregulation and avoiding both dehydration and dilutional hyponatremia (loss of sodium). Individuals should develop a customized fluid replacement program during training to prevent dehydration. The goal is a body weight loss of less than 2% during activity. Table 6.8
 summarizes general recommendations as a starting point for an individualized hydration program (ACSM, 2007
).




Eating Disorders




Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria


Most individuals participating in fitness programs or athletics view nutrition as a partner with exercise to help them achieve their goals of health or successful competition. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. There appear to be circumstances under which exercise and sport participation constitute a risk factor for disordered eating. Disordered eating exists on a continuum from abnormal eating behaviors to clinically diagnosed eating disorders. Clinically diagnosed eating disorders
 are disturbances of eating habits or weight-control behavior that can result in significant impairment of physical health or psychosocial functioning (Smolak et al., 2000
; Sudi et al., 2004
).





Eating Disorders (ED)
 Disturbances of eating habits or weight-control behavior that can result in significant impairment of physical health or psychosocial functioning.





Of course, eating disorders do not occur only in physically active individuals, nor do all, or even most, physically active individuals have eating disorders. However, symptoms of eating disorders are more prevalent among adolescent and adult elite athletes than nonathletes (

Martinsen and Sundgot-Borgen, 2013

). In addition, a higher prevalence of eating disorders has been found among athletes competing in sports where leanness is advantageous compared with both athletes competing in sports where leanness is not particularly relevant and controls (

Torstveit et al., 2008

). Female athletes struggle more with eating disordered behaviors than do male athletes, but this may simply be because eating disorders are an underrecognized problem in male athletes. Male athletes are particularly vulnerable for eating disorders in the same categories of sports as females: (1) sports that emphasize aesthetics (gymnastics, dance, figure skating, diving, and bodybuilding); (2)

 gravitational sports where low body fat is advantageous (climbing, long-distance running, road cycling, and ski jumping); and (3) sports in which there is a need to make weight (wrestling, some martial arts, rowing, and horse racing). The culture of the latter weight class sports, in particular, encourages bingeing and purging (

Baum, 2006

). In the past, males were more likely to actually have been overweight or obese before their eating disorders, whereas females more often simply perceived themselves as such (

Sundgot-Borgen, 1993b

,
 
1994a

;
 
Thompson and Sherman, 1993

). More recently, there has been a rise in the number of young males who are preoccupied with their body image. This preoccupation has been labeled “
muscle dysmorphia
” or bigorexia and is characterized by a preoccupation with being lean and muscular to the point where it interferes with normal food intake, normal life activities, and reasonable exercise levels. Muscle dysmorphia is not listed by the
 
American Psychiatric Association (2013)

 as an eating disorder and has no formal diagnostic criteria. That does not make it any less of a concern, however. Muscle dysmorphia in males often involves both disordered eating and anabolic steroid abuse (

Baum, 2006

;
 
Goldfield et al., 2006

). Not all males with eating disorders exhibit muscle dysmorphia. Pathological weight control and eating disorders are also evident in fitness instructors, including personal trainers (

Höglund and Normén, 2002

;
 
Thompson and Sherman, 1993

). This not only puts these individuals at personal risk but also jeopardizes the healthy attitudes and sound body ideals they should be communicating to their clients.




The
 
American Psychiatric Association (2013)

 recognizes four major categories of clinically diagnosed eating disorders:




1.
 Anorexia nervosa (AN)




2.
 Binge eating disorder (BED)




3.
 Bulimia nervosa (BN)




4.
 Eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS)




The diagnostic criteria for AN and BN are listed in
 
Table 6.9

.
 Anorexia nervosa
, often referred to as the self-starvation syndrome, is characterized by marked self-induced weight loss and an intense fear of fatness.
 Binge eating disorder (BED)
 was added as a condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) (

American Psychiatric Association, 2013

) and is defined as recurring (at least once a week over a 3-month period) episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period of time than most people would under similar circumstances and feeling out of control and/or guilty about it. Obviously, this would not lead to loss of weight.
 Bulimia nervosa
 is marked by an unrealistic appraisal of body weight and/or shape and is manifested by alternating bingeing and purging behavior.
 Eating disorders not otherwise specified
 include conditions of disordered eating when the complete criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge eating, or bulimia nervosa are not met. Note that these definitions are from a psychiatric association, not from a nutritional or exercise professional association. Clinical eating disorders are psychiatric

 conditions that go beyond body weight/shape dissatisfaction and involve more than abnormal weight-control behaviors (

Beals and Meyer, 2007

). They are complex and multidimensional. Specifically, perfectionism, obsessiveness, harm avoidance, and low self-esteem have been found to accompany AN (

Bachner-Melman et al., 2006

). Such individuals have trouble identifying and expressing their emotions and have difficulty forming close interpersonal relationships (

Beals and Meyer, 2007

).






TABLE 6.9
 Diagnostic Criteria and/or Characteristics for Selected Eating Disorders







*
Absolute criteria have not been agreed upon.

; Currie and Morse (2005)
; Sundgot-Borgen (1994a
,1994b
).





Other eating problems are considered subclinical: they are a problem but do not meet formal diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder or show significant psychopathology. Athletes with eating disorders have been clinically observed to display less psychopathology than do nonathletes with eating disorders. For this reason, eating disorders in athletes may differ from eating disorders in nonathletes. The term
 anorexia athletica (AA)
 has been proposed to describe a subtype of anorexia, a form of EDNOS, or subclinical disorder that affects athletes or other active individuals (

Bachner-Melman et al., 2006

;
 
Sudi et al., 2004

;
 
Sundgot-Borgen, 1994a

,
 
1994b

). Anorexia athletica is characterized by a food intake less than that required to support the training regimen and a body weight at least 5% below normal. Additional characteristics of AA are included in
 
Table 6.9

. Despite years of research in this area, no definite criteria have been established for AA.






Anorexia Nervosa (AN)
 An eating disorder characterized by marked self-induced weight loss and an intense fear of fatness.



Binge Eating Disorder (BED)
 Recurring episodes of excessive eating and feeling out of control and/or guilty about it.



Bulimia Nervosa (BN)
 An eating disorder marked by an unrealistic appraisal of body weight and/or shape that is manifested by alternating bingeing and purging behavior.



Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS)
 Conditions of disordered eating that do not meet the complete criteria for AN, BED, or BN.



Anorexia Athletica (AA)
 An eating disorder that is characterized by a food intake less than that required to support the training regimen and by a body weight less than 95% of normal.





Individuals suffering from AA may exhibit a variety of symptoms, some of which are common to AN or BN (

Bachner-Melman et al., 2006

;
 
Sudi et al., 2004

;
 
Sundgot-Borgen, 1994a

,
 
1994b

). Typically, the initial reduction in body mass/fat by dieting and/or excessive exercising in AA is based on the performance goals, not body appearance or shape issues. Appearance concerns, however, can develop, especially if the athlete is not as successful in an aesthetic sport as anticipated or desired. The drive to lose weight can become a goal in itself, regardless of the negative impact on athletic performance. Weight cycling (repeated weight loss and regain) may occur, based on different seasonal degrees of training or the necessity to make weight weekly for competition. Finally, the abnormal eating behavior generally disappears when the athlete ends participation (

Sudi et al., 2004

).




The possible lack of a consistent underlying psychopathology and the possibility of reversal on cessation of competition do not mean that AA is not a serious problem or that it can just be ignored. Nor does it mean that an athlete cannot have AN, BED, or BN or underlying psychological issues where exercise dependence becomes an addiction, and obsessive-compulsive traits, body dysmorphic disorder, and substance dependence become apparent (

Currie and Morse, 2005

). Any and all of these conditions may overlap and coexist. AA is serious, and it needs to be dealt with.



Risk Factors


The specific causes of eating disorders are unknown (Sundgot-Borgen, 1994a
, 1994b
; Arthur-Cameselle and Quatromoni, 2014
). Risk factors are multifactorial and can be divided into predisposing factors such as genetics, psychological traits, and sociocultural factors; trigger factors such as comments about weight; and perpetuating factors, such as approval by the coach when weight is lost (Bratland-Sanda and Sundgot-Borgen, 2013
). Individuals who are conscientious and achievement oriented, who seek perfection, but who, at the same time, have a low self-esteem and a high need for approval seem psychologically predisposed for eating disorders. Eating disorders appear to run in families and are more strongly associated in identical than fraternal twins. By the same token, a cultural obsession with thinness may create a social predisposition, although it is not known why some young girls succumb to the pressure while most do not (Leon, 1991
; Sundgot-Borgen, 1994a
, Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2013
). Sports and exercise for fitness are not to blame for eating disorders (Currie and Morse, 2005
). However, the sports/fitness environment emphasizes performance and often demands, in fact or perception, an ideal body size, shape, weight, or composition both as a means to achieving high performance and, in aesthetic sports, as a major part of the performance itself (Thompson and Sherman, 1993
). Once a predisposed individual begins a very restrictive diet, a cycling, self-perpetuating, self-reinforcing process begins, and the individual is at great risk for developing an eating disorder.



Although no long-term prospective studies have been conducted, the following are suggested as possible risk factors for developing an eating disorder (

Bratland-Sanda and Sundgot-Borgen, 2013

;
 
Sundgot-Borgen, 1994b

;
 
Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2013

).




1.
 Dieting at an early age
. Dieting is a risk factor, especially if recommended by a coach. There is a continuum for dieting that can progress from healthy dieting for a gradual weight loss, to a restrictive diet, chronic dieting, frequent weight fluctuations, fasting, dehydration, and the use of laxatives, diuretics, vomiting, and pills that ultimately become disordered eating behavior or an eating disorder.




2.
 Unsupervised dieting
. Athletes rarely receive guidance from someone trained in nutrition and knowledgeable about their sports’ requirements. Those who are given such assistance often do not follow the advice.




3.
 Lack of acceptance of pubertal changes
. Young female athletes are often distressed at the bodily changes that occur as they mature—particularly menarche and the increasing levels of body fat. Many young athletes are also aware that a delayed menarche is often associated with athletic success (see
 
Chapter 016

).




4.
 Early sport-specific training
. Children often specialize in a specific sport at an early age. Being a generalist as a child athlete allows more options later—although realistically, that is hard to do if one wishes

 to compete on an elite national or international level. An individual’s somatotype (body type) greatly influences which sports she can successfully compete in. If this influence is disregarded, a young child may select a sport she enjoys (such as gymnastics) only to find that her body outgrows it.




5.
 A large increase in training volume accompanied by a significant weight loss
. Athletes do not always spontaneously increase their energy intake when energy expenditure increases. The athlete sees weight loss as good and has no incentive to eat more. Thus, a pattern of eating less and less to lose more and more weight is initiated.




6.
 Traumatic events
. Any traumatic event may be a risk factor, but typically, it is associated with an illness or injury that prevents training (and increases the fear of gaining weight) and/or the loss of a coach who the athlete sees as being vital to her career.




7.
 Personality.
 Some traits desired by coaches such as high achievement orientation potentially manifested as a desire to be leaner to improve sports performance and/or overcompliance involving excessive exercise can be confounding factors. Unfortunately, if some (weight loss or training) is good, more (weight loss or training) is not necessarily better.




8.
 Coaching behavior and real or perceived pressure from coaches and judges.
 The environment/team culture provided or allowed by the coach can either reduce or increase the risk of an eating disorder. In addition, comments on body composition or belief that judge’s evaluations are influenced by body composition have a great impact on athletes.




9.
 Weight regulations in some sports
. The goal of athletes competing in weight-class sports is often to have the lowest possible weight with the greatest possible strength. Extreme weight loss practices often occur before weigh-ins, and recovery before actual competition depends to some extent on the amount of time between the weigh-in and the competition. Frequent weight fluctuations could be a trigger for an eating disorder.



The Consequences of Eating Disorders


Energy availability (EA) is the amount of dietary energy remaining for all other metabolic processes after the energy cost of exercise training (relative to fat-free mass [FFM]) is subtracted from the daily energy intake. A value of 45 kcal·kg FFM−
1
·d−
1
 generally equates to energy balance in an adult. Low EA means that all other bodily systems must adjust to a reduced energy expenditure. Disordered eating or diagnosed eating disorders often underlie low EA. Low EA has negative physiological results. The term relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) syndrome has been coined to emphasize the consequences of low relative energy availability. Thus, relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S)
 is defined as a syndrome of impaired physiological function caused by low energy availability (Mountjoy et al., 2014
).





Relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S)
 A syndrome of impaired physiological and/or psychological function caused by low energy availability.





The consequences of RED-S and/or of an eating disorder can be dire. At the very least, the individual’s nutritional status is compromised.
 
Figure 6.10

 shows a representative sample of nutrient intake in a Norwegian study of elite female athletes (

Sundgot-Borgen, 1993a

). The control group (C) consisted of 30 athletes not classified as at risk for developing an eating disorder. However, 27% of those athletes were on a diet. Except for the bulimic group, all other groups had a lower total energy intake than recommended. The bulimic group’s diet also differed in composition from that of the other groups. They ate more fat (30% vs. 20%) and less protein (10% vs. 20%) than did the other groups but an equal

 amount of carbohydrates. Despite the same percentage of carbohydrates, only the bulimic group took in sufficient amounts of carbohydrates in grams per kilogram per day. Those with AN had the greatest nutritional disturbance. They were simply not ingesting enough of anything.










FIGURE 6.10
 Nutrient Intake in Elite Norwegian Female Athletes.

 Based on data from Sundgot-Borgen (1993a).





Although the bulimic group appears to be getting sufficient nutrients in terms of carbohydrates, protein, calcium, and iron, note that these values are prepurging intakes. Most of the BN group and one third of the AA group regularly vomited within 15 minutes of eating. Thus, the nutrients were ingested, but they were not absorbed. Individuals who purge by using diuretics or laxatives, in contrast, have minimal caloric loss but lose electrolytes and can become dehydrated.





Figure 6.11

 presents more of the consequence of RED-S although it is not exhaustive. The middle

 series of circles identify systems and functions that are impacted by insufficient energy availability; the outer series of circles presents some specific symptoms or results. Psychological, physiological/health, and fitness/performance characteristics can be negatively impacted. The impact of low energy availability on menstrual function and bone health (indicated by the Triad in the diagram) is detailed in “The Female Athlete Triad” section in
 
Chapter 016

. At times, the medical complications of eating disorders can become severe enough to cause death (

Brownell et al., 1992

). At the very least, athletes with eating disorders tend to have shorter careers characterized by inconsistent performances and recurrent injuries (

Currie and Morse, 2005

).

As a coach, physical educator, athletic trainer, or exercise leader, your role is to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. To this end, it is important to adhere to the following:



1.
 Become educated in all aspects of disordered eating/eating disorders and trained in how to communicate and intervene in an appropriate manner.




2.
 Be knowledgeable about how to optimize nutrition, body composition, and performance as well as the principles of growth, development, and maturation for both males and females.




3.
 Encourage youngsters to try a variety of sports. As much as possible, try to guide them into more than one sport experience where they can potentially be successful.




4.
 Provide access to a trained health professional or dietician who can supply realistic, healthy weight goals appropriate for each individual’s stage of maturation. If weight goals are called for at all, target weight ranges that allow for growth and development should be the norm. Allow for individual differences. Male exercise leaders, teachers, or coaches, in particular, must accept that females naturally have a higher percentage of body fat than males, even when both sexes train equally (

Thompson and Sherman, 1993

).




5.
 If weight and body composition are to be monitored, do it privately to prevent embarrassment and competitive weight loss. Do not post weights. Avoid all derogatory or teasing remarks about body size, shape, or weight. Do not always equate weight loss with good. Coaches should not be directly involved in any decision regarding weight or in actually weighing athletes (Sangenis et al., 2006;
 
Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2013

;
 
Thompson and Sherman, 1993

). However, it is critical that they build into the athletic program a system for assessment of athletes by other qualified personnel, not ignore eating disorder behavior, and unconditionally support athletes who need counseling or treatment. Treatment should be delivered by health professionals (

Arthur-Cameselle and Quatromoni, 2014

).




6.
 Provide proper nutritional guidance—if need be, in conjunction with a nutritionist—and emphasize nutrition for performance, not for weight and fat control.




7.
 Provide a realistic, progressive training program to which students, athletes, or fitness participants can gradually adjust in terms of energy input and energy output and avoid overtraining, illnesses, and injuries.




8.
 Monitor the relationship between any weight loss and performance. In the early stages of an eating disorder, performance may improve, which in turn may spur the individual on to greater weight loss. However, good performance does not always equate with good health and with too much weight loss, performance will eventually decline. The most common impetus to seek help with an eating disorder is experiencing the negative consequences of such behavior, including a drop in performance (

Arthur-Cameselle and Quatromoni, 2014

).




9.
 Provide an atmosphere that accepts and supports pubertal changes so that young participants will see them in a positive light.




10.
 Provide an atmosphere that values the individual and his or her health and well-being above athletic performance or appearance.




11.
 Be aware of the signs and symptoms of eating disorders and react to them. Do not assume, however, that merely talking to or educating individuals about eating disorders will be enough to prevent or cure them. Precisely the opposite can occur (

Thompson and Sherman, 1993

).




12.
 Seek professional help when dealing with any individual you suspect of having an eating disorder. The first response to being questioned is often denial, and this is best handled by a professional trained in this area. Do not delay. The sooner the treatment is started, the better the chances are for a full recovery (

Steen, 1994

;
 
Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2013

). Confrontation and/or intervention from a truly concerned individual, willing to listen and assist, is ultimately appreciated (

Arthur-Cameselle and Quatromoni, 2014

).




13.
 Never permit treatment to become secondary to an individual’s participation in sports or fitness activities.




Several proactive programs aimed at preventing disordered eating have been studied and shown encouraging results. One such program for fourth to sixth graders, called “Healthy Body Image: Teaching Kids to Eat and Love Their Bodies Too!” consists of 11 lessons. Compared to peers who did not take this class, participants had improved body image, self-image, lifestyle behaviors, awareness of the thinness culture message in the media, understanding of the biology of size and dieting, and awareness of body size prejudices (

Kater et al., 2002

). Two student-led curricula (Athletes Training and Learning to Avoid Steroids, and Athletes Targeting Healthy Exercise and Nutrition Alternatives) for high school males and

 females, respectively, have shown improved behaviors and intentions related to eating patterns and body-shaping drug use (

Elliot et al., 2006

;
 
Gabel, 2006

). All of these were short-term programs, and follow-up was needed, but they did show promise.




One study (

Martinsen et al., 2014

) examined the effect of a yearlong school-based intervention program that was intended to prevent the development of new cases of eating disorders in adolescent male and female elite athletes. The intervention covered six themes: motivation, self-esteem, nutrition, physiology, sport sciences, and illness prevention organized into lectures, practical and theoretical assignments, and teamwork exercises. At the end of the intervention year, for females, there were no new cases of eating disorder in the intervention high schools, while 13% of females developed an eating disorder in the control schools. Among males, there were also no new cases of eating disorder in the intervention schools but only one in a control school. Coaches also attended an intervention program emphasizing knowledge and strategies for healthy nutrition, healthy eating behavior, prevention, symptoms, identification, and management of eating disorders. Intervention coaches exhibited higher scores on total knowledge, weight regulation, and recognition and management of eating disorders than did control coaches (

Martinsen et al., 2015

).




To protect the health and well-being of athletes suffering from RED-S and/or specific eating disorders, sport risk assessments and return-to-play guidelines have been developed (

El Ghoch et al., 2013

;
 
Mountjoy et al., 2014

;
 
Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2013

).
 
Table 6.10

 provides the primary elements of these guidelines. Obviously, those athletes exhibiting both healthy eating habits and appropriate energy availability are fully cleared to play sports and are considered to be at low risk. Individuals who exhibit one or more of the characteristics in the middle column are considered to be at moderate risk. These individuals should be under treatment and may only train according to their treatment plan. Return to competition requires medical clearance. High-risk individuals have either diagnosed eating disorders, serious physical/psychological complications, extreme weight loss practices or meet at least three of the criterion in the moderate risk category. These individuals require supervision for training (when medically acceptable) and should not be competing.

SUMMARY





1.
 The five goals in an optimal training diet are to:




a.
 Provide caloric and nutrient requirements




b.
 Incorporate nutritional practices that promote good health




c.
 Achieve and maintain optimal body composition and playing weight




d. Promote recovery from training sessions and for physiological adaptations




e. Try variations of precompetition and competition fuel and fluid intake to determine bodily responses




2.
 A balanced nutritional diet for an adult is composed of sufficient calories to maintain acceptable body weight and composition, with 10–35% protein, 20–35% fat, and 45–65% carbohydrate; the Dietary Reference Intake/Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamins and minerals; and sufficient fluid for hydration. This is also adequate and probably optimal for all but hard-training elite, competitive athletes.




3.
 Active individuals who are satisfied with their body weight and composition must ingest sufficient calories to balance those expended. This diet should proportionally increase the nutrient intake

.




4.
 In order to maximize adaptations from training sessions, the exercise needs to rehydrate, replenish (muscle glycogen), and repair (muscle protein). This involves both carbohydrate and protein ingestion.




5.
 Recommended daily carbohydrate ingestion for training is on a sliding scale based on the duration and intensity of the training: for low-intensity, short duration exercise = 4.5–5 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
; for moderate exercise 1 hr·d
−1
 = 5–7 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
; for extreme endurance training 4–5 hr·d
−1
 = 8–12 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
.




6.
 Selection of the type of postexercise CHO should be based on the time available for replenishment and GI. The immediate postexercise feedings should consist of HGI foods to facilitate glycogen replenishment, with the following meals containing both high-glycemic and mixed-glycemic menus when time is short, while the GI of the CHO consumed during the immediate postexercise period might not be as important as simply ingesting a sufficient amount of CHO if a full 24 hours are available. When carbohydrate intake is insufficient (<1.2 g·kg
−1
·hr
−1
), the addition of amino acids and/or protein can be beneficial.




7.
 Recommended daily protein ingestion for training depends on the sport and the individual. These values include: 1.2–1.4 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 for endurance training, 1.2–1.7 (or even 2.0) g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 for team/intermittent sports, and 1.5–1.7 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 for power sports. Older individuals need 1.0–1.5 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 up from the RDA of 0.8 g·kg
−1
·d
−1
 for younger sedentary adults. This increased intake should not exceed 15% of the total caloric intake.




8.
 Protein ingestion should begin immediately postexercise at a rate of 0.25 g·kg
−1
, continue every 4–5 hours, and be topped off with 0.25 g·kg
−1
 prior to sleep.




9.
 A high-fat diet has no performance advantage for most individuals. However, active individuals should be ingesting 20–30% of their daily calories as fat.




10.
 Vitamins are important for the production of energy. However, there is no evidence that vitamin supplementation in an adequately nourished individual improves performance, speeds up recovery, or reduces injuries. Where deficiencies are present, supplementation to normal physiological levels can improve performance.




11.
 Supplementation of zinc, chromium, selenium, copper, iron, or any other micronutrient above normal levels does not appear to increase exercise performance. Iron supplementation given to individuals with iron deficiency anemia consistently improves performance, but supplementation should not be done unless needed clinically.




12.
 Supplementation of the macrominerals calcium and magnesium does not increase exercise performance. Phosphate loading may delay the onset of anaerobic metabolism effects.




13.
 A complete nutritional analysis by a trained nutritionist should precede any supplementation to determine need and safety.




14.
 The five goals of an optimal competitive diet are to:




a.
 Ensure adequate fuel supplies in the pre-event time span




b.
 Ensure adequate fuel supplies during the event, regardless of its duration




c.
 Facilitate temperature regulation by prevention of dehydration




d. Achieve desired weight classifications while maintaining fuel and water supplies




e. Avoid gastrointestinal discomfort during competition




15.
 Carbohydrate loading is beneficial for individuals competing in endurance events of at least 60–90 minutes at 65–85%


 ​
.




16.
 In the 1-week carbohydrate-loading technique, an individual increases the percentage of carbohydrate ingested from 50 to 70% while gradually tapering training the week before competition. The simplified carbohydrate-loading technique requires only a short supramaximal exercise bout followed by approximately 90% carbohydrate ingestion for 24 hours to achieve glycogen supercompensation. Both techniques are safe and effective.




17.
 A pre-event meal composed primarily of carbohydrate and accompanied by fluids is recommended 1–4 hours before competition; a small amount of carbohydrate may be ingested within 5 minutes of the event. During prolonged exercise, either moderate or HGI foods are suggested.




18.
 Carbohydrate beverage ingestion at 15- to 30-minute intervals during endurance activity can prevent a decline in glucose and delay fatigue. For endurance or intermittent sports lasting 1–2.5 hours, the optimal amount of either glucose or glucose plus fructose is 30–60 g·hr
−1
. For events lasting longer than 2.5 hours, 90 g·hr
−1
 of glucose plus fructose should be ingested. Beverages containing 6–8% of mixed carbohydrate type are recommended for optimal benefit. All carbohydrates ingested during an event should have a high glycemic index.




19.
 Three types of eating disorders are of great concern for personnel working with active individuals: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia athletica. Although there are technical differences among the three disorders, all involve a restriction of food intake or a purging of food ingested in a binge, a desire for more and more weight loss, and a denial of having a problem.




20.
 The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. More athletes than nonathletes suffer from eating disorders, and most cases occur in sports where low weight gives a competitive advantage, in aesthetic sports, or in sports requiring weight classifications. Far more females than males have eating disorders, but prevalence is increasing in males.




21.
 Personnel working with active individuals between the ages of 10 and 25 years should be aware of situations that are probably risk factors for an eating disorder, avoid practices that increase the risk, identify problems at an early state, and facilitate appropriate therapy.





Review Questions









1.
  List the goals for nutrition during training and the goals for nutrition during competition. Explain why they are different.




2.
  Make a table comparing a balanced diet for a sedentary individual and one for an active individual training for an endurance event, team or intermittent sport, or a power event. Include caloric intake, percentages, and grams per kilogram per day recommendations for the major nutrients, as well as similarities or differences in vitamin, mineral, and fluid ingestion.




3.
  Define the GI, and describe how foods are divided into high, moderate, and low categories. Using the GI, design an ideal snack to be eaten approximately 30 minutes after a century bike ride (100 mi), and design an ideal snack to be eaten during a day of hiking on the Appalachian Trail. Explain your choices.




4.
  Discuss the positive and negative aspects of a high-carbohydrate diet.




5.
  Discuss the situations in which an increase in protein above the RDA is advisable and situations in which such an increase is not advisable.




6.
  Describe a training situation and the theory behind when fat intake can be too low in that situation.




7.
  Compare the theory behind the use of carbohydrate loading for endurance athletes with the theory behind the use of carbohydrate loading for bodybuilders.




8.
  Compare the 1 week and simplified techniques of carbohydrate loading in terms of diet and exercise for endurance athletes.




9.
  Make a table of a comprehensive fluid and nutrient intake for pre-event, during-the-event, and postevent diets for a football player and a triathlete.




10.
  Define and list the criteria/characteristics of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia athletica.




11.
  Identify the risk factors for developing an eating disorder. Prepare a set of guidelines that could be used to counteract these risk factors or deal with the disorder early in its progression.




12.
  Discuss possible consequences of eating disorders.
