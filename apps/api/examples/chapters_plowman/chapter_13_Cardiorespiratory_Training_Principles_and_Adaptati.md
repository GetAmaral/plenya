Introduction





In the last decade, physical fitness
–centered exercise prescriptions, which emphasize continuous bouts of relatively vigorous exercise, have evolved (for the nonathlete) into public health recommendations for daily moderate-intensity physical activity
. Early scientific investigations that led to the development of training principles for the cardiovascular system almost always focused on the improvement of physical fitness, operationally defined as an improvement of maximal oxygen consumption (

). Such studies formed the basis for the guidelines developed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and first published in 1978 as “the recommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining fitness in healthy adults.” These guidelines were revised in 1998 and again in 2011 to “Quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: Guidance for prescribing exercise.” After 1978, these guidelines were increasingly applied not only to healthy adults intent on becoming more fit
 but also to individuals seeking only health benefits
 from exercise training.



Although evidence shows that health benefits accrue when fitness is improved, health and fitness are different goals, and exercise training and physical activity are different processes (

Plowman, 2005

). The quantity and quality of exercise required to develop or maintain cardiorespiratory fitness may not be (and probably is not) the same as the amount of physical activity required to improve and maintain cardiorespiratory health (

ACSM, 2011

;
 
Haskell, 1994

;
 
Haskell, 2005

;
 
Haskell et al., 2007

;
 
Nelson et al., 2007

). Furthermore, most exercise science or physical education majors and competitive athletes who want or need high levels of fitness can handle physically rigorous and time-consuming training programs. Such programs, however, carry a risk of injury and are often intimidating to those who are sedentary, elderly, or obese.




Studies also suggest that different physical activity recommendations are warranted for children and adolescents. Thus, an optimal cardiovascular training program—maximizing the benefit while minimizing the time, effort, and risk—varies with both the population and the goal.
 
Table 13.1

 summarizes recommendations for cardiorespiratory health and fitness from leading authorities.

Application of the Training Principles





This chapter focuses on cardiovascular fitness and cardiorespiratory function that can impact health. Thus, only the cardiovascular portion of the exercise prescription recommendations of the ACSM and the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) are discussed here for adults and children/adolescents. The emphasis will be on changes that accompany a change in 

. Additional information about physical fitness and physical activity in relation to cardiovascular disease is presented in Chapter 15
, Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and Physical Activity.



Obviously, there are other goals for exercise prescription and physical activity guidelines in addition to cardiovascular ones. There is also some overlap in the cardiovascular benefits of physical activity/exercise with other health and fitness areas, especially those pertaining to body weight/composition and metabolic function. Body weight aspects are discussed in the metabolic unit, and the recommendations for and benefits of resistance training, flexibility, and balance are discussed in the neuromuscular unit.




This first section of the chapter, focusing on how the training principles are applied for cardiovascular fitness, relies heavily on the cardiorespiratory portion of the 2011 ACSM guidelines for healthy adults.
 Cardiovascular fitness
 (also known as cardiorespiratory fitness) is defined as the ability to deliver and use oxygen during intense and prolonged exercise or work. Cardiovascular fitness is evaluated by measures of maximal oxygen consumption (


). Sustained exercise training programs using these principles to improve
 

 are rarely included in the daily activities of children and adolescents. However, in the absence of more specific exercise prescription guidelines for younger individuals, these guidelines are often applied to adolescent athletes and youngsters in scientific training studies (

Rowland, 2005

).






Cardiovascular Fitness
 The ability to deliver and use oxygen under the demands of intensive, prolonged exercise or work.



Cross-Training
 The development or maintenance of cardiovascular fitness by alternating between or concurrently training in two or more modalities.



Central Cardiovascular Adaptations
 Adaptations that occur in the heart that increase the ability to deliver oxygen.



Peripheral Cardiovascular Adaptations
 Adaptations that occur in the vasculature or muscles that increase the ability to extract oxygen.




Specificity


Any activity that involves large muscle groups and is sustained for prolonged periods of time has the potential to increase cardiorespiratory fitness. This includes such exercise modes as aerobics, bicycling, cross-country skiing, various forms of dancing, jogging, rollerblading, rowing, speed skating, stair-climbing or stepping, swimming, and walking. Sports involving high-energy, nonstop action, such as field hockey, lacrosse, and soccer, can also positively benefit the cardiovascular system (ACSM, 2011
; Pollock, 1973
).



Exercise is beneficial only if an individual participates in it. Therefore, for fitness participants, the choice of exercise modalities should be based on interest, availability, and minimal risk of injury. An individual who enjoys the activity is more likely to adhere to the program. Although jogging or running may be the most time-efficient way to achieve cardiorespiratory fitness, these activities are not enjoyable for many individuals. They also have a relatively high incidence of overuse injuries. Therefore, other options should be available in fitness programs.




Although many different modalities can improve cardiovascular function, the greatest improvements in performance occur in the modality used for training, that is, there is modality specificity. For example, individuals who train by swimming improve more in swimming than in running (

Magel et al., 1975

), and individuals who train by bicycling improve more in cycling than running (

Pechar et al., 1974

;
 
Roberts and Alspaugh, 1972

). Modality specificity has two important practical applications. First, to determine whether improvement is occurring, the individual should be tested in the modality used for training. Second, the more the individual is concerned with sports competition rather than fitness or rehabilitation, the more important the mode of exercise becomes. A competitive rower, for example, whether competing on open water or an indoor ergometer, should train mostly in that modality. Running, however, seems to be less specific than most other modalities; running forms the basis of many sports other than track or road races (

Pechar et al., 1974

;
 
Roberts and Alspaugh, 1972

;
 
Wilmore et al., 1980

).




Although modality specificity is important for competitive athletes, cross-training also has value. As used here, the term
 cross-training
 means the development or maintenance of cardiovascular fitness by training in two or more modalities either alternatively or concurrently. Two sets of athletes in particular are interested in cross-training: first, injured athletes, especially those with injuries associated with high-mileage running, who wish to prevent detraining and, second, an increasing number of athletes who participate in multisport competitions such as biathlons and triathlons and need to be conditioned in each.




Theoretically, both specificity and cross-training have value for a training program. Any form of aerobic endurance exercise affects both central and peripheral cardiovascular functioning.
 Central cardiovascular adaptations
 occur in the heart and contribute to an increased ability to deliver oxygen. Central cardiovascular adaptations are the same in all modalities when the heart is stressed to the same extent. Thus, many modalities can have the same overall training benefit by leading to central cardiovascular adaptations.




Peripheral cardiovascular adaptations
 occur in the vasculature or the muscles and contribute to an increased

 ability to extract oxygen. Peripheral cardiovascular adaptations are specific to the modality and the specific muscles used in that exercise. For example, additional capillaries will form to carry oxygen to habitually active muscles but not to habitually inactive ones. Other factors within exercising muscles such as mitochondrial density and enzyme activity also affect the body’s ability to reach a high
 

. Specificity of modality operates because peripheral adaptations occur in the muscles that are used in the training. Thus, the specific activity— or closely related activities that mimic the muscle action of the primary sport—are needed to maximize peripheral adaptations. Examples of mimicking muscle action include side sliding or cycling for speed skating and water running in a flotation vest for jogging or running.





Table 13.2

 lists several situations, in addition to the maintenance of fitness when injured, in which cross-training may be beneficial (

Kibler and Chandler, 1994

;
 
O’Toole, 1992

). Note that multisport athletes may or may not be limited to the sports in which they are competing. For example, although a duathlete needs to train for both running and cycling, this training will have the benefits of both specificity and cross-training. In addition, this athlete may also cross-train by doing other activities such as rollerblading or speed skating. Note also that cross-training can be recommended at any time for a fitness participant to help avoid physiological monotony and mental boredom. For a healthy competitive athlete, the value of cross-training is modest during the season. Cross-training is most valuable for single-sport competitive athletes during the transition (active rest) phase but may also be beneficial during the general preparation phase of periodization.

Overload


There is a dose-response association between the volume of exercise and health/fitness outcomes; the greater the amount of physical activity, the greater the health/fitness benefits (ACSM, 2014
). Exercise volume is the product of frequency, intensity, and time (duration) of exercise. An increase in volume provides an overload to the cardiovascular system that results in improved health/fitness. Overload of the cardiovascular system is achieved by manipulating the intensity, duration, and frequency of the training bouts. These variables are easily remembered by the acronym FIT (F, frequency; I, intensity; and T, time or duration). Figure 13.1
 presents the results of a study in which the components of overload were investigated relative to their effect on changes in 

. As the most critical component, intensity will be discussed first.

Intensity



Figure 13.1A
 shows the relationship between change (∆) in 

 and exercise intensity. In general, as exercise intensity increases, so do improvements in 

. The greatest amount of improvement in 

 is seen following training programs that utilize exercise intensities of 90–100% 

. In order to achieve such high-intensity training, individuals may alternate work and rest intervals (interval training). At exercise levels greater than 100% (supramaximal exercise), in which the total amount of training that can be performed decreases, improvement in 

 is somewhat less than is seen at 90–100% 

.



Intensity, both alone and in conjunction with duration, is very important for improving
 

. Intensity may be described in relation to heart rate, oxygen consumption, or rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Laboratory studies typically use
 

 for determining intensity, but heart rate and RPE are more practical for individuals outside the laboratory.
 
Table 13.3

 includes techniques used to classify intensity and suggested percentages for very light to near maximal activity (

ACSM, 2014

;
 
Mann et al., 2013

). Note that these percentages and classifications are intended to be used when the exercise duration is 20–60 minutes and the frequency is 3–5 d·wk
−1
.

 Classification of Intensity of Exercise Based on 20 to 60 Minutes of Endurance Training






HEART RATE METHODS Exercise intensity can be expressed as a percentage of either maximal heart rate (%HRmax) or heart rate reserve (%HRR). The %HRR method may be preferable because it reflects the rate of energy expenditure during exercise well, and because exercise intensity can be underestimated or overestimated when using %HRmax (ACSM, 2011
). Both techniques, explained below, require maximal heart rate to be known or estimated. The methods are most accurate if the maximal heart rate is actually measured during an incremental exercise test to maximum. If such a test cannot be performed, maximal heart rate can be estimated. ACSM recommends the following traditional, empirically based, easy formula using age despite the equation’s large (±12–15 b·min−1
) standard deviation (ACSM, 2011
; Wallace, 2006
). This large standard deviation, based on population
 averages, means that the calculated value may either overestimate (in individuals over 40 years) or underestimate (in individuals under 40 years) the true HRmax by as much as 12–15 b·min−1
 (ACSM, 2014
; Miller et al., 1993
; Wallace, 2006
):


13.1a




For obese individuals, the following equation is more accurate (

Miller et al., 1993

):



13.1b




For older adults, the following equation is more accurate (

Tanaka et al., 2001

):



13.1c




As indicated in
 
Chapter 12

, maximal heart rate is independent of age between the growing years of 6 and 16. This means that the 220 − age formula cannot be used for youngsters at this age (

Rowland, 2005

). During this age span for both boys and girls, the average HRmax resulting from treadmill running is 200–205 b·min
−1
. Values obtained during walking and cycling are typically 5–10 b·min
−1
 lower at maximum. As with adults, measured values are always preferable but may not be practical. Therefore, the value estimated for HRmax for children and young adolescents should depend on modality rather than age.







Example






Calculate the predicted or estimated HRmax for a 28-year-old female with a normal body composition.











If the female is obese, her estimated maximal heart rate is











Once the maximal heart rate is known or estimated, the %HRmax is calculated as follows
:

1.
 Determine the desired intensity of the workout.




2.
 Use
 
Table 13.3

 to find the %HRmax associated with the desired exercise intensity.




3.
 Multiply the percentages (as decimals) times the HRmax.







Example






Determine the appropriate HR training range for a moderate workout for a nonobese 28-year-old using the HRmax.





1.
 Determine the HRmax:

220 − 28 = 192 b⋅min
− 1




2.
 Determine the desired intensity of the workout.
 
Table 13.3

 shows 64–76% of HRmax corresponds to a moderate workout.




3.
 Multiply the percentages (as decimals) times the HRmax for the upper and lower exercise limits. Thus:










Therefore, an HR of 123 b·min
−1
 represents 64% of HRmax and an HR of 146 b·min
−1
 represents 76% of HRmax. To exercise between 64% and 76% of HRmax, a moderate workload, this individual should keep the heart rate between 123 and 146 b·min
−1
.








It is always best to provide the potential exerciser with a target heart rate range rather than a threshold heart rate. In fact, the term threshold may be a misnomer since no particular percentage has been shown to be a minimally necessary threshold for all individuals in all situations (

Haskell, 1994

). Evidence of a minimum threshold is supported in some, but not all, studies and may be related to the initial fitness level of the individual, the precise program followed, and individual variability of response (

ACSM, 2011

). Additionally, a range allows for the heart rate drift that occurs in moderate to heavy exercise after about 30 minutes and for variations in weather, terrain, fluid replacement, and other influences. The upper limit serves as a boundary against overexertion.




Alternatively, a target heart rate range can be calculated as a percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR), a technique also called the
 Karvonen
 method. It involves additional information and calculations but has the advantage of considering resting heart rate. The steps are as follows:




1.
 Determine the heart rate reserve (HRR) by subtracting the resting heart rate from the maximal heart rate:








  (13.3)






The resting heart rate is best determined when the individual is truly resting, such as immediately on awakening in the morning. However, for purposes of exercise prescription, this can be a seated or standing resting heart rate, depending on the exercise posture. Heart rates taken before an exercise test are anticipatory, not resting, and are higher than actual resting heart rate.



2.
 Choose the desired intensity of the workout.




3.
 Use
 
Table 13.3

 to find the %HRR associated with the desired exercise intensity.




4.
 Multiply the percentages (as decimals) for the upper and lower exercise limits by the HRR and add RHR using Equation 13.4.








  (13.4)







Example






Determine the appropriate HR range for a moderate workout for a normal-weight 28-year-old using the HRR method, assuming an RHR of 80 b·min−1
.





1.
 Determine the HRR:

192 b⋅min
−1
 − 80 b⋅min
−1
 = 112 b⋅min
−1




2.
 Determine the desired intensity of the workout. Again, using
 
Table 13.3

, 40–59% of HRR corresponds to a moderate workout. This reinforces the point that the %HRmax does not equal %HRR.




3.
 Multiply the percentages (as decimals) for the upper and lower exercise limits by the HRR. Thus:








4.
 Add RHR as follows:










Therefore, an HR of 125 b·min
−1
 represents 40% of HRR and an HR of 146 b·min
−1
 represents 59% of HRR. So, in order to be exercising between 40% and 59% of HRR, a moderate workload, this individual should keep the heart rate between 125 and 146 b·min
−1

.







This heart rate range (125–146 b·min−1
) is only slightly different from the one calculated by using %HRmax (123–146 b·min−1
), but the %HRR technique has the advantage of taking into account any training adaptations that occur in resting heart rate for future adjustments and is more closely tied with energy expenditure.



Work through the problem presented in the
 
Check Your Comprehension 1

 box, paying careful attention to the influence of resting heart rate when determining the training heart rate range using the heart rate reserve (Karvonen) method. Check your answer in Appendix C.




Maximal heart rate declines in a rectilinear fashion with advancing age in adults. Thus, the heart rate needed to achieve a given intensity level, calculated by either the maximal heart rate or heart rate reserve method, decreases with age.







CHECK YOUR COMPREHENSION 1






Calculate the target HR range for a light workout for two normal-weight individuals, using the %HRmax and %HRR methods and the following information.










OXYGEN CONSUMPTION/% R METHODS In a laboratory setting where an individual has been tested for 

 and equipment is available for monitoring 

 during training, %

R may be used to prescribe exercise intensity. Oxygen reserve is parallel to heart rate reserve in that it is the difference between a resting and maximal value. It is calculated according to the formula:


13.5 




Target exercise oxygen consumption is then determined by the equation:

 to find the %

.




4.
 Add the resting oxygen consumption to the obtained values. Note that this may be an individually measured value or the estimated 3.5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 that represents 1 MET.




5.
 Because oxygen drifts, as does heart rate, it is best to use a target range.




Basing the intensity of a workout on %


R is not very practical because most people do not have access to the needed equipment. However, the technique can be modified for individuals who wish to use it. First, one can use the formula in Appendix B (The Calculation of Oxygen Consumed Using Mechanical Work or Speed of Movement) to solve for the workload (velocity of level or inclined walking or running; resistance for arm cranking or leg cycling; height or cadence for bench stepping). Then the prescription can be based on minutes per mile, cadence of stepping at a particular height, or load setting at a specific revolutions per minute pace. Because the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise is higher for children and changes as they age and grow, this technique is rarely used for children (

Strong et al., 2005

).




A second practical use of the
 

R approach is based on the direct relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption. Look closely again at
 
Table 13.3

. Note that the column for %


R is also the column for %HRR; that is, any given %HRR has an equivalent %


R in adults. For example, an adult who is working at 50% HRR is also working at 50%
 

R. Therefore, heart rate can be used to estimate oxygen consumption when an individual is training or competing. The equivalency between %


R and %HRR has been demonstrated experimentally in both young and elderly adult males and females and for the modalities of cycle ergometry and treadmill walking and running (

Swain, 2000

) but is not absolute (

Mann et al., 2013

).




Although there is also a rectilinear relationship between %HRR and %


R in children and adolescents, this relationship in not the same as for adults. In children

 and adolescents, the two percentages are not equal. In one study, 50–85%
 

R was found to equate with 60–89% HRR in boy and girls 10–17 years of age (

Hui and Chan, 2006

). Therefore, it is probably best to simply use either %HRmax or %HRR when prescribing exercise intensity for children and adolescents, and not make any equivalency assumption with %


R.

RATING OF PERCEIVED EXERTION METHODS The third way exercise intensity can be prescribed is by a subjective impression of overall effort, strain, and fatigue during the activity. This impression is known as a rating of perceived exertion
 (RPE). Although RPE can be used alone as a prescriptive method, it is best used to fine-tune an exercise prescription (ACSM, 2011
; 2014
). Perceived exertion is typically measured using either Borg’s 6–20 RPE scale or the revised 0–10+ Category Ratio Scale (Borg, 1998
). Table 13.5
 presents and compares both scales. The RPE scale is designed so that these perceptual ratings rise in a rectilinear fashion with heart rate, oxygen consumption, and mechanical workload
 during incremental exercise; thus, it is the primary scale used for cardiovascular exercise prescription (Table 13.3
). The CR10 scale increases in a positively accelerating curvilinear fashion and closely parallels the physiological responses of pulmonary ventilation and blood lactate. Chapter 5
 describes the use of these scales for metabolic exercise prescription.



TABLE 13.5
 Scales for Ratings of Perceived Exertion







Both the Borg RPE and CR10 scales are intended for use with postpubertal adolescents and adults. Because children (~6–12 years) have difficulty consistently assigning numbers to words or phrases to describe their exercise-related feelings,
 
Robertson et al. (2002)

 developed the Children’s OMNI Scale of Perceived Exertion. The OMNI Scale uses numerical, pictorial, and verbal descriptors. The original scale, depicted in
 
Figure 13.2

, was validated for cycling activity. Since then, variations have been developed for walking/running (

Utter et al., 2002

) and stepping (

Robertson et al., 2005

).

 Children have been shown to be able to self-regulate their cycling exercise intensity using the OMNI Scale (

Robertson et al., 2002

). In addition, observers can determine children’s exercise intensity using the OMNI Scale (

Robertson et al., 2006

). This could be very helpful for teachers.

 have been derived from and are intended for use with land-based activities in moderate environments.

 Clinically Relevant





Ratings of Perceived Exertion and Environmental Conditions






Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a useful, common way to assist in exercise intensity prescription. Note, however, that the estimation of RPE (when exercisers are asked how hard they feel they are exercising) and actual physiological responses to exercise are affected by environmental conditions. Both HR and RPE are higher when exercise is performed in a hot environment (or while wearing clothing that interferes with heat dissipation) compared to a thermoneutral environment. The relationship between HR and RPE is also affected by environmental conditions. At any given RPE, HR is 10–15 b·min−1
 higher in the heat (Maw et al., 1993
). When exercisers are instructed to produce a given exercise intensity based on a specific RPE, they usually automatically adjust the exercise intensity to environmental conditions. For example, running at 8 min·mi−1
 in thermal neutral conditions may elicit an RPE estimation of 13. However, in hot humid conditions, an individual may only run at 9 min·mi−1
 at an RPE of 13.











Whether a water activity is performed horizontally, as in swimming, or vertically, as in running or water aerobics, postural and pressure changes shift the blood volume centrally and cause changes in blood pressure, cardiac output, resistance, and respiration. Although the magnitude of changes in the cardiovascular system vary considerably among individuals, the most consistent changes are lower submaximal HR (8–12 b·min
−1
) at any given
 

, a lower HRmax (~15 b·min
−1
), and a lower
 

 when exercise is performed in the water. A greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism is evident, and the RPE is higher in water than at the same workload on land (

Svedenhag and Seger, 1992

). The lower HR is probably a compensation for the increased stroke volume when blood is shifted centrally. As a result, the HR prescription should be about 10% lower for water workouts than for land-based workouts. For example, if an individual normally works out at 75% HRmax on land, the prescription for an equivalent workout in the water should be 65% HRmax. Another way to achieve the adjustment, if an estimated HRmax is used, is to start with 205 b·min
−1
 minus age rather than 220 b·min
−1
 minus age. Either of these changes should effectively reduce the RPE as well.




Regardless of the method chosen to prescribe exercise intensity, always consider three factors:




1.
 Exercise intensity should generally be prescribed within a range. Many activities require different levels of exertion throughout the activity. This is particularly true of games and athletic activities, but it also applies to activities like jogging and bicycling, in which changes in terrain can greatly affect exertion. In addition, a range allows for cardiovascular and oxygen consumption drifts during prolonged exercise.




2.
 Exercise intensity must be considered in conjunction with duration and frequency.




a.
 Intensity cannot be prescribed without regard to duration. These two variables are inversely related: In general, the more intense an activity is, the shorter it should be.




b.
 The appropriate intensity of exercise also depends on the individual’s fitness level and, to some extent, the point within his or her fitness program. Individuals should begin an exercise program at a low exercise intensity and gradually increase intensity in a steploading progression until the desired level is achieved.




3.
 Using heart rate or perceived exertion to monitor training sessions, rather than merely time over distance, allows the influence of weather, terrain, surfaces, and the way the individual is responding to be taken into account when assessing the person’s adaptation to a training program.



Duration/Time (or Quantity)


As shown in Figure 13.1B
, improvements in 

 can be achieved when exercise is sustained for durations of 15–45 minutes (Wenger and Bell, 1986
). Slightly greater improvements are achieved from longer sessions (35–45 minutes) than from shorter sessions (either 15–25 or 25–35 minutes). The current guidelines for public health (Table 13.1
) reflect these results and recommend 20–60 minutes per day for optimal improvement. However, the 20- to 60-minute recommendation does not mean that exercise sessions less than 20 minutes are not valuable for 

 or health benefits or that at least 20 minutes must be accumulated during one exercise session. Exercise bouts of 10 minutes are acceptable if the individual accumulates at least 20–60 minutes for the day, 3–5 d·wk−1
 (ACSM, 2011
; De Busk et al., 1990
).



Thus, for individuals who claim they do not have time to exercise, suggesting a 10-minute brisk walk in the morning (perhaps to work or walking the kids to school), at noon (to a favorite restaurant and back), and in the evening (perhaps walking to a movie or taking the dog for a walk) might make it easier to achieve a total of 30 minutes of activity. The benefit of split sessions is particularly important for those in rehabilitation programs. An injured person may simply not be able to exercise for a long period, while short bouts may be possible spread throughout the day.




Similarly, although it is most often the case in practice, the duration guidelines do not mean that the exercise must be continuous within any single session. The technique of interval training (alternating predetermined periods of exercise and rest) often used by athletes can be very effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness (

ACSM, 2011

). Several recent reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that compared with relatively long-duration continuous moderate exercise, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can result in an equal or higher improvement in cardiovascular fitness and health in a much shorter period of time. As little as 3 high-intensity interval sessions per week, involving ≤10 minutes of intense exercise in a 30-minute exercise session (including warm-up, recovery between intervals, and cooldown) has been shown to improve aerobic capacity and markers of disease risk in both healthy individuals and individuals with cardiovascular disorders. Additional research is needed to evaluate the safety and long-term benefits of such low-volume, short-duration high-intensity interval training in comparison with traditional training guidelines (Gillen and Gibala, 2014; Gist et al., 2013; Kessler et al., 2012; Weston et al., 2014).




Pedometer step counts are another

 way of assessing the quantity of exercise. Attainment of 10,000 or more steps per day has been recommended as an exercise prescription, but this recommendation needs further study in different populations and with a variety of health outcomes taking into account the intensity of the steps (

ACSM, 2014

). Recent studies suggest that fewer than 10,000 steps per day may provide health benefits. Moderate-intensity walking (at ~100 steps·min
−1
) for 30 minutes equates to 3,000–4,000 steps and can be used as a realistic minimal daily goal. Achieving pedometer step counts of ≥7,000 steps per day is associated with meeting exercise targets (

ACSM, 2011

). Activity monitors, such as Fitbit and Garmin, appear to be effective tools for promoting physical activity and have gained widespread acceptance (

Figure 13.3

).










FIGURE 13.3
 Activity Monitors Are Widely Available and Heavily Marketed.





Frequency


If the total work done or the number of exercise sessions is held constant, there is basically no difference in the improvement of 

 over 2, 3, 4, or 5 days (Pollock, 1973
). However, when these conditions are not adhered to, there does seem to be an advantage to more frequent training. As Figure 13.1C
 shows, the improvement in 

 is proportional to the number of training sessions per week (Wenger and Bell, 1986
). In general, training fewer than 2 d·wk−1
 did not result in improvements in 

. Likewise, further improvement in 

 was not meaningful when exercise participation was increased from 4 to 5 days a week. Although the graph in Figure 13.1C
 reveals that there is the potential for further improvement in 

 if a 6th day of training is added, it is not generally recommended for those pursuing fitness goals because of a higher incidence of injury and fatigue. The optimal frequency for improving 

 for all intensities appears to be 4 d·wk−1
.



The ACSM (

2011

,
 
2014

) recommendation for healthy individuals is a frequency of 3–5 with moderated intensity being done 5 d·wk
−1
 or vigorous done 3 d·wk
−1
 with the assumption that these days are nonconsecutive. However, individuals at very low fitness levels may start a program of only 2 d·wk
−1
 if they are attempting to meet the ACSM intensity and duration guidelines. Athletes in training may train 6 d·wk
−1
 as a way of increasing their total training volume. In this case, “easy” and “hard” days should be interspersed within most microcycles. Cross-training may also be employed. A special case is the “weekend warrior,” that is, the individual who accumulates a large volume of physical activity in a 2-day weekend. Existing evidence supports the possibility of benefit, although the injury risks are unknown (

ACSM, 2011

).



Individualization


Fitness programs should be individualized for participants. Not only do individual goals vary, but individuals also respond to and adapt to exercise differently. One of the major determinants of the individual’s response is genetics. Another major determinant is initial fitness level. Figure 13.1D
 clearly shows that independent of frequency, intensity, or duration, the greatest improvements in 

 occur in individuals with the lowest initial fitness level. Thus, both absolute and relative increases in 

 are inversely related to one’s initial fitness level. Although improvements in 

 are smallest in highly fit individuals, at this level, small changes may have a significant influence on performance, because many athletic events are won by fractions of a second.



The initial fitness level generalization also applies to health benefits. Health benefits are greatest when a person moves from a low fitness to a moderately fit category. Most sedentary individuals can accomplish this if they participate in a regular, low-to-moderate–endurance exercise program (

Haskell, 1994

).



Rest/Recovery/Adaptation


Training programs can be divided into initial, improvement, and maintenance stages. The initial stage usually lasts 1–6 weeks, although this varies considerably among individuals. This stage should include low-level aerobic activities that cause a minimum of muscle soreness or discomfort. It is often prudent to begin an exercise program at an intensity lower than the desired exercise range (40–59% HRR). The aerobic exercise session should last at least 10 minutes and gradually become longer by 5–10 minutes every 1–2 weeks over the first 4–6 weeks (ACSM, 2014
). For individuals at very low levels of fitness, a discontinuous or interval format training
 program may be warranted, using several repetitions of exercise, each lasting 2–5 minutes. Rest periods between the intervals reduce the overall stress on the individual by allowing intermittent recovery. Frequency may vary from short, light daily activity to longer exercise sessions two or three times per week. Adaptation occurs during the off days. An important part of this stage is helping the individual achieve the “habit” of exercise and orthopedically adapt to workouts. Soreness, discomfort, and injury should be avoided to encourage the individual to continue.



During the improvement stage, significant changes in physiological function indicate that the body is adapting to the stress of the training program. Again, the individual adapts during rest days when the body is allowed to recover. Adaptation has occurred when the same amount of work is accomplished in less time, when the same amount of work is accomplished with less physiological (homeostatic) disruption, when the same amount of work is accomplished with a lower perception of fatigue or exertion, or when more work is accomplished. Once the body has adapted to the stress of exercise, progression is necessary to induce additional adaptations, or maintenance is required to preserve the adaptations.



Progression


Once adaptation occurs, the workload must be increased for further improvement to occur. The workload can be increased by manipulating the frequency, intensity, and duration of the exercise. Increasing any of these variables effectively increases the volume of exercise and thus provides the overload necessary for further adaptation. The rate of progression depends on the individual’s needs or goals, fitness level, health status, exercise tolerance, and age but should always be done in a steploading fashion of 2–3 weeks of increase followed by a decrease for recovery and regeneration before increasing training volume again.



The improvement stage of a training program typically lasts 4–8 months and is characterized by relatively rapid progression. For an individual with a low fitness level, the progression from a discontinuous activity to a continuous activity should occur first. Then the duration of the activity should be increased. This increase in duration should not exceed 20% per week until 20–30 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity activity can be completed, and 10% per week thereafter. Frequency can then be increased. Intensity should be the last variable to be increased. Adjustments of no more than 5% HRR every six exercise sessions (1.5–2 weeks) are well tolerated.




The principles of adaptation and progression are intertwined. Adaptation and progression may be repeated several times until the desired level of fitness or performance is achieved. Each time an exercise program is modified, there will be a period of adaptation that may be followed by further progression if desired.



Maintenance


Athletes often vary their training levels according to a general preparation phase (off-season), specific preparation phase (preseason), competitive phase (in-season), and transition phase (active rest) as described in the periodization section in Chapter 1
. In transition and competitive phases, they can shift to a maintenance schedule. For rehabilitation and fitness participants, maintenance typically begins after the first 4–8 months of training. Reaching the maintenance stage indicates that the individual has achieved a personally acceptable level of cardiorespiratory fitness and is no longer interested in increasing the conditioning load.



After attaining a desired level of aerobic fitness, this level can be maintained either by continuing the same volume of exercise or by decreasing the volume of training, as long as intensity is maintained.
 
Figure 13.4

 shows the results of research that investigated changes in
 

 with 10 weeks of relatively intense interval training and a subsequent 15-week reduction in training frequency (

Figure 13.4A

), duration (

Figure 13.4B

), or intensity (

Figure 13.4C

) (

Hickson and Rosenkoetter, 1981

;
 
Hickson et al., 1982

,
 
1985

). When training frequency was reduced from 6 d·wk
−1
 to 4 or 2 d·wk
−1
 and intensity and duration were held constant, training-induced improvements in
 

 were maintained. Similarly, when training duration was reduced from 40 to 26 or 13 minutes, improvements in
 

 were maintained or continued to improve. However, when intensity was reduced by two thirds, improvements in
 

 were not maintained. These results indicate that intensity plays a primary role in maintaining cardiovascular fitness. Thus, although the total volume of exercise is most important for attaining a given fitness level, intensity is most important for maintaining the achieved fitness level. That is, in general, more exercise is required to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and health than is required to maintain the resultant improvements (

ACSM, 2011

).

During the maintenance phase of a training program, cross-training is particularly beneficial, especially on days when a high-intensity workout is not called for. For example, one study divided endurance-trained runners into three groups. One third continued to train by running, one third trained on a cycle ergometer, and one third trained by deep water running. The intensity, frequency, and duration of workouts in each modality were equal. After 6 weeks, performance in a 2-mi run had improved slightly (~1%) in all three groups (

Eyestone et al., 1993

). Thus, running performance was maintained by each of the modalities. On the other hand, arm ergometer training has not been shown to maintain training benefits derived from leg ergometer activity (

Pate et al., 1978

). Apparently, the closer the activities are in terms of muscle action, the greater the potential maintenance benefit of cross-training.



Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


Sometimes, an individual in training may exhibit a performance or physiological decrement (retrogression)
 or fail to improve (plateau), despite progression of the training program. When such a pattern occurs, it is important to check for other signs of overtraining (see Chapter 22
). A shift in training emphasis or the inclusion of more easy days is warranted. Remember that a reduction in the frequency of training does not necessarily lead to detraining and may actually enhance performance.



If training is discontinued for a significant period of time, detraining will occur. This principle, often referred to as the reversibility concept, holds that when a training program is stopped or reduced, body systems readjust in accordance with the decreased physiological stimuli. Increases in
 

 with low-to-moderate exercise programs are completely reversed after training is stopped. Values of
 

 decrease rapidly during a month of detraining, followed by a slower rate of decline during the 2nd and 3rd month (

Bloomfield and Coyle, 1993

).



Warm-Up and Cooldown


A warm-up period allows the body to adjust to the cardiovascular demands of exercise. At rest, the skeletal muscles receive about 15–20% of the blood pumped from the heart; during moderate exercise, they receive approximately 70%. This increased blood flow is important for warming the body since the blood carries heat from the metabolically active muscle to the rest of the body.



A warm-up period of 5–10 minutes at light to moderate intensity should precede the conditioning portion of an exercise session (

ACSM, 2014

). The warm-up should gradually increase in intensity until the desired intensity of training is reached. For many activities the warm-up period simply continues into the aerobic portion of the exercise session. For example, if an individual is going for a noontime run and wants to run at an 8 min·mi
−1
 pace, he or she may begin with a slow jog for the first few minutes (say a 10 min·mi
−1
 pace), increase to a faster pace (say a 9 min·mi
−1
 pace), and then proceed into the desired pace (the 8 min·mi
−1
 pace).




A warm-up period has the following beneficial effects on cardiovascular function.







It increases blood flow to the active skeletal muscles.






It increases blood flow to the myocardium.






It increases the dissociation of oxyhemoglobin.






It causes sweating, which plays a role in temperature regulation.






It may reduce the incidence of abnormal rhythms in the heart’s conduction system (dysrhythmias), which can lead to abnormal heart function (Barnard et al., 1973
).






A cooldown period of 5–10 minutes of light- to moderate-intensity activity should follow the conditioning period of the exercise session (ACSM, 2014
). The cooldown period prevents venous pooling by keeping the muscle pump active and thus may reduce the risk of postexercise hypotension (and possible fainting) and dysrhythmias. A cooldown also facilitates heat dissipation and promotes a more rapid removal of lactic acid/lactate and catecholamines from the blood.






FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Manipulation of Training Overload in a Taper






Peaking for performance often involves manipulating the training principles of specificity, overload, and maintenance within a periodization plan. This is exemplified by a study in which 18 male and 6 female distance runners were pretested, matched, and then divided into three groups. The run taper group systematically reduced its weekly training volume to 15% of their previous training volume over a 7-day period, performing 30% of the calculated reduced training distance on day 1, and then 20, 15, 12, 10, 8, and 5% on each succeeding day. Training consisted of 400-m intervals at close to 5-km pace (~100% 

peak) resulting in an HR of 170–190 b·min−1
 with recovery to 100–110 b·min−1
 before the next interval. The cycle taper group performed approximately the same number of intervals for the same duration as paired athletes in the run taper group, at the same work and recovery heart rates. The control group continued normal training, of which 6–10% of the weekly training distance was interval/fartlek work. All subjects participated in a 10-minute submaximal treadmill run, an incremental treadmill test to volitional fatigue in which the grade remained constant at 0% and the speed increased, and a 5-km time trial on the treadmill.







At the same absolute speed during the submaximal run, the run taper group (and seven of the eight individual runners) exhibited a 5% reduction (2.4 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) in oxygen consumption and a decrease of 7% (0.9 kcal·min
−1
) in calculated energy expenditure. No changes were evident in either the cycle taper or control group. Both maximal treadmill speed (2%) and total exercise time (4%) increased for the run taper group without a concomitant increase in
 

 or HRmax. No changes occurred in any maximal value for the cycle taper or control groups. The run taper group (all eight individuals) significantly improved 5-km performance by a mean of 2.8 ± 0.4%, or an average of almost 30 seconds. No improvement in performance was seen in either the cycle taper or control groups.








These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of a 7-day taper in which intensity is maintained, training volume drastically reduced, and specificity of training utilized. Of the variables measured, the most likely explanation for the improved 5-km performance was the increase in submaximal running economy (decreased submaximal oxygen and energy cost). Note, however, that all three groups maintained their
 

 values. This cross-training benefit exhibited by the cycle taper group is particularly important. Distance runners often have nagging injuries. These results imply that a non–weight-bearing taper may be used in such cases and allow the runner to possibly heal (or at least not aggravate an injury) while maintaining cardiovascular fitness. Performance enhancement, however, appears to require mode specificity during the taper.

Training Principles and Physical Activity Recommendations





Much evidence has been compiled that demonstrates the health-related benefits of moderate physical activity, including reduced incidence of cardiac events, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, depression, and anxiety. This evidence summarized in The Surgeon General’s Report (SGR) on Physical Activity and Health recommendation (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHH], 1996
) has been updated in the ACSM position stand (2011). The SGR was an important public health statement that recognized the health benefits associated with moderate levels of physical activity and encouraged increased activity among Americans by widely publicizing those health benefits and recommending levels of activity (an accumulation of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week) that were intended to be nonintimidating for currently sedentary individuals. Both joint statements by the American Heart Association (AHA) and ACSM (Haskell et al., 2007
; Nelson et al., 2007
) and the “2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans” (USDHH, 2008
) clarified that moderate activity should be done 5 days a week or vigorous activity 3 d·wk−1
 instead of the generic “on most days” for moderate activity. Such moderate- and vigorous-intensity activities were to be in addition to routine activities of daily living, which are of light intensity such as casual walking or grocery shopping. However, moderate or vigorous activities performed as part of daily life such as brisk walking to work or other manual labor performed in bouts of 10 minutes or more could be counted toward the time recommendation. In addition, the dose-response relationship between physical activity and health benefit was now emphasized. This continues to be the case. That is, while some activity of moderate intensity is better than no activity, more activity and more vigorous activity is better than less activity, within reasonable limits. All of these previous recommendations for adults have been incorporated into the current ACSM guidelines (2011) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines (2008) as shown in Table 13.1
. Canadian guidelines for adults (Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology [CSEP], 2011
) are similar but stated in terms of time (150 min·wk−1
) indicating that it is unclear which frequency of activity is best for maximal benefit. The 150 minutes is exclusive of any neuromuscular training (Tremblay et al., 2011
).




Table 13.1

 also contains two sets of recommendations for physical activity for children and

 adolescents (CSEP;
 
SHAPE America, 2015

). Evidence has indicated that 30 min·d
−1
 is not sufficient exercise for school-age individuals. This is reflected in the recommendations of 60+ min·d
−1
 of moderate to vigorous physical activity (

CSEP, 2011

;
 
SHAPE America, 2015

) for this age group. CSEP specifies that children/adolescents should participate in vigorous-intensity activity at least 3 d·wk
−1
. The 60-minute recommendation is inclusive of both the aerobic activity and the bone/muscle strengthening activity.




As with adults, children/adolescents can accumulate the recommended duration of activity throughout the day rather than in a single more structured training session. Children by nature tend to be sporadic exercisers, and getting them to exercise continuously is both unrealistic and unnecessary (

Corbin et al., 2004

). However, the SHAPE America guidelines do recommend that children should participate in several bouts of physical activity each day each lasting 15 minutes or more. Note that the 60-minute recommendation for those between 5 and 18 years of age is considered a minimum. Also, SHAPE America and CSEP recommend that extended periods of inactivity (2 or more hours at one time) be discouraged for children during waking hours. This includes screen time, motorized transport, extended sitting, and nonactive indoor time.




In contrast to the more formal exercise prescription recommendations of a frequency of 3–5 d·wk
−1
 for adults (to allow for the necessary rest and recovery to achieve adaptation to high-intensity exertion) the physical activity recommendations for children call for daily participation. This is actually easier for many youngsters because then activity behavior becomes a habit. Of course, older adolescents involved in specific sport training may modify this guideline according to their increased training needs. Unfortunately for nonathletes, a decline in physical activity commonly occurs through adolescence (

Strong et al., 2005

).




With few exceptions, children and adolescents ideally should be involved in a wide variety of age-appropriate activities. As with adults, large muscle activities involving rhythmical dynamic muscle contractions are best for the development of cardiovascular fitness, but children and adolescents should try as many different activities as possible to develop their skills and learn which they enjoy most. Enjoyable activities are more likely to be continued throughout life.




All guidelines presented in
 
Table 13.1

 are intended for “apparently healthy” individuals of the appropriate age irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Additionally, with appropriate evaluation, medical advisement, and initial modification to gradually progress to achieving the recommendations, they may be used for individuals with certain chronic diseases or disabilities.




Physical activity recommendations are the manifestation of the cardiorespiratory training principles for public health. In addition to documented health benefits, moderate-intensity physical activity was and is promoted as a way to increase the palatability of exercise so that more people would participate. Unfortunately, there is still a large segment of the adult US population who report no leisure-time physical activity (

Figure 13.5

). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) periodically polls the US population on a variety of issues. Their

 latest published results indicate that the proportion of the population reporting no physical activity has decreased from about 31% in 1989 to about 24% in 2014 (

CDC, 2016

). While this improvement is obviously a good thing, it does not mean that the remaining 73% are meeting the recommended levels. Data from 2013 indicated that 50% of adults participated in at least minimal recommended levels of physical activity (

CDC, 2015

). For high school students, only 27% achieved the recommended levels of physical activity (

CDC, 2015

). There is much room for improvement.

Cardiovascular Adaptations to Aerobic Endurance Training




As has been discussed, regular physical activity results in improvements in cardiovascular health and function. Although the primary goal and most obvious adaptation is an increase in 

, this adaptation is supported and accompanied by changes in numerous other physiological variables. The magnitude of the improvement depends on the training program—specifically on the frequency, intensity, and duration of the exercise and the individual’s initial level of fitness. Figure 13.6
 provides a schematic of the cardiovascular system and notes locations/sites where important adaptations occur. The numbering on the schematic coincides with the paragraphs below that detail cardiovascular adaptations. Note that adaptations occur throughout the cardiovascular system, including cardiac changes, vascular changes, and blood/coagulatory changes. Figure 13.7
 presents cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise to maximum following aerobic exercise training. Changes in cardiovascular variables may be evident at rest, during submaximal exercise, and during maximal exercise. Many of these changes have health implications.

Cardiac Structure (1)


In 1975, Morganroth conducted a groundbreaking study that used cardiac ultrasound to measure left ventricular changes in endurance athletes and sedentary controls. The findings of that study led to the concept of the “athlete’s heart,” which posits that the heart adapts to the specific demands of a training program. Exercise training programs bring about significant changes in myocardial structure and function known as exercise-induced cardiac remodeling (Weiner and Baggish, 2012
). Most studies have found that cardiac dimensions and mass increase with endurance training (Huston et al., 1985
; Keul et al., 1981
; Longhurst et al., 1981
; Morganroth et al., 1975
; Spence et al., 2011
). These changes are associated with high cardiac output during sustained aerobic exercise. Endurance training exposes the heart to conditions of increased ventricular filling, with subsequent high stroke volume and cardiac output. This chronic exposure to high levels of ventricular filling (large end-diastolic volume)
 is known as volume overload (Morganroth et al., 1975
). Chronic volume overload results in an increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (Huston et al., 1985
; Keul et al., 1981
) and left ventricular mass (Cohen and Segal, 1985
; Longhurst et al., 1981
). To better characterize the effect of aerobic training on both left and right ventricular mass and volume, Scharhag et al. (2002)
 used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure heart size and volume in a group of endurance-trained male athletes and a group of age- and size-matched controls. As shown in Figure 13.8
, the aerobically trained athletes had greater right and left ventricular mass (Figure 13.8A
) and greater right and left end-diastolic volume (Figure 13.8B
). A more recent study that used MRI to investigate cardiac adaptations following a 6-month endurance training program found a significant increase in left ventricular mass but no significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (Spence et al., 2011
).

) and End-Diastolic Ventricular Volumes (B

Cardiac Function (2)


There are several measures of cardiac function that changes as a result of aerobic exercise training.


Cardiac Output (2a)


Cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute, is also the amount of blood that flows through the vascular system each minute. As seen
 in Figure 13.7A
, cardiac output is unchanged at rest and during submaximal exercise following an aerobic exercise training program. However, following a training program, more work can be done, meaning that the exercise test to maximum can continue longer, and a higher maximal cardiac output can be achieved.



Although resting cardiac output does not change following a training program, it is achieved by a larger stroke volume and a lower heart rate than in the untrained (

Saltin, 1969

). Cardiac output at an absolute submaximal workload is decreased or unchanged with training, but, as at rest, the relative contribution of stroke volume and heart rate is changed (

Åstrand and Rodahl, 1986

;
 
Mitchell and Raven, 1994

). Maximal cardiac output increases at maximal levels of exercise following an endurance exercise training program (

Figure 13.7A

). This increase results from an increase in stroke volume, since maximal heart rate does not change to a degree that has any physiological meaning with training. The magnitude of the increase in cardiac output depends on the level of training. Elite endurance athletes may have cardiac output values in excess of 35 L·min
−1
.



Stroke Volume (2b)


Changes in stroke volume represent one of the most fundamental adaptations to endurance training. As shown in Figure 13.7B
, endurance training results in an increased stroke volume at rest, during submaximal exercise, and during maximal exercise. This increase results from increased plasma volume, increased cardiac dimensions, increased venous return, and an enhanced ability of the ventricle to stretch and accommodate increased venous return (Mitchell and Raven, 1994
; Smith and Mitchell, 1993
). Since several of these are structural changes, they exert their influence both at rest and during exercise.



It has traditionally been reported that the pattern of stroke volume response during incremental work to maximum is best described as an initial rectilinear rise that plateaus at about 40–50% of
 

. This is seen in
 
Figure 13.7B

. However, as shown in
 
Figure 13.9

, some evidence suggests that stroke volume does not plateau in highly trained endurance athletes (

Gledhill et al., 1994

;
 
Wiebe et al., 1999

), although most studies suggest that it does in untrained individuals (

Figures 13.7B

 and
 
13.9

). The question of whether endurance-trained athletes have a qualitatively different stroke volume response to incremental exercise remains unanswered (

Rowland, 2009a

).

Heart Rate (2c)


Resting heart rate is lower following endurance training (Figure 13.7C
). Although bradycardia is technically defined as a resting heart rate less than 60 b·min−1
, the term is sometimes used to refer to the lower resting heart rate resulting from exercise training. Bradycardia is one of the classic and most easily assessed indicators of training adaptation. A reduced heart rate reflects a more efficient heart as the same amount of blood can be pumped each minute (cardiac output) with fewer beats. Fewer heart beats are needed to achieve the same cardiac output because stroke volume is increased following training. The heart rate response to an absolute submaximal amount of work is significantly reduced following endurance training. Maximal
 heart rate is unchanged or slightly decreased (2–3 b·min−1
) with endurance training (Ekblom et al., 1968
; Saltin, 1969
).


Maximal Oxygen Consumption (2d)


Maximal oxygen consumption (

) is an integrated measure of cardiovascular function, and increases in 

 are one of the primary measures of cardiovascular health. Maximal oxygen consumption (

) increases as a result of endurance training (Figure 13.7D
). The magnitude of the increase depends on the type of training program. Improvements of 5–30% are commonly reported, with improvements of 15% routinely found for training programs that meet the recommendations of the ACSM (1998
). 

 rapidly improves during the first 2 months of an endurance training program. Then improvements continue to occur, but at a slower rate. This pattern appears to be independent of sex and is consistent over a wide age range, although older individuals may take longer to adapt to endurance training (ACSM, 1998
; Cunningham and Hill, 1975
; Seals et al., 1984
).



The improvement in
 

 results from central and peripheral cardiovascular adaptations. Recall that
 

 can be calculated as the product of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO
2
diff) (Equation 11.13). As previously discussed, maximal cardiac output increases as a result of endurance training, representing a central adaptation that supports the training-induced improvement in
 

. The a-vO
2
diff reflects oxygen extraction by the working tissue and thus represents a peripheral adaptation that supports the improvement in
 

 (see
 
Chapter 10

). Changes in cardiac output are a more consistent training adaptation than changes in a-vO
2
diff, and stroke volume appears to be the principal factor responsible for the increase in cardiac output.

 is related to the demands of the sport. Athletes whose performance depends on the ability of the cardiovascular system to sustain dynamic exercise consistently have higher
 

 values than athletes whose sport performance is based primarily on motor skills, such as baseball.

 that any individual can ultimately achieve. Thus, although all individuals can increase
 

 with training, an individual with a greater genetic potential is more likely to excel at sports that require a high
 

. Furthermore, individuals differ in their sensitivity to training, in part because of different genetic makeup (

Bouchard and Persusse, 1994

).

Vascular Structure (3)


As described in Chapter 11
, blood vessel walls contain a layer of smooth muscle, the tunica media. Blood flow to a given region is determined by the pressure gradient and the resistance (F = ∆P/R). By far, the greatest influence on resistance is the diameter of the vessel. Vessel diameter is determined by the actual size of the vessel and the relative degree of contraction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media. The greater the size of the vessel or the greater its ability to dilate, the greater the ability of the vasculature to provide increased blood flow to meet
 the needs of active tissue. Evidence shows that aerobic training can increase both the size of vessels and their ability to dilate.



Endurance training can lead to structural changes in the vasculature, including increased lumen size and decreased wall thickness, through the process of
 arterial remodeling
. Strong evidence suggests that endurance athletes have enlarged arteries, both pericardial and those supplying skeletal muscle, thus demonstrating that aerobic exercise leads to structural changes in arteries that increase resting lumen diameter (

Dinenno et al., 2001

;
 
Green et al., 2012

;
 
Prior et al., 2003

;
 
Schmidt-Trucksass et al., 2000

).
 
Naylor et al. (2006)

 reported that the resting brachial artery diameter of elite rowers was significantly greater than that of untrained volunteers. Spence and colleagues reported that 6 months of endurance training resulted in increased femoral artery diameter, but not brachial artery diameter (

Spence et al., 2013

). Certainly, an increased arterial diameter to working muscle represents a positive adaptation to exercise, but evidence also suggests that the coronary arteries, supplying blood to the working myocardium, are enlarged in highly trained athletes. Several studies (including the classic autopsy report of Clarence DeMar, winner of seven Boston marathons) have shown that habitual exercise is related to a larger cross-sectional arterial size. DeMar’s arteries were reportedly two to three times the normal size (

Currens and White, 1961

). Research studies consistently find that endurance athletes have larger arteries and many studies have reported a decreased wall thickness in trained athletes. These findings have led to the theory that there may be an “athlete’s artery” that is parallel to the “athlete’s heart” (

Green et al., 2012

).



Vascular Function (4)


Exercise training leads to an improved ability of arterial vessels to vasodilate; the increased vasodilatory potential is directly related to endothelium nitric oxide production. Thus, aerobic training improves endothelial function allowing the vessels to dilate and provide increased blood flow to working muscles. Improvements in endothelial function following aerobic exercise programs have been reported in healthy individuals with low risk for cardiac disease and in individuals with several risk factors as well as those with known cardiovascular disease (Green et al., 2003
; Hambrecht et al., 1998
; Niebauer and Cooke, 1996
). Increasing evidence from animal studies shows that aerobic exercise leads to increased vasodilatory potential at several sites along the vascular tree, including the aorta, coronary arteries, and the brachial and femoral arteries ( Jasperse and Laughlin, 2006
).



Coronary vessels apparently have an increased vasodilatory response to exercise following exercise training. In a study that compared ultramarathoners to sedentary individuals, investigators found no difference in the internal diameter of the coronary arteries in the two groups at rest, but the capacity of the coronary arteries to dilate was two times greater in the marathoners than in the sedentary individuals (13.2 mm
2
 vs. 6 mm
2
) (

Haskell et al., 1993

). The ability of arteries to dilate during exercise may be even more important than the resting diameter, because the myocardial demand for oxygen is low during rest and high during exercise, as evidenced by the low rate-pressure product (RPP) at rest and the high RPP during exercise.




It is not yet possible to definitively describe the effect of aerobic training on endothelial function because the adaptation appears to depend on several factors, including the exercise stimulus, the species studied, the vessel size, the organ supplied, and the health status.



Hemodynamics (5)


Aerobic training affects multiple hemodynamic variables that are associated with blood flow through the vascular system.


Blood Pressure (5a)


As indicated in Figure 13.7E
 and as most studies report, there is little or no change in arterial blood pressure (SBP, DBP, MAP) at rest, during submaximal exercise, or during maximal exercise in normotensive individuals after an endurance training program (Seals et al., 1984
). However, because the maximal amount of work that can be done increases with exercise training, a trained individual is capable of doing more work. Thus, maximal systolic blood pressure may be higher for trained individuals at maximal exercise. This difference is usually small between sedentary and normally fit individuals.


Total Peripheral Resistance (5b)


Resistance is unchanged at rest or during an absolute submaximal workload following a training program (Figure 13.7F
). However, total peripheral resistance is lower at maximal exercise following training. For this reason, trained individuals can generate significantly higher cardiac outputs at similar arterial pressures during maximal exercise. Much of the additional decrease in the total peripheral resistance at maximal exercise in trained individuals results from the increased capillarization of the skeletal muscle in these individuals (Blomqvist and Saltin, 1983
).


Rate-Pressure Product (5c)


Rate-pressure product reflects the work of the heart. It is the product of HR and SBP, and thus adaptations in RPP could logically be described under both cardiac and vascular adaptations.



Myocardial oxygen consumption, indicated by the rate-pressure product, is lower at rest and during submaximal exercise following endurance training (

Figure 13.7G

).

 This result reflects the greater efficiency of the heart, since fewer contractions are necessary to eject the same amount of blood during submaximal exercise (

Mitchell and Raven, 1994

). Because maximal heart rate is unchanged and systolic blood pressure is either unchanged or increases slightly with exercise training, it follows that the maximal rate-pressure product is unchanged or increases slightly.



Blood Volume (6)


Blood volume increases as a result of endurance training. Highly trained endurance athletes have a 20–25% larger blood volume than untrained subjects. The increase in blood volume is primarily due to an expansion of plasma volume. This increase has been reported for both males and females and appears to be independent of age (Convertino, 1991
). Increases in plasma volume occur soon after beginning an endurance training program, with changes between 8% and 10% occurring within the first week of training (Convertino et al., 1980
) followed by a plateauing of plasma volume. For up to 10 days of training, an expansion of plasma volume accounts for increases in blood volume, with little or no change in red blood cell mass (Convertino, 1991
; Convertino et al., 1980
).



Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations during this period are often lower, because the red blood cells and hemoglobin are diluted by the larger plasma volume. This condition has sometimes been called
 sports anemia,
 but this term is a misnomer because the number of red blood cells is almost the same or may actually be increased above pretraining levels. Thus, there is no reason for alarm about this condition; in fact, it may actually be beneficial. The lower hematocrit as a result of elevated plasma volume and normal or slightly elevated number of red blood cells means that the blood is less viscous, which decreases resistance to flow and facilitates the transportation of oxygen.




After approximately 1 month of training, the increase in blood volume is distributed more equally between increases in plasma volume and red blood cell mass (

Convertino, 1991

;
 
Convertino et al., 1991

). Blood volume and plasma volume return to pretraining levels when exercise is discontinued.
 
Figure 13.11

 depicts these changes in blood volume, plasma volume, and red blood cell volume during 8 days of exercise training and after 7 days of cessation of exercise.

Clot Formation and Breakdown (7)


As discussed in Chapter 11
, a blood clot forms when needed to prevent blood loss from a damaged vessel. The body also breaks down clots (fibrinolysis) when they are no longer needed. Although blood clots are very useful when a vessel is damaged, unnecessary clots greatly increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.



Aerobic exercise training decreases the blood’s tendency to clot and enhances the process of dissolving unnecessary clots (enhanced fibrinolytic activity), thus decreasing the risk for vascular clot formation. These are important mechanisms by which regular exercise decreases the risk of cardiovascular death. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise alters coagulatory potential in part by depressing platelet aggregation (first step in clot formation) in healthy men and women (

Wang et al., 1995

,
 
1997

). Since the endothelium releases factors that inhibit platelet aggregation, improved endothelial function with exercise may be related to the beneficial

 changes observed in platelets following a training program. In addition to suppressing platelet aggregation, some inconclusive evidence suggests that moderate levels of aerobic training decrease coagulatory potential in healthy adults, as evidenced by a decrease in clotting factors (

Womack et al., 2003

). While evidence shows that moderate exercise training decreases clotting potential, thus decreasing the risk of coronary thrombus formation, evidence also shows that the ability to break down clots is enhanced following a moderate training program (

Womack et al., 2003

). Furthermore, it has been reported that fibrinolytic activity is greater after exercise in active individuals than in sedentary individuals (

Szymanski and Pate, 1994

).





Table 13.6

 summarizes the training adaptations that occur within the cardiovascular system as a result of a dynamic aerobic exercise program.




TABLE 13.6
 Cardiovascular Adaptations to Dynamic Aerobic Exercise








Cardiovascular Adaptations to Dynamic Resistance Training




Low-volume dynamic resistance training (few repetitions and low weight) has not been shown to lead to any consistent or significant changes in cardiovascular variables. Thus, the changes described in the following sections depend on high-volume (high total workload) dynamic resistance training programs (Stone et al., 1991
).


Cardiac Structure


Dynamic resistance–trained athletes often have increased left ventricular wall and septal thicknesses, although this is not consistently seen in short-term training studies (Keul et al., 1981
; Longhurst et al., 1981
; Morganroth et al., 1975
; Pluim et al., 2000
; Spence et al., 2011
). When the increase in wall thickness is reported relative to body surface area or lean body mass, the increase is greatly reduced or even nonexistent (Fleck, 1988a
). The increase in wall thickness is thought to result from the work the heart must do to overcome the high arterial pressures (increased pressure afterload) encountered during resistance training (Morganroth et al., 1975
); this depends on training intensity and volume.

Benefits of Lifestyle versus Structured Exercise Training






Preprofessional students involved in athletics or high-intensity personal exercise training programs often find it difficult to accept that the level of activity recommended in the Surgeon General’s Report (30 min day−1
, most days) can have any meaningful impact on measures of cardiorespiratory fitness or physiological variables. A study conducted at the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research (and reported in these two articles) provides evidence for the effectiveness of this approach. Subjects were randomized into either a structured intervention program or lifestyle activity intervention program. Individuals in the structured group were given free memberships to the Cooper Fitness Center and trained with a designated exercise leader. Their program began with 30 minutes of walking 3 d·wk−1
, but after 3 weeks, they were allowed to select any available aerobic program and eventually progressed to 5 d·wk−1
. The lifestyle group received curricular material at weekly meetings centered around individual motivational readiness and behavioral motivation techniques. They were asked to accumulate no fewer than 30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity activity most days in any way that could be adapted to their individual lifestyle and to progress at their own rate. After 6 months, both groups were put on maintenance programs, during which they were requested simply to continue their respective activities. Direct leadership and the number of group meetings were reduced. Selected cardiovascular results are presented in the accompanying table.







As anticipated, the greatest changes were made in the initial 6 months in both groups. Both interventions were effective in increasing physical activity, as indicated by the increases in energy expenditure and walking and the decreases in sitting. However, the structured group increased hard activity more than the lifestyle group and hence improved more than the lifestyle group in physical fitness. The improvement was measured by a greater decrease in HR during submaximal treadmill walking and a greater increase in
 

peak. In the ensuing 18 months, both groups decreased physical activity (energy expenditure) and physical fitness (


peak) from the 6-month level but maintained significant improvements over their initial values. Although the absolute magnitude of the changes is not great, it is important to realize that during the first 6 months, only 32 and 27% of the lifestyle and structure groups attained the level of activity suggested by the Surgeon General’s Report. During the maintenance phase, these numbers were reduced to 20% in each group. Those in both groups who reported that they were active 70% or more of the weeks had at least twice as much improvement as those who did not.








The “take-home” messages from this study are that even under the conditions of well-designed and well-delivered external intervention, getting all individuals to include minimal but meaningful levels of activity into their lives is difficult. However, in previously sedentary healthy adult males and females, lifestyle intervention can be as effective as a structured exercise program in improving physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness.

Stroke Volume and Heart Rate


Resting stroke volume in highly trained dynamic resistance athletes has been reported to be both greater than normal and not different from normal (Effron, 1989
; Fleck, 1988b
). Because stroke volume is so seldom measured during resistance activities, changes that may occur in stroke volume from this type of training are not known (Sjogaard et al., 1988
).



Highly trained dynamic resistance athletes have average or below-average resting heart rates (

Stone et al., 1991

). Heart rate at a specified submaximal dynamic resistance workload is lower following resistance training (

Fleck and Dean, 1987

).

Resistance Training Improves Vascular Function in Overweight Women






Aerobic exercise is known to improve endothelial function. Aerobic exercise significantly elevates blood flow under moderately high pressure for a prolonged period of time. This increase in shear stress on the endothelium is thought to increase nitric oxide production leading to enhanced vasodilation. A recent study, however, hypothesized that resistance training, which elevates blood flow for shorter periods but under higher pressure, would also provide a stress stimulus on the endothelium resulting in improved vascular function.







The study included 30 overweight women, 15 of whom engaged in a 1-year resistance training program and 15 who served as controls. The researchers measured the resting diameter of the brachial artery before and after training. They also measured the artery’s ability to vasodilate after 3 minutes of occlusion, which is known to cause an increase in blood flow; this phenomenon is known as reactive hyperemia. The brachial diameter during the reactive hyperemia was reported as peak flow-mediated dilation and expressed as a percent.








This study found that resistance training positively affects vascular function in overweight women. This finding suggests that resistance training has important cardiovascular benefits and provides further support for the recommendation of including resistance training in an overall fitness program. However, given the small sample size and the narrow population studied, additional research into the effects of resistance training on vascular structure and function is warranted.

Blood Pressure


Dynamic resistance–trained athletes do not have elevated resting blood pressures, provided that they are not chronically overtrained, do not have greatly increased muscle mass, and are not using anabolic steroids. This information contradicts the popular misconception that resistance-trained individuals have a higher resting blood pressure than endurance-trained or untrained individuals. Indeed, most scientific investigations report that highly trained resistance athletes have average or lower-than-average systolic and diastolic blood pressures (Fleck, 1988b
). Resistance-trained individuals also exhibit a lower blood pressure response to the same relative workload of resistance exercise than untrained individuals, even though the trained individuals are lifting a greater absolute load.



Dynamic resistance training has not been shown to consistently lower blood pressure in hypertensive individuals and therefore is not recommended as the only exercise modality for hypertensives except in the form of circuit training. Circuit training relies on high repetitions, low loads, and short rest periods in a series of stations. A supercircuit integrates aerobic endurance activities between the stations

.




The rate-pressure product, which reflects myocardial oxygen consumption, is decreased at rest following strength training, during weight lifting or circuit training, and during aerobic exercise that includes a resistance component (such as holding hand weights while walking) (

Fleck, 1988b

;
 
Stone et al., 1991

). Researchers have suggested that these results occur because of a reduction in peripheral resistance.



Maximal Oxygen Consumption


Small increases (4–9%) in 

 have been reported following circuit training and Olympic-style weight-lifting programs (Gettman, 1981
; Stone et al., 1991
). However, other studies have failed to identify any increase in 

 with resistance training (Hurley et al., 1984
). 

 probably does not change much because of the
 low percentage of 

 achieved during resistance training. Weight training may impact the central cardiovascular variables as described earlier (i.e., resulting in a reduced resting heart rate), but it does not enhance peripheral cardiovascular adaptations (i.e., a-vO2
diff). Thus, to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, individuals should not rely on resistance training programs but instead use dynamic resistance training in conjunction with aerobic endurance training.




The Influence of Age and Sex on Cardiovascular Training Adaptations




Few data are available regarding the influence of age and sex on cardiovascular adaptations to dynamic resistance exercise. Therefore, this section addresses only cardiovascular adaptations to aerobic endurance exercise.


Male-Female Differences in Adaptations


Research evidence suggests no differences between the sexes in central or peripheral adaptations to aerobic endurance training. Both sexes exhibit similar cardiovascular adaptations at rest, during submaximal exercise, and at maximal exercise (Drinkwater, 1984
; Mitchell et al., 1992
). Maximal cardiac output is higher in both sexes because of the increased stroke volume following training; however, the absolute value achieved by a woman is less than that attained by a similarly trained man.



When males and females of similar fitness level train at the same frequency, intensity, and duration, they show no differences in the relative increase in
 

 (

Lewis et al., 1986

;
 
Mitchell et al., 1992

). As shown earlier in
 
Figure 12.20

,
 

 overlaps considerably between the sexes. Thus, a well-trained female may have a higher
 

 than a sedentary or even normally active male; however, a female will always have a lower
 

 than a similarly trained and similarly genetically endowed male.




The blood pressure (SBP, DBP, MAP) response to exercise is unchanged in both sexes

 following endurance training. Males and females show the same adaptations in total peripheral resistance and rate-pressure product. The effects of endurance training on cardiovascular variables at maximal exercise are reported in
 
Table 13.7

 for both sexes. In summary, the trainability of females does not differ from that of males, and similar benefits can and should be gained from regular activity by both sexes (

Hanson and Nedde, 1974

). However, the absolute values achieved for maximal oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and stroke volume are generally lower in females because of their smaller body and heart size.




TABLE 13.7
 Comparison of Cardiovascular Responses to Maximal Exercise in Sedentary and Trained Young Adults (20–30 y)






Adaptations in Children and Adolescents


Endurance training has been documented to result in increased left ventricular mass and heart volume in children, as it does in adults (Bar-Or, 1983
; Greenen et al., 1982
). The increase in heart size is associated with an increased resting stroke volume (Gutin et al., 1988
) and a decreased resting heart rate but not with any change in cardiac output (Eriksson and Koch, 1973
). Research also suggests an increased blood volume and hemoglobin level in young endurance athletes compared with sedentary children (Eriksson and Koch, 1973
; Koch and Rocher, 1980
; Zauner et al., 1989
), but possibly not as much as in adults. Information about changes in capillary density with training in children is not available (Rowland, 2005
).



At submaximal levels of exercise, cardiac output is unchanged or slightly decreased in youngsters after endurance training (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Soto et al., 1983

) as a result of increased submaximal stroke volume and decreased heart rate (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Lussier and Buskirk, 1977

). Neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure changes significantly as a result of endurance training during submaximal work (

Lussier and Buskirk, 1977

).




At maximal work, cardiac output increases in children and adolescents as a result of endurance training. This is caused by an increased maximal stroke volume and stable maximal heart rate (

Eriksson and Koch, 1973

;
 
Lussier and Buskirk, 1977

).




Children and adolescents can participate in a wide variety of training programs in school or community settings (

Figure 13.12

). Research has consistently shown improvements in endurance performance as a result of exercise training. Such improvements have occurred when

 endurance performance was measured as an increase in the workload performed (longer treadmill times or distances run, more distance covered in a set time, higher work output on a cycle ergometer, or longer rides at the same load) or as a faster time for a given distance (

Cooper et al., 1975

;
 
Daniels and Oldridge, 1971

;
 
Daniels et al., 1978

;
 
Duncan et al., 1983

;
 
Dwyer et al., 1983

;
 
Goode et al., 1976

;
 
Graunke et al., 1990

;
 
Mosellin and Wasmund, 1973

;
 
Siegel and Manfredi, 1984

). Given the lack of association between endurance performance and
 

 in children, it is not surprising that endurance performance improvements are not always accompanied by a comparable improvement in
 

 (

Daniels and Oldridge, 1971

;
 
Daniels et al., 1978

). Although children and adolescents who participate in organized athletic activities have higher
 

 values than those who do not, the relationship between measures of physical activity (such as self-report questionnaires, heart rate monitoring, and motion detection devices) and measures of
 

 is generally only low to moderate (

Morrow and Freedson, 1994

;
 
Rowland, 2005

;
 
Vaccaro and Mahon, 1987

). The most consistent finding of cardiovascular adaptations in prepubertal children is a diminished level of aerobic trainability compared to adults (

Rowland, 2005

). This occurs even in those studies in which the training meets the standards of intensity, duration, and frequency that result in substantial improvements in adults. Thus, where an adult (or postpubertal adolescent) might show a 25–30% increase, this is more likely to be 10–15% in prepubertal children. It has been suggested (

Rowland, 2009b

) that this difference may be the result of metabolic differences between children and adults (as discussed in
 
Chapter 5

). Clarification requires further research.

Adaptations in Older Adults


Older men and women respond to endurance exercise training with adaptations similar to those in younger adults (Hagberg et al., 1989
; Heath et al., 1981
; Ogawa et al., 1992
). Left ventricular wall thickness and myocardial mass are greater in elderly athletes than in elderly sedentary individuals, although these training adaptations may not be as pronounced or as quickly achieved as in younger adults (Green and Crouse, 1993
; Heath et al., 1981
; Ogawa et al., 1992
).



Left ventricular end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction increase as a result of endurance training in older individuals. These changes enhance myocardial contractile function, especially the Frank-Starling mechanism, and help maintain cardiac output in the active elderly (

Green and Crouse, 1993

).




Resting cardiac output is unchanged as a result of endurance training in the elderly. Elderly athletes with an extensive history of endurance training consistently show lower resting heart rates than sedentary older adults. However, short-term training programs sometimes cause the expected decrease in resting heart rates and sometimes do not. Resting stroke volume typically increases, but the increase is generally small (

Green and Crouse, 1993

).




As in normotensive individuals of other ages, endurance training does not affect systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or mean arterial blood pressure at rest in elderly people. Both hemoglobin levels and blood volume increase in the elderly as a result of endurance training, as does the density of capillaries supplying blood to the active musculature (

Green and Crouse, 1993

).




Most training studies show no change in cardiac output during any given submaximal workload. The components of cardiac output, however, often change reciprocally, with the expected decrease in heart rate and increase in stroke volume. Again, the stroke volume changes tend to be small and do not always reach statistical significance. Submaximal values for systolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, and total peripheral resistance are lower in elderly athletes than in nonathletes and decrease with endurance training (

Green and Crouse, 1993

).




Maximal cardiac output may be increased by exercise training in older individuals. This increase is completely accounted for by the increased maximal stroke volume, since maximal heart rate is unchanged. The reported effects of endurance training on blood pressures and systematic vascular resistance are inconsistent, although most evidence suggests no change in these variables (

Green and Crouse, 1993

).




The results of training status on cardiovascular responses to maximal exercise in the elderly, including
 

, are shown in
 
Table 13.8

 for both men and women.
 

 is higher in trained than in untrained elderly. Thus, training programs can result in increases in
 

 in the elderly. The magnitude of this increase depends on the individual’s initial fitness level and the training program. Research suggests, however, that healthy, older untrained males and females can improve their
 

 by 15–30% with training (

Hagberg et al., 1989

;
 
Ogawa et al., 1992

;
 
Seals et al., 1984

).




TABLE 13.8
 Comparison of Cardiovascular Responses to Maximal Exercise in Sedentary and Trained Elderly Individuals (60–70 y)







One study using a short-duration exercise program (9 weeks) of endurance training reported that a low-intensity exercise prescription (30–45% HRR) was as effective as a high-intensity exercise prescription (60–75% HRR) in eliciting improvements in
 

 (

Badenhop et al., 1983

). However, a 1-year training program found that 6 months of training at low intensities (40% HRR) resulted in only a 10.5% improvement in
 

 in elderly subjects. When the training program was progressively changed to a high-intensity program (85% HRR) and the duration extended, their
 

 increased by another 16.5%. This research suggests that older individuals respond to exercise training in much the same way as younger individuals.




When starting a training program for older people, it is important to begin at low intensities to avoid injury. Significant improvements in function can be gained from low-intensity programs. After individuals become accustomed to the program, the training can be upgraded to a more intense level if desired. Note that the rate of adaptation may be slower in older individuals (

ACSM, 2014

)

.




Although older athletes are more similar to younger individuals than to their sedentary counterparts, and training programs tend to show the same beneficial changes in older as in younger subjects, exercise training does not stop the effects of aging on the cardiovascular system. At best, exercise training can only lessen normal age-related losses in cardiovascular function. This conclusion is exemplified in
 
Figure 13.13

, where the average rate of decline in
 

 is shown for both an active, highly fit (HF) group of females and a relatively sedentary, low fitness (LF) comparison group (

Plowman et al., 1979

). The first thing to notice is that the HF group had higher
 

 values than the LF group in every decade. Indeed, the
 

 values of active 45-year-olds equaled those of inactive 20-year-olds. Second,
 

 expressed per kilogram of body weight declined with age, and the rate of decline was similar in the two groups. More recent data suggest that the rate of decline in peak
 

 in healthy adults is not constant across the age span but accelerates markedly with each successive decade, regardless of physical activity habits (

Fleg et al., 2005

). It appears that declining forced expiratory volume (FEV
1
) and maximal exercise heart rates account for much of the “aging effect” on aerobic capacity (

Hollenberg et al., 2006

). The decline of peak aerobic capacity has substantial implications with regard to functional independence and quality of life for older adults.

Detraining in the Cardiorespiratory System




It is clear that athletes and physically active individuals enjoy fitness and health benefits from the physiological adaptations resulting from their lifestyle. It is also clear, as expressed in the reversibility training principle, that individuals lose the benefits of physical activity when they cease being active or detrain.



The consequences of detraining depend on many factors, including the individual’s training status and the extent of the inactivity (decreased or ceased completely). The extent of these physiological reversals also depends on how long detraining continues. Further complicating the impact of detraining is normal aging. In fact, it is often not possible to distinguish between the effects of aging and detraining in an older population.




All available research evidence suggests that all physiological variables that are responsive to exercise training also respond to detraining, and adaptations in the cardiovascular system are no exception. In general, detraining leads to lower maximal oxygen consumption (


). Brief periods of detraining (10–14 days) appear not to result in a decrease in
 

 in highly trained individuals (

Cullinane et al., 1986

;
 
Houston et al., 1979

). On the other hand, a training cessation of 2–4 weeks results

 in decreases in
 

 of approximately 4–15% (

Coyle et al., 1984

,
 
1986

;
 
Mujika and Padilla, 2000

). This reduction is greater in highly trained than in recently trained individuals (

Mujika and Padilla, 2000

). In 1993, a study by Madsen et al. in which exercise training was severely reduced in highly trained athletes reported that
 

 was maintained during the 4 weeks of detraining (

Madsen et al., 1993

). This finding can be attributed to the fact that in the Madsen study, athletes severely reduced their training but did not cease to train (the athletes performed one 35-minute bout of intense training rather than their normal training of 6–10 hours a week). Improvements in
 

 and changes in cardiac structure that were documented with 6 months of endurance training were lost with 6 weeks of detraining (

Spence et al., 2011

).





Figure 13.14

 presents changes in
 

 over an 84-day period in a group of endurance-trained subjects (

Coyle et al., 1984

). These data suggest that in highly trained individuals,
 

 may decline as much as 20% with detraining but still remain above levels of sedentary individuals. Other studies report the complete reversal of
 

 to pretraining levels in individuals who are recently trained (

Mujika and Padilla, 2000

). Changes in
 

 during detraining are accompanied by reductions in maximal stroke volume and cardiac output and increased maximal heart rate (

Figure 13.14

). The decrease in stroke volume and thus cardiac output can most likely be attributed to changes in blood volume. Detraining leads to 5–10% decreases in blood volume, and these reductions may occur within 2 days of inactivity (

Cullinane et al., 1986

;
 
Mujika and Padilla, 2000

).
 
Coyle et al. (1986)

 investigated the effects of 2–4 weeks of inactivity on endurance-trained men and reported a 9% decline in blood volume and a 12% reduction in stroke volume. When blood volume was expanded (by infusing a dextran solution in saline) to a level equal to the trained state, both stroke volume and
 

 increased to within 2–4% of the trained state.

Collectively, these findings suggest that cardiovascular training adaptations are lost relatively quickly when training ceases.





SUMMARY





1.
 A cardiovascular training program depends on the individual’s age, health status, and the program’s goals.




2.
 Any activity involving large muscle groups for a prolonged time has the potential to increase cardiovascular fitness. The choice of exercise modalities should be based on interest, availability, and a low risk of injury.




3.
 Training using different exercise modalities causes the same overall benefits with central cardiovascular adaptations, but peripheral cardiovascular adaptations are specific to the muscles being exercised.




4.
 Intensity is very important for improving maximal oxygen consumption (


) primarily in conjunction with duration, which determines training volume.

 Intensity can be prescribed in relation to heart rate, oxygen consumption, or rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Training intensity is the most important factor for maintaining cardiovascular fitness.




5.
 The ACSM recommends the following training goals to develop and maintain cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy adults: frequency of 3–5 d·wk
−1
, intensity of 64–95% HRmax, 40–89%
 

R or %HRR, and duration of 20–60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity.




6.
 The Canadian Society for Exercise Science recommends a total of 150 min·wk
−1
 of moderate to vigorous physical activity at a frequency determined by the individual.




7.
 Children and adolescents should participate in at least 60 min·d
−1
 of moderate to vigorous physical activity that is age appropriate while minimizing sedentary activity the rest of the day.




8.
 The absolute and relative increases in
 

 and the health benefits thereof are inversely related to the individual’s initial fitness level. The greatest improvements in fitness and health occur when very sedentary individuals begin a regular, low-to-moderate endurance exercise program. Meaningful health benefits can be achieved with minimal increases in activity or fitness by those who need it most.




9.
 Endurance training results in increased cardiac dimensions and mass.




10.
 Cardiac output at rest and at an absolute submaximal workload is not changed by an endurance training program. However, cardiac output at the same relative workload and at maximal exercise is greater with endurance training.




11.
 Stroke volume is greater at rest, at submaximal exercise (absolute and relative workloads), and at maximal exercise with endurance training.




12.
 Heart rate is lower at rest and during an absolute submaximal workload with endurance training. It is unchanged at the same relative submaximal workload and at maximal exercise.




13.
 

 increases with endurance training; improvements of 15% are routinely reported with training programs that meet the recommendations of ACSM.




14.
 Endurance training leads to positive structural and functional adaptations in the vasculature because of vascular remodeling and improved endothelial function.




15.
 Blood pressure changes little or not at all at rest, during submaximal exercise, or during maximal exercise in normotensive individuals with endurance training.




16.
 Endurance training results in increased blood volume, with highly trained endurance athletes having 20–25% greater volume than untrained subjects. Changes in plasma volume occur early in a training program, with an 8–10% change occurring within the first week. Early changes (at 1 month) are due almost entirely to increases in plasma volume, whereas increases in red blood cells and hemoglobin occur later.




17.
 Endurance training results in changes in blood formation and clot breakdown that decrease the likelihood of unnecessary clot formation.





Review Questions









1.
  How is overload manipulated to bring about cardiorespiratory adaptation? Consider exercise recommendations for fitness and physical activity guidelines for health benefit in your response.




2.
  Differentiate between central and peripheral cardiovascular adaptations.




3.
  Compare and contrast adaptations in cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, and blood pressure with endurance training at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise.




4.
  Discuss the relevance of an individual’s initial fitness level for expected improvements in fitness and health-related benefits.




5.
  Describe the physiological benefits of a warm-up and a cooldown period.




6.
  Explain the changes in blood volume that result from endurance training.




7.
  Describe changes in cardiac dimensions that result from endurance training, and explain how these structural changes support improved cardiac function.




8.
  Describe changes in blood clotting and breakdown that result from endurance training, and explain how these physiological changes support improved cardiovascular health.




9.
  Compare and contrast cardiovascular adaptations to dynamic endurance and dynamic resistance training.
