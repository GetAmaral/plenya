Introduction





Many athletic competitions and recreational activities occur in settings in which hot or cold environmental conditions affect or may threaten physical performance, health, and even life. Thermoregulation
 is the process whereby body temperature is maintained or controlled under a wide range of such environmental conditions. In human beings, body temperature is maintained within a fairly narrow range by mechanisms that match heat production to heat loss. Human thermoregulatory responses rely heavily on the cardiovascular system to maintain body temperature. This chapter addresses issues related to exercise in environmental extremes, emphasizing the role of the cardiovascular system in mediating the body’s responses to exercise under such conditions.

Exercise in Environmental Extremes




Exercise in conditions of environmental extremes can present a serious challenge to the thermoregulatory and cardiovascular systems of the body. If the cardiovascular system cannot meet the concurrent demands of supplying adequate blood to the muscles and maintaining thermal balance in a hot environment, exertional heat illness (EHI)
 may ensue. Heat illness includes a spectrum of disorders from heat cramps to life-threatening heatstroke. Cold conditions can also pose problems. If an exerciser is unprepared or inadequately clothed for exercise in a cold environment, heat loss can exceed heat production, leading to cold-induced injury.



Exercise professionals have a responsibility to understand the problems associated with exercise in extreme environmental conditions because they may affect an individual’s performance or place an exerciser at risk for injury or even death. Understanding the body’s responses to extreme environmental conditions is necessary for minimizing performance decrements and avoiding injury or illness in those who train and compete in adverse conditions.





Basic Concepts




Understanding the body’s responses to exercise in different environments begins with basic environmental measures and the measurement of body temperature.


Measurement of Environmental Conditions


Human thermoregulation is affected by several environmental conditions, namely, ambient temperature (Tamb
), relative humidity, and wind speed. Ambient temperatures
 are often measured with a mercury or digital thermometer and can vary greatly in areas that are in shade or direct sunlight. Relative humidity
 is a measure of the moisture in the air relative to how much moisture, or water vapor, can be held by the air at a given ambient temperature. Thus, 70% humidity means that the air contains 70% of the moisture that it can hold at that temperature.



Specific scales are used to assess thermal heat load imposed by the environment. Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), developed by the military, is often used in industrial settings and athletic situations. The WBGT is calculated based on a formula that includes measures of air temperature, radiant heat load (measured by a thermometer in a small black globe that absorbs radiant heat), and relative humidity (measured by a thermometer covered with a wet cotton wick). Recommendations about the risk of heat stress at various WBGT levels are available in the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand on exertional heat illness (

ACSM, 2007a

). Included in this publication are guidelines for modifying or canceling high-intensity or long-duration exercise when WBGT conditions are a risk for adults and children. In many cases, however, WBGT measurements are not available, and a simpler measure of environmental heat stress—the heat index—can be used to assess the risk. The
 heat index
 is used to estimate the risk of heat stress based on the ambient temperature and relative humidity (

Figure 14.1

).

 Low risk: use discretion, especially if unconditioned or unacclimatized; little danger of heat stress for acclimatized individuals who hydrate adequately. Moderate risk: heat-sensitive and unacclimatized individuals may suffer; avoid strenuous activity in the sun; take adequate rest periods and replace fluids. High risk: extreme heat stress conditions exist; consider canceling all exercise. Source

Wind speed
 affects the amount of heat lost from the body and is used to calculate the windchill factor. Table 14.1
 presents the windchill chart adopted by the U.S. National Weather Service. This chart uses the wind velocity measured at a height of 1.3 m (5 ft). The windchill chart was developed as a public health tool to help prevent frostbite and cold-induced injuries by providing information for choosing appropriate clothing and activities based on available environmental data
.

Measurement of Body Temperature


Exercise physiologists differentiate among temperatures in different body sites; most commonly used are core temperature (Tco
) and skin temperature (Tsk
). Even this distinction is simplistic, however, because core and skin temperature both vary among different specific sites. Core temperature is normally maintained within fairly narrow limits of approximately 36.1–37.8°C (97–100°F) in the resting individual (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
). Skin temperature is considerably cooler, averaging approximately 33.3°C (91.4°F). Skin temperature is more variable than core temperature because it is greatly influenced by environmental conditions.



Body temperature is commonly measured with a thermometer placed in the mouth. However, this method is affected by many factors, including breathing rate and recent fluid ingestion. Heavy breathing through the mouth and the ingestion of cold fluids result in artificially low oral temperatures, whereas the ingestion of hot liquids can artificially raise oral temperatures. For these reasons, oral measurement is not the method of choice among physiologists.




Core temperature is most accurately assessed by measuring the temperature of the blood as it enters the right atrium or measuring esophageal temperature. These measurements are invasive procedures, however, and are not practical for routinely measuring core temperature. Therefore, rectal temperature (T
re
) or gastrointestinal (T
GI
) temperature (via an ingested radio transmitter—see “Focus on Research”) is often used in laboratory and research settings to measure core body temperature.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Core Temperature during a Half Marathon






Advances in technology now permit temperature to be measured relatively noninvasively by swallowing a
 vitamin-sized telemetric temperature sensor. Core body temperature in the lower GI tract is then transmitted to a small recorder (see Photo).







This technology was used to continuously measure core temperature of male soldiers participating in a half marathon (21 km or 13.1 mi) in a tropical environment. The soldiers were heat acclimatized and regularly participated in fitness training. The soldiers consumed an average of 1.18 L of fluid before and during the race and lost an average of 2.89 L of sweat—meaning on average they replaced only about 42% of sweat loss. The accompanying graphs show their individual core temperatures by race finish time (panel A, 105–111 minutes; panel B, 111–117 minutes; panel C, 122–146 minutes).








These measurements highlight the considerable variability in core temperature response even in a relatively homogeneous group of young, trained, acclimatized soldiers. Also seen here is the magnitude of core temperature rise that these runners voluntarily achieved during a distance run in a hot, humid environment without medical consequence.








It is important to recognize that the core temperatures reported in this study do not indicate “safe” levels of core temperature for all individuals. Indeed, many unfit or unacclimatized individuals would suffer from heat illness at much lower core temperatures.

Although rectal and GI temperature measurements are accurate and reliable, they are not feasible for mass testing, nor are they routinely used to assess temperatures in exercise participants or athletes. Despite the importance of assessing body temperature for preventing and treating heat illness, there is no readily available, accurate, and convenient way of assessing core temperature in many situations such as athletic events. Often practitioners must rely on oral temperature measurements despite problems associated with this method. When appropriate, medical personnel often obtain rectal temperatures. Tympanic membrane (ear) temperatures (T
tym
) are sometimes used to measure body temperature, but these instruments do not accurately detect exercise-induced changes in body temperature and thus should not be used to assess exertional heat stress (

Casa and Armstrong, 2003

).




Skin temperature is not routinely measured in field settings, but it is important because it affects the amount of heat that can be exchanged with the environment. Heat moves down a thermal gradient (both between the core and the skin and between the skin and the environment). Therefore, more heat is lost from the body when the

 skin is considerably hotter than the environment (larger gradient) than when the two temperatures are similar (smaller gradient). In the same way, more heat is gained by the body when the environment is considerably hotter than the skin. Skin temperatures are measured with thermocouples attached to the skin.



Thermal Balance


Body temperature results from a balance between heat gain and heat loss (Figure 14.2
). Although heat can be gained from the environment, most heat is typically produced in the body by metabolic activity. Heat is a by-product of cellular respiration; at rest, the body liberates approximately 60–80% of the energy from aerobic metabolism as heat (see Figure 2.1
). The minimum energy required to meet the metabolic demands of the body at rest is called basal metabolic rate or resting metabolic rate; this accounts for a large proportion of the body’s heat production.









FIGURE 14.2
 Thermal Balance.
 Body temperature is maintained within a narrow range by a balance of heat gain and heat loss mechanisms.





The ingestion of food increases the body’s production of heat. This is known as
 thermogenesis
 (see
 
Chapter 8

). Muscular activity also increases heat production, including activity related to muscle tone and posture; activities of daily living (ADL), such as bathing, dressing, and meal preparation; and planned exercise. Because metabolism increases greatly during physical activity, heat production also increases dramatically.




Heat can be exchanged (gained or lost) from the body through four processes: radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation. The extent of heat gain or loss through these processes depends on environmental conditions: ambient temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.




Radiant
 heat loss occurs through the emission of electromagnetic heat waves to the environment. It depends on the thermal gradient between the body and the environment. When the environmental temperature equals the skin temperature, no heat is lost through radiation. If the environmental temperature exceeds the skin temperature, radiation adds to the heat load of the body.




Conduction
 involves the direct transfer of heat from one molecule in contact with another. Conduction in humans primarily involves contact between the skin and the molecules of air and other substances in contact with the skin. The extent of conductive heat loss depends on the thermal gradient between the skin and the molecules in contact with the skin and on the thermal properties of the molecules in contact with the skin. Because water absorbs and conducts heat much better than air, submersion in cool water can more rapidly lower body temperature.




Convective
 heat loss depends on the movement of the molecules in contact with the skin. When there is a breeze, heat loss is greater because the warmer molecules are moved away from the skin. Thus, the thermal gradient is maintained, and more heat is lost through conduction.




Evaporation
 is the conversion of liquid into vapor. The evaporation of unnoticed water from the skin, called
 insensible perspiration
, contributes to heat dissipation under resting and exercise conditions. However, the evaporation of sweat is the major mechanism for cooling the body under exercise conditions. Sweat is 99% water derived from plasma and released from eccrine glands. These glands are located throughout the body but are more concentrated on the forehead, hands, and feet (

Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

). The remaining 1% includes the electrolytes sodium (Na
+
),

 chloride (Cl
−
), and potassium (K
+
) and traces of amino acids, bicarbonate (HCO
3
−
), carbon dioxide (CO
2
), copper, glucose, hormones, iron, lactic acid, magnesium (Mg
2+
), nitrogen (N), phosphates (PO
4
−
), urea, vitamins, and zinc (

Murray, 1987

). The exact proportion of these elements in sweat varies among individuals and within the same individual under different conditions; it is also influenced by the individual’s fitness level (

Haymes and Wells, 1986

).




When the body is in
 thermal balance
, the amount of heat lost equals the amount of heat produced, and body temperature remains constant. In this situation, when all heat exchange processes are added, the sum is equal to zero. This can be shown by the following formula (

Winslow et al., 1939

):



14.1 




where M is metabolic heat production, R is radiant heat exchange, C is convective heat exchange, K is conductive heat exchange, and E is evaporative heat loss.




The ± sign for radiant, convective, and conductive processes indicates that heat can be lost or gained by the body through these mechanisms. When the environment is hotter than the skin temperature, heat is gained by the body (a + sign in the equation). When skin temperature is higher than the environment temperature, heat is lost from the body (a − sign in the equation). Evaporation cannot add to the heat load of the body. This mechanism can only dissipate heat; thus, there is only a negative sign in the equation for evaporation.



Heat Exchange


The exchange (transfer) of heat between the body and the environment occurs by the mechanisms just described: conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. Heat exchange is represented schematically in Figure 14.3
. These four mechanisms are important for dissipating heat to the environment under most conditions. However, when ambient temperatures are high, conduction, convection, and radiation may actually add heat to the body.









FIGURE 14.3
 Mechanisms of Heat Exchange and Percentage of Heat Loss.

The effectiveness of heat exchange between an individual and the environment is affected by five factors:




1.
 The thermal gradient




2.
 The relative humidity




3.
 Air movement




4.
 The degree of direct sunlight




5.
 The clothing worn




The greater the difference between two temperatures—called the thermal gradient—the greater the heat loss is from the warmer of the two. Typically, the body is warmer than the environment, so heat moves down its thermal gradient to the environment. More heat is lost in cooler environments because the thermal gradient is greater.




High humidity decreases evaporative heat loss from the body because the air is already largely saturated with water vapor. Relative humidity is the primary determinant of the extent of evaporative cooling; on humid days, evaporative cooling is limited. Although an exerciser may sweat profusely when humidity is high, the sweat does not evaporate as effectively.




Air movement increases convective heat loss from the skin to the environment. Thus, on windy days, more heat is lost from the body.




Direct sunlight can add considerably to the radiant heat load of an individual. Conversely, shade or cloud cover can often provide significant relief from heat.




Clothing also influences the extent of heat transfer with the environment. In cold weather, clothing protects against excessive heat loss. For example, long sleeve undershirts and tights are often added to football uniforms to help retain heat in cold weather outdoor games. Conversely, clothing can interfere with heat dissipation in hot weather by decreasing convective heat loss. Clothing that is lightweight, nonrestrictive, and light-colored promotes heat loss; heavy, dark clothing interferes with the dissipation of heat. Football uniforms, especially the protective padding, are an example of heavy, restrictive clothing that has been shown to increase physiological strain (

Armstrong et al., 2010

). Helmets, in particular, limit heat loss by encapsulating the head. The color of the clothing is also a consideration. Dark colors absorb light and thereby add to the

 radiant heat load; light colors reflect light. Thus, dark-colored uniforms can contribute to the heat stress of athletes as they play on a synthetic field that radiates heat in the hot sun. Short shirts and the use of mesh materials are attempts to aid in heat dissipation under these conditions.





Thermoregulation




The body regulates its internal body temperature within a narrow range despite wide variations in environmental temperatures. The process by which the body regulates body temperature is termed thermoregulation.


Normal Body Temperature


The human body typically regulates its temperature within approximately 1°C near 37°C (98.6°F) (Figure 14.4
). Maintaining temperature within this range is important because changes in body temperature dramatically affect biological function by altering chemical reactions and ultimately directly damaging body tissue. Although body temperature is carefully regulated, it is not consistent throughout the body. The core is tightly regulated to maintain a temperature near 37°C. The shell (skin), on the other hand, varies greatly in temperature because it is strongly influenced by environmental conditions.

 Range of Core Temperature and Associated Conditions.
 A range of temperatures is associated with each condition. A given temperature may fall into more than one category depending on individual characteristics. Source

Core body temperature fluctuates throughout the day (circadian rhythm) and is typically 0.7–0.8°C higher in the late afternoon than in the early morning hours. Core temperature can also vary throughout the menstrual cycle, increasing by 0.5–0.75°C at ovulation (

Stitt, 1993

).



Physiological Thermoregulation



Heat stress
 refers to physical work and environmental components that combine to create heat load on an individual. The physiological responses and resulting thermoregulatory processes that combat this heat stress are known as heat strain
. A relatively stable core temperature is achieved through the interaction of behavioral and physiological reactions to thermal stimuli. Core body temperature is controlled by regulatory centers in the hypothalamus. These regulatory centers can modify heat production by affecting muscular activity and can modify heat loss by changing skin blood flow and sweating. Two systems regulate body temperature: behavioral thermoregulation and physiological thermoregulation. Behavioral thermoregulation involves conscious efforts to regulate body temperature such as adding clothing or increasing activity to stay warm. Physiological thermoregulation involves the reflex control of effector organs (blood vessels, sweat glands, and skeletal muscle) to maintain temperature within homeostatic limits. Figure 14.5
 summarizes the thermoregulatory system that maintains core body temperature (Hall, 2016; Sawka and Wenger, 1988
).

 Several factors (biological rhythms, training and acclimatization, and circulating pyrogens) influence the core temperature set point (T

The hypothalamus is the primary integration center for the control of body temperature. The hypothalamus receives input from sensors that detect core body temperature and skin (shell) body temperature. These signals are compared to the body’s “set point” for temperature, and, if necessary, effector responses are initiated to increase heat production or facilitate heat loss. Importantly, during exercise, increased skeletal muscle activity is the primary factor that increases core temperature, which causes the hypothalamus to provide effector signals to increase heat dissipation through sweating and vasodilation.
 
Figure 14.6

 reveals how the primary heat dissipation mechanisms, sweating (

Figure 14.6A

) and vasodilation, shown in terms of blood flow (

Figure 14.6B

), are affected by changes in core temperature. As core temperature increases, sweating increases. Furthermore, sweating is greater at any given core temperature when the skin is warmer. Blood flow increases with increasing

 temperature when the skin is warm (35.5°C), but when the skin

 is cool (30.3°C), forearm blood flow remains steady until core temperature reaches approximately 37.5°C, at which time blood flow increases.

 is greater when the skin is warmer. Forearm blood flow (B)
 is constant with an increase of core temperature to approximately 37.5°C, after which blood flow increases with rising core temperature when skin temperature is approximately 30°C. When the skin is warm (35.5°C), any increase in core temperature is associated with increased blood flow. Sources

Exercise in the Heat




Many sporting events and recreational activities occur in hot environments. As just described, the body’s thermoregulatory system dissipates excess body heat resulting from muscle activity and environmental heat. However, strenuous exercise and environmental extremes can combine to overwhelm the thermoregulatory capacity of the body.


Body Temperature during Exercise in the Heat


Body temperature increases during prolonged exercise because heat production exceeds heat dissipation. As shown in Figure 14.7
, the increase in core temperature is proportional to the metabolic power output performed (measured in watts) and is largely independent of environmental temperature over a fairly wide range of temperatures. This suggests that the heat-dissipating mechanisms of the body can compensate for the increased metabolic heat production and stabilize body temperature. The term “prescriptive zone” is used to describe the combination of environmental conditions and work intensities at which thermoregulatory mechanisms are effective in preventing dangerous rises in body temperature during prolonged work (Lind, 1963
). More generally, this zone might also be described as a compensable zone, in which the thermoregulatory system can effectively compensate for increased metabolic heat production by increasing heat dissipation so that body temperature does not continue to rise, even though it reaches a steady state that is greater than resting body temperature.









FIGURE 14.7
 Core Temperature Responses during Exercise of Various Intensities (200–1,000 W) in Different Environmental Conditions.
 In the compensable zone, core temperature is elevated due to increased metabolic heat production but reaches a steady state because the body is able to dissipate the heat that is being generated. In the uncompensable zone, the heat-dissipating mechanism of the body cannot fully compensate for the increased heat production and body temperature continues to rise—sometimes dangerously. Source

 Modified from Lind (1963).





When the body cannot dissipate the metabolic heat generated during exercise, body temperature continues to rise (see
 
Figure 14.7

, area to the right of dashed line).
 Uncompensable heat stress
 is a condition in which the evaporative cooling that is needed is greater than the evaporative cooling permitted by the environment (

Montain et al., 1994

;
 
Sawka and Pandolf, 2001

). During uncompensable heat stress, steady-state core temperature cannot be achieved and body temperature continues to rise until exhaustion occurs. Uncompensable heat stress is associated with exhaustion from heat strain at relatively low core temperatures (

Montain et al., 1994

;
 
Sawka and Pandolf, 2001

).

Hyperthermia
 The increase in body temperature with exercise.




Heat Exchange during Exercise


Heat production and heat transfer occur by the same mechanisms during exercise as they do at rest. However, during exercise the total body metabolism may increase to 15–20 times the resting rate (Sawka and Pandolf, 1990
). In this situation, metabolic heat production may increase to a greater extent than heat dissipation; thus, the body stores heat and body temperature increases. The increase in body temperature with exercise is termed hyperthermia
.



Metabolic heat produced in the muscles is transported to the core of the body and skin by the blood. Heat is also transferred to the skin and exchanged with the environment by conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. Two physiological mechanisms allow the body to dissipate heat in an attempt to maintain thermal balance during exercise: an increase in sweating rate and vasodilation of the cutaneous (skin) vessels. Evaporative cooling of sweat is the primary mechanism by which the body cools itself during exercise in warm temperatures.

 Vasodilation of cutaneous vessels brings the warm blood close to the body’s surface so that heat can be dissipated to the environment via conduction, radiation, and convection, assuming that the ambient temperature is cooler than the body.





Figure 14.8

 depicts the relative importance of heat exchange mechanisms during 60 minutes of cycling exercise (900 kpm·min
−1
) at various ambient temperatures. Total heat loss (THL) remains relatively constant across a wide range of ambient temperatures. The fact that the metabolic heat production (M) exceeds the THL accounts for the increased temperature that occurs with exercise.
 
Figure 14.8

 reinforces the earlier observation that the increase in body temperature (heat storage) is relatively constant over a wide range of ambient temperatures as long as the work rate is constant. This is true because the metabolic heat production depends on the amount of work being done, regardless of temperature. The THL also remains the same. Thus, the difference between metabolic heat production and THL—that is, heat storage—is constant. Although THL remains relatively constant, it occurs through different processes at different ambient temperatures. At high temperatures, evaporative heat loss is primary, and radiant and convective heat losses are less effective. This combination is effective, however, only when the humidity is low enough to allow sweat to evaporate. In high humidity, evaporative heat loss is less effective, and heat storage (body temperature) increases. This explains why temperature and humidity must be considered together (using the heat index in
 
Figure 14.1

, or the WBGT) for determining when activity is safe.

 Exercise was performed for 60 minutes at the work rate of 900 kpm·min−1
 at each ambient temperature. Notice that the metabolic heat produced and the THL (and thus the heat storage) are constant over a wide range of temperatures (~10–36°C; 50–97°F), although they are achieved via different mechanisms. Evaporative heat loss becomes increasingly important as ambient temperature increases. Source

During heavy exercise, the sweat rate can increase dramatically. Sweat rates vary considerably among individuals, depending on genetics and fitness level. A fit person begins sweating at a lower body temperature and sweats more profusely. For any one individual, sweat rate depends on environmental conditions, exercise intensity, fitness level, degree of acclimatization, and hydration status.
 
Figure 14.9

 estimates hourly sweating rates for running at various speeds in different environmental conditions (

Sawka and Pandolf, 1990

). Notice how common it is for sweating rates to exceed 1 L·hr
−1
 of sweat. Clearly, such a water loss will lead to a decrease in total body water and plasma volume and will have deleterious effects on cardiovascular function if fluid is not replaced. The evaporation of sweat is the primary defense against heat stress. Sweating itself does not cool the body; the sweat must evaporate. The evaporation of sweat produces a cooling of the body because energy is needed to convert the liquid sweat into a vapor, and this energy is extracted from the immediate surroundings. The amount of energy needed for the evaporation of sweat can be quantified: 580 kcal of heat energy is released for each liter of water that is vaporized (

Hall, 2016

).

Cardiovascular Demands of Exercise in the Heat




As discussed fully in previous chapters, the cardiovascular system responds to exercise by increasing blood flow to the active tissue to support energy production.
 The cardiovascular system is also directly involved in thermoregulation and heat dissipation in particular. The cardiovascular system faces several interrelated challenges when exercise is performed in hyperthermic conditions:



1.
 The skin and the muscles compete for blood flow. The muscles need increased blood flow to meet the demands of metabolic activity, and the skin needs increased blood flow to dissipate heat from the body’s core.




2.
 Vasodilation in cutaneous vessels effectively decreases venous return, thus decreasing stroke volume. Therefore, cardiac output may be reduced at a time when the demands for flow are greatest (

Rowell, 1986

).




3.
 Sweating results in a reduced plasma volume, contributing to the reduction in stroke volume and, therefore, cardiac output.




4.
 Adequate blood pressure must be maintained to perfuse the vital organs, including the brain, kidney, and liver. The ability to maintain blood pressure is challenged by widespread vasodilation in the skeletal muscle beds and cutaneous vessels, which decreases total peripheral resistance.





Figure 14.10

 presents cardiovascular responses to various intensities of exercise (light, moderate, and heavy) under hot and thermoneutral conditions. As seen in
 
Figure 14.10A

, during short-term, light submaximal exercise, cardiac output increases to a similar degree in both hot and thermoneutral environments (

Rowell, 1974

). However, cardiac output in a hot environment is achieved by a higher heart rate (

Figure 14.10C

) and a lower stroke volume (

Figure 14.10B

) than in a thermoneutral environment. This reduced stroke volume occurs during hot conditions because of sweating and vasodilation in the cutaneous vessels, which decreases central venous volume. Mean arterial pressure is similar to or only slightly lower in hot environments than in thermoneutral environments because of vasoconstriction in the kidneys and digestive tract.

During prolonged, heavy submaximal exercise in the heat, cardiac output increases less than in a thermoneutral environment (

Figure 14.10A

). Cardiac output in hot environments fails to reach levels attained under thermoneutral conditions during heavy exercise because stroke volume declines progressively as the intensity of exercise increases. Although the heart rate is higher, it cannot compensate fully for the reduced stroke volume during heavy exercise in hot conditions. Thus, cardiac output is lower in hot conditions than in thermoneutral conditions.




During long-term, heavy submaximal exercise in the heat, vasoconstriction occurs in the digestive and renal areas in an attempt to maintain mean arterial blood pressure. Vasoconstriction may result in ischemia and even tissue damage in extreme conditions (

Rowell, 1986

). The regulatory mechanisms that maintain blood pressure are stressed by the excessive water loss that occurs with profuse sweating. If this fluid is not replaced, stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure will decrease. Additionally, performance will suffer, and heat illness becomes increasingly likely.




Maximal cardiac output during incremental exercise to maximum is lower when performed in hot conditions than in thermoneutral conditions. This decreased cardiac output results from a lower stroke volume, because maximal heart rate is unchanged, although maximal heart rate may occur earlier in the heat. The estimated distribution of cardiac output during an incremental exercise test performed under neutral and hot conditions is presented in
 
Figure 14.11

.

When exercise is performed in a hot environment, it cannot be performed as long as in cooler conditions. Consequently, 

 is lower in a hot environment (Figure 14.11B
). Cardiac output increases during exercise in both conditions. However, cardiac output at 

 is less in the hot environment, presumably because blood is displaced in cutaneous veins, thus decreasing venous return and stroke volume. Blood flow to the active skeletal muscles increases throughout exercise in both conditions. However, blood flow to skeletal muscle is a smaller proportion of total blood flow in a hot environment than in a thermoneutral environment, because skin blood flow accounts for a larger portion of the blood flow in the hot environment. At 

 in the hot condition, visceral blood flow is severely reduced in an effort to support the muscles with adequate blood flow and maintain blood pressure. The lower cardiac output and the decrease in blood flow when maximal exercise is performed in a hot environment both contribute to a lower 

 and an earlier onset of fatigue.


Factors Affecting Cardiovascular Response to Exercise in the Heat


Several factors affect an individual’s response to exercise in the heat. The following sections discuss four key factors: acclimatization, cardiovascular fitness, body composition, and hydration level.


Acclimatization



Acclimatization
 refers to adaptive changes in an individual who undergoes prolonged or repeated exposure to a stressful environment; these changes reduce the physiological strain produced by such an environment. Although acclimatization and acclimation are often used interchangeably, scientists distinguish between acclimation
—which is a short-term adaptation (i.e., one that occurs in days or weeks) that is induced in a laboratory—and acclimatization—which is an adaptation that occurs over a longer time period and occurs in a natural climate. Acclimatization to heat results from repeated exposure to heat sufficient to increase core body temperature and elicit moderate to profuse sweating (Werner, 1993
). Repeated exercise in hot climatic conditions results in improved efficiency of the thermoregulatory responses, augmented cardiovascular function, and enhanced endurance performance (Tipton et al., 2008
). Light to moderate exercise in the heat for 1–2 hours a day can lead to positive adaptations within a few days.





Acclimatization
 The adaptive changes that occur when an individual undergoes prolonged or repeated exposure to a stressful environment; these changes reduce the physiological strain produced by such an environment.





Acclimatization to heat involves several underlying mechanisms:




1.
 An expansion of plasma volume that leads to an enhanced cardiac output during exercise and a decrease in heart rate and cardiovascular strain at a given level of exercise in the heat (

Lorenzo et al., 2010

;
 
Nielsen et al., 1993

).




2.
 Sweating begins earlier and at a lower body temperature.




3.
 The sweating rate for a given core temperature is higher and can be maintained longer (

Tipton et al., 2008

;
 
Wenger, 1988

).





Figure 14.12

 compares changes in rectal temperature, heart rate, and sweating rate during 4 hours of aerobic exercise before and after acclimatization (

Wyndham et al., 1964

). These data support the benefits of heat acclimatization in lowering thermal and cardiovascular strain. Proper acclimatization ensures that individuals can perform longer and more safely in the heat.

Fitness Leve
l


Aerobic fitness improves an individual’s thermoregulatory function and heat tolerance (Wenger, 1988
). Endurance training results in a lower resting core temperature, a larger plasma volume, an earlier onset of sweating, and a smaller decrease in plasma volume during exercise (Drinkwater, 1984
; Werner, 1993
). Therefore, individuals who are aerobically fit are better able to handle the cardiovascular demands of exercise in hot conditions than sedentary individuals. High-intensity interval training in thermoneutral conditions also decreases the time required for acclimatization to exercise in a hot environment (Cohen and Gisolfi, 1982
). In fact, exercise training results in an expansion of the plasma volume. Thus, many of the changes in cardiovascular function that are seen when repeated bouts of exercise are used to induce acclimatization may primarily reflect a training adaptation (Tschakovsky and Pyke, 2008
).


Body Composition


Excessive body fat is a liability for thermoregulation during exercise in the heat. Greater adiposity contributes to heat stress by two primary mechanisms. First, adipose tissue interferes with the dissipation of heat; body fat acts to insulate the core. Second, body fat adds to the metabolic cost of activity by adding weight to the body that must be moved. Heat illness is more common in overweight individuals and is more likely to be fatal to these individuals (Bedno et al., 2010
; Henshell, 1967
).


Hydration Level


An individual’s level of hydration has a large impact on exercise tolerance and on the cardiovascular responses to long-term exercise in the heat. A decrease in body water, termed dehydration or hypohydration, leads to several negative effects on physiological function, including cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, metabolic, and central nervous system impairments that become increasingly greater as dehydration worsens (Murray, 2007
). Dehydration increases physiological strain and perceived effort for the same absolute amount of exercise and this effect is exacerbated when exercise is performed in the heat (ACSM, 2007a
). Not only does dehydration lead to greater physiological strain, but research demonstrates that dehydration also leads to impaired performance. Although there is still considerable debate on precisely how much body water can be lost before performance is affected, there is strong evidence that dehydration greater than 2% of body weight leads to impaired performance in endurance events (Murray, 2007
). Short-term anaerobic events and muscular power events appear to be less affected by modest dehydration.



Body water accounts for 65–70% of the total body mass of an average adult. Water balance is generally well regulated on a daily basis as long as water and food are readily available (

Sawka et al., 2005

). However, during long-term exercise in the heat, if fluid is not replaced, profuse

 sweating leads to large acute losses of total body water and a reduction in plasma volume (

Wade and Freund, 1990

). The reduced plasma volume, in turn, leads to decreased stroke volume and an increased heart rate during prolonged exercise. Therefore, it is recommended that fluid ingestion during exercise be sufficient to prevent excessive dehydration (>2% of body weight) and excessive loss of electrolytes to prevent compromised performance and health risks. Individuals vary considerably in the amount of sweat lost during activity, because of both external factors (such as the exercise intensity and duration, environmental conditions, clothing) and individual factors (such as genetic makeup, heat acclimatization, initial hydration status, and training and health status). Thus, unfortunately, general recommendations about fluid ingestion are not feasible. Instead, it is recommended that individuals develop a personalized fluid replacement plan to ensure that dehydration does not account for more than 2% of their body weight during exercise (

ACSM, 2007a

). Careful monitoring of body weight following an exercise bout is necessary to determine an individual’s typical sweat loss with exercise and the required fluid intake to offset this loss.




Thirst is an inadequate stimulus for adequately replacing the fluid lost during exercise. Even with unlimited access to water, most individuals do not voluntarily consume enough water to replace the water lost during physical activity, resulting in a relative state of dehydration.
 Voluntary dehydration
 refers to exercise-induced dehydration that develops despite an individual’s unlimited access to water.
 
Figure 14.13

 shows the sweat loss and voluntary fluid intake of men and women in various sports. Clearly, voluntary fluid intake does not fully replace sweat loss. Thus, the coach or exercise leader needs to encourage participants to consume fluid beyond what thirst dictates. Experts recommend that proper hydration be achieved by paying attention to prehydration, fluid ingestion during exercise, and rehydration following exercise (

ACSM, 2007a

). See the Focus on Application box for additional details.

Voluntary Dehydration

Hydration status is particularly important in sports where competition occurs by weight class and many athletes attempt to “make weight” by getting rid of fluid. Although the NCAA and many US high school federations attempt to regulate weight throughout the season for wrestlers (see
 
Chapter 8

), this is not the case throughout the world, for all combat sport participants, nor for major events such as the Olympics. As a result, hypohydration is a problem. A recent study conducted on elite Swedish wrestlers, judokas, boxers, and taekwondo athletes found that 42% of both male and female participants (wrestling and taekwondo), despite weighing in the evening before had serious hypohydration the following morning—the morning of competition. Fully 50% of the judokas and boxers who weighed in the morning of competition were similarly seriously hypohydrated. Thus, neither a longer time for rehydration with an evening before weigh-in nor a shorter timed weigh-in prior to competition that was assumed would discourage extreme weight changes was able to prevent hypohydration before competition (

Pettersson & Berg, 2014

).



Fluid Ingestion during and after Exercise


During heavy exercise, metabolic heat production in active muscles increases up to 100 times that of inactive muscle. If this heat were not dissipated, the internal temperature would rise 1°C every 5–8 minutes, resulting in
 overheating (hyperthermia) and collapse of the individual within 15–20 minutes. Thus, sweating under these conditions is absolutely essential (Nadel, 1988
). However, sweating does not occur without a price—the removal of fluid from the body (Maughan, 1991
). A 70-kg, 2:30 marathoner can lose 5 L of body water, or 1–2 L·hr−1
. As previously described, sweat is not pure water but contains a variety of substances. The most important electrolytes are sodium (Na+
), chloride (Cl−
), and potassium (K+
).



Although shifts in internal water compartments provide the liquid portion of sweat, ultimately some of the water lost through sweating comes from blood plasma. If this water is not replaced, the individual may perform poorly and suffer from heat injuries. If fluid loss during exercise is adequately and appropriately replaced, cardiorespiratory variables can be maintained or undergo smaller disruptions from homeostasis (Moreno et al., 2012).

Exercise and Fluid Replacement






The ACSM publishes a wide variety of Position Stands on issues related to Exercise, Physical Activity, and Health (go to thepoint.lww.com/Plowman5e
 for a complete list). These pronouncements written by members of the ACSM represent research-based consensus views from leading experts in the area. The Position Stand titled “Exercise and Fluid Replacement” provides important recommendations about fluid and electrolyte requirements during physical activity and a review of research documenting the effect of hydration status on performance, physiology, and health. The accompanying tables summarize the goals and recommendations for prehydration, fluid intake during physical activity, and postexercise rehydration and estimate the approximate fluid intake needed to compensate for the sweating rate of individuals of different body sizes who are running at different speeds in different environmental conditions. It is recommended that changes in body weight be directly measured by individuals to personalize their fluid replacement regimes.

Type of Fluid Ingested


Whether to supplement with plain water or a carbohydrate and/or electrolyte beverage (sports drink) has
 been much debated. For the vast majority of sports or fitness workouts, plain water is the beverage of choice (Figure 14.14
), but endurance events may be the exception (American Dietetic Association, 1987
; Coyle, 2004
).









FIGURE 14.14
 Water is an Appropriate Beverage to Replace Fluid Loss during Most Types of Physical Activity.





The rate at which any ingested fluid enters the body’s water supply depends on the rate at which it leaves the stomach (
gastric emptying
) and the rate at which it is absorbed across the intestinal membrane (
intestinal absorption
). Both gastric emptying and intestinal absorption are influenced by the composition of the ingested fluid.




Three factors affect gastric emptying. First, the gastric-emptying rate decreases as the caloric content of the ingested fluid increases. However, the differences in the gastric-emptying rate of solutions of 2.5–10% carbohydrate are negligible and are similar to that of plain water (

Coleman, 1988

;
 
Maughan, 1991

). Second, the rate of gastric emptying is exponentially related to the volume of fluid in the stomach (

Maughan, 1991

;
 
Murray, 1987

). That is, the amount of fluid emptied from the stomach is relatively large in the first minutes and then the rate slows down. Therefore, frequent ingestion of small amounts of fluid is preferable to infrequent ingestion of large amounts; 200–400 mL of fluid should be ingested every 15–30 minutes, because approximately 400 mL can be cleared in 15 minutes (

American Dietetic Association, 1987

;
 
Nieman, 1990

). Third, the temperature of the fluid may be relevant. Although it has been suggested that cold sports drinks enhance gastric emptying, the evidence suggests that the gastric-emptying rates of hot and cold beverages are the same (

Maughan, 1991

). The real advantage of a cold drink may simply be that it tastes better to a hot, sweaty athlete, thereby encouraging more drinking. In addition, a cold fluid does not add heat to the body, as a hot fluid would. Fluid temperatures of 15–22°C (59–72°F) are recommended (

ACSM, 2007a

).




Intestinal absorption is not influenced by as many factors as gastric emptying. However, research has shown that glucose combined with sodium greatly increases intestinal fluid absorption compared to plain water. Thus, small percentages of glucose do not inhibit gastric emptying but enhance intestinal absorption if accompanied by sodium.




Although it has been claimed that electrolytes make sports drinks more palatable and hence encourage drinking, evidence indicates that sodium is the only physiologically beneficial electrolyte consumed during exercise (

Maughan, 1991

;
 
Murray, 1987

). Evidence does not indicate that matching the content of sweat—even if this were possible, considering its extreme variability—is necessary in replacement fluid (

Haymes and Wells, 1986

). Despite considerable attention given to potassium loss, its loss in sweat is low and of little consequence during exercise. The general consensus is that electrolyte losses will be replaced through normal food intake after exercise, with the possible exception of sodium. Sodium appears to be important in postexercise beverages for reasons other than intestinal absorption. After exercise, if drinks with little or no sodium are ingested, the plasma becomes diluted, stimulating urine production and fluid excretion. This also shuts off the thirst drive, delaying rehydration (

ACSM, 2007a

;
 
Maughan, 1991

;
 
Nose et al., 1988

). Once again, however, if some is good, more is not better. Salt tablets should never be ingested because highly concentrated amounts of salt can lead to GI discomfort, dehydration, and electrolyte loss (

Steen, 1994

).




Because most commercially available sports drinks (see
 
Table 6.4

 in
 
Chapter 6

) contain varying amounts of electrolytes other than sodium, some have wondered whether these other electrolytes may be harmful. Studies have not provided evidence one way or the other. However, no cases of problems arising from the ingestion of commercial sports drinks have been reported in the literature (

Nose et al., 1988

). One would assume, given the ongoing debate about such products, that such incidences would have been publicized had they occurred. It is important to note, however, that sports drinks differ significantly from “energy” drinks. Sports drinks are designed to aid in rehydration whereas energy drinks are designed to increase alertness or prevent fatigue. Energy drinks should not be used to rehydrate. In fact, caution is warranted in using energy drinks, which contain high levels of caffeine and other stimulants, before or during physical activity because of reports that these drinks can worsen heat stress and dehydration, and are related to deaths in some cases (

Seifert et al., 2011

).




In situations where fluid replacement is more important than energy substrate supplementation (such as in a relatively short endurance event of 1–2 hours or an activity in high heat and humidity), the carbohydrate concentration of the sports drink should be low (2.5–8%) and the sodium content moderately high

 (30–110 mg). To put this amount of sodium in context, an 8-oz glass of 2% milk or tomato juice contains over 100 mg of sodium. Conversely, in those situations where substrate provision is needed (a long endurance event of over 2 hours in temperate environmental conditions), a more concentrated carbohydrate solution (6–10%) with sodium should be ingested (

Maughan, 1991

;
 
Murray, 1987

).



Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia (EAH)


While it is clear that dehydration can lead to impaired performance and serious health problems, it is also clear that excessive fluid ingestion can also be dangerous—even fatal. If large quantities of fluids are ingested in events lasting longer than 4 hours, hyponatremia (low sodium, sometimes called “water intoxication”) may occur. Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH)
 is the occurrence of hyponatremia during or up to 24 hours after prolonged physical activity; it is diagnosed by a plasma sodium concentration below normal values (usually 135 mmol·L−1
) (Hew-Butler et al., 2008
). Hyponatremia not only affects performance but can lead to brain damage and death. Death due to hyponatremia has been reported following marathons, ultraendurance events, and military training (Nolte et al., 2015
). The primary cause of hyponatremia during exercise is sustained overdrinking, in which fluid ingestion exceeds fluid loss through sweating and urination. Risk factors associated with the development of EAH include excessive drinking behavior, weight gain during exercise, low body weight, female sex, slow running or performance pace, and event inexperience (Hew-Butler et al., 2008
). Recent research also indicates that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases the risk of developing EAH (ACSM, 2007a
; Wharam et al., 2006
). Thus, in ultraendurance events athletes are urged to drink electrolyte beverages in addition to water and to avoid fluid consumption in excess of fluid loss.

Influence of Sex and Age on the Exercise Response in Heat




Male-Female Differences in Exercise Response in Heat


Most scientific evidence suggests that the response of individuals to exercise in a hot environment depends more on the state of their cardiovascular system and their hydration status than on their sex (Drinkwater, 1984
; Stephenson and Kolka, 1988
, 1993
). A confounding factor, however, is the phase of the menstrual cycle. Core temperature is greater, at rest and during exercise, in the luteal phase (days 14–28) than in the follicular phase (days 1–13) of the menstrual cycle (Pivarnik et al., 1992
; Stephenson and Kolka, 1993
). Although early studies reported that women experienced more heat strain than men when both performed the same absolute work, the women in these studies were working at a higher percentage of maximal effort, and core temperature response to exercise is related more to relative exercise intensity than absolute intensity (Drinkwater, 1984
). Studies that have matched subjects for fitness level, body size, body fat, and degree of heat acclimatization have found few thermoregulatory differences between the sexes, particularly if the phase of the menstrual cycle was controlled for (Stephenson and Kolka, 1988
).



There does appear to be a difference between the sexes in sweating response. Females generally sweat less and rely more on convection and conduction to dissipate heat than men. Males begin sweating at a lower core temperature and have a greater sweat rate and loss of electrolytes in humid conditions than similarly trained females (

ACSM, 2007a

;
 
Avellini et al., 1980a

;
 
Drinkwater, 1984

). Whether this difference is an asset or a liability to males is unknown. Some researchers have suggested that the higher sweat production of males is inefficient and wasteful and that females have the advantage of sweating less and thus decreasing blood volume to a lesser extent (

Avellini et al., 1980b

;
 
Wyndham et al., 1965

). Others counter that higher sweat rates might be advantageous in situations where evaporative heat loss is important, such as in a drier environment (

Frye and Kamon, 1981

). Although the sweating response is slightly different in males and females, heart rate and core temperature responses to exercise in the heat are similar (

Frye and Kamon, 1983

). Heat acclimatization also produces similar results in both sexes (

Frye and Kamon, 1983

).



Exercise Response of Children and Adolescents in the Heat


Thermoregulatory responses are different between adults and children. Heat is produced by active muscle mass but dissipated by exposed surface area. Despite a lower muscle mass, children produce more metabolic heat during the same amount of weight-bearing exercise (walking, running) than adults. On the other hand, the surface area-to-mass ratio is greater in children than in adults. This progressively decreases during growth and maturation until the adolescent reaches adult size. Therefore, in thermoneutral or moderate heat situations, the higher metabolic heat production of children is compensated for, to a large extent, by a relatively larger body surface area over which to dissipate this heat by dry heat exchange (radiation, convection, conduction). Thus,
 children rely less on evaporative cooling than adults. However, in high heat situations, this variation becomes a liability. Not only does the higher metabolic heat production continue but the body absorbs heat from the surroundings over this larger surface area, and evaporative cooling may not be able to sufficiently compensate (Falk, 1998
).



With high ambient temperatures, sweat evaporation is the main process for heat dissipation, and this requires the involvement of sweat glands. Children have the same total number of sweat glands as adults by the age of 2 or 3 years, and thus children have a higher number of sweat glands per unit of area than adolescents or adults. However, sweat gland size and sensitivity appear directly related to age. Sensitivity is lower in children, meaning that the threshold at which sweating begins is higher; it takes longer for sweating to start and the rate of sweating may be different in children and adolescents than in adults. Sweat rate is the best indicator for evaporative heat loss. Sweat rates are lower (by as much as 40%) in boys than in young adult males. The sweat rate increases progressively in young males both per gland and per surface area as they progress from prepubertal to midpubertal and late pubertal stages of maturation. Girls appear to sweat less than boys, but most studies have not found any difference between prepubertal girls and adult females in sweat rate (

Falk, 1998

;
 
Meyer et al., 1992

;
 
Rowland, 2005

).




The effectiveness of thermoregulation is judged by the stability of core temperature. In children, the body can prevent a detrimental rise in core temperature with exercise in the heat as well as adults under moderate conditions. However, when the ambient temperature is very high or exceeds skin temperature by 5–10°C, symptoms of fatigue and intolerance are more common in children than in adults (

Rowland, 2005

).




There is no clear evidence that exercise affects the level of dehydration or circulatory function more in children than in adults. The size of voluntary dehydration does not appear to differ across the age span (

Rowland, 2005

), although voluntary dehydration is typically not a problem in activities lasting less than 45 minutes for children. However, the same degree of dehydration, corrected for body weight, results in a greater core temperature rise in children than adults during exercise in the heat. The levels of sodium and chloride in children’s sweat during exercise in a hot environment are lower, and the level of potassium is higher, compared with adults. However, these differences do not require most currently available sports drinks to be diluted for children. Evidence suggests that adding flavoring and enriching water with sodium chloride (NaCl) and carbohydrates (as in sports drinks) increases voluntary ingestion in children and adolescents and, when freely available, can prevent dehydration (

Falk, 1998

;
 
Kenney and Chiu, 2001

).




Aerobic training improves heat tolerance and thermoregulatory effectiveness in adults but has only a minor effect in children (

Bar-Or and Rowland, 2004

). However, children, adolescents, and adults all appear to successfully acclimatize to heat. The main difference is the rate of acclimatization, although the time period needed for acclimatization may not vary. For example, at the end of 2 weeks, both children and adults may have acclimatized, but throughout the process adult adaptations (sweat rate, core temperatures, etc.) are ahead of the children’s (

Falk, 1998

). Children should undergo a long and gradual acclimatization program to ensure that they are physiologically prepared for exercise in the heat (

Rowland, 1990

). Children subjectively feel acclimatized before physiological acclimatization has occurred, and thus they are likely to try to do too much too soon (

Falk, 1998

).



Exercise Response of Older Adults in the Heat


Cardiac output increases above resting levels during exercise in the heat for both young and older individuals. However, at higher workloads, the increase in cardiac output is not as great when exercise is performed in the heat as when it is performed under thermoneutral conditions (see Figure 14.10
). The increase in cardiac output during exercise in a hot environment is less in older persons than in younger individuals of similar fitness levels (Kenney and Anderson, 1988
). Furthermore, it appears that young adults increase cardiac output by augmenting heart rate, but older individuals increase cardiac output by increasing stroke volume (Kenney and Anderson, 1988
). This helps explain why differences exist in cardiac output at higher workloads; apparently, there is a limit to the extent to which older individuals can increase stroke volume.



Exercise-induced reductions in plasma volume are greater in older individuals than in young individuals when they exercise in hot and humid conditions. When exercising at the same relative workload, young and older individuals demonstrate similar changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. The accompanying Focus on Research box explores the influence of age and fitness level on thermoregulatory (temperature, forearm blood flow, and sweating) responses to exercise. As noted in the Focus on Research box, there is no difference in core temperature between young and older individuals when they exercise in the heat when the individuals are matched for fitness level. Furthermore, acclimatization to heat results in similar changes in older individuals and in young people (

Best et al., 2014

;
 
Pandolf et al., 1988

).




It has been shown that whole body heat loss is significantly reduced in older versus younger individuals when doing physical activity in the heat. This impairment in heat dissipation is evident as early as age 40 years (

Kenny et al., 2015

;
 
Larose et al., 2013

). See the Focus on Research box for a discussion of this exercise response.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Heat Dissipation and Age






The two primary physiological mechanisms to dissipate heat are an increased sweat rate and an increased skin blood flow. It has long been known that the ability to dissipate heat during exercise in hot environments declines with increasing age. However, for many years, it was unclear what physiological mechanisms caused the alterations in sweat rate and skin blood flow that occur as a person ages. The obvious way to explore an answer to this question is to design a study that compares younger adults with their older counterparts. However, one inherent difficulty in such studies is that older adults typically have a lower 

. It is known that an increase in 

 is associated with an earlier onset of sweating, presumably because in a trained individual, the body has adapted to maintain thermal balance more effectively. Thus, it has been unclear whether aging itself or the age-related decline in 

 is responsible for the decreased sweating and reduced heat loss in older exercisers.







To overcome these difficulties, Tankersley et al. designed a study that compared young normally fit individuals to a group of older normally fit individuals and to a group of older highly fit individuals during 20 minutes of submaximal exercise (67.5% of
 

). Thus, the younger group could be compared to an older group with a lower
 

 (the normally fit older group) and an older group with a similar
 

 (the highly fit older group). The accompanying graphs present the esophageal temperature, chest sweating rate, and forearm blood flow in the three groups.








The graphs indicate the following:






1.
 Esophageal temperature during the exercise was not different among the three groups working at the same relative workload. However, because the normally fit older group had the lowest
 

, they were working at a lower absolute workload and thus should be producing less metabolic heat. Therefore, the fact that the increased temperature among the three groups was similar may indicate an impaired ability to dissipate heat in the normally fit older group compared to the two groups with a higher
 

.




2.
 In general, the average forearm blood flow and chest sweating rates for the highly fit older individuals were intermediate to those in the normally fit older group and the normally fit younger group.




3.
 The normally fit older individuals had a lower forearm blood flow and lower sweating response during most of the exercise protocol compared to the normally fit younger individuals.






These results suggest that younger and older subjects matched for similar
 

 have similar heat loss responses to submaximal exercise. Therefore, it appears that the decreased
 

 that typically accompanies aging is primarily responsible for the changes in sweating and blood flow reported in older adults. A person who maintains a high fitness level as he or she ages is not likely to experience these detrimental changes in the thermoregulatory response to aging.

Heat Illness





The magnitude of cardiovascular stress placed on the body by exercise in the heat was addressed in compelling language by Loring Rowell over 30 years ago:


Probably the greatest stress ever imposed on the human cardiovascular system (except for hemorrhage) is the combination of exercise and hyperthermia. Together these stresses can present life-threatening challenges, especially in highly motivated athletes who drive themselves to extremes in hot environments (Rowell 1986
).



When the cardiovascular system cannot meet the thermoregulatory and metabolic demands of the body, heat illness ensues.
 Exertional heat illness (EHI)
 involves a range of disorders resulting specifically from the combined stresses of exertion and heat stress. This is the type of heat illness that is most likely to be encountered by exercise professionals.

 EHI can be defined as a range of multisystem illnesses related to elevated body core temperature (hyperthermia) and the cardiovascular and metabolic responses that result from exercise and the body’s attempts at thermoregulation. EHI varies greatly in severity and includes exertional dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat injury, and heatstroke. One of the greatest challenges of EHI is that it is often difficult or impossible to distinguish among these disorders because they often overlap and frequently evolve into a different form over time (

Gardner and Kark, 2001

).






Exertional Heat Illness (EHI)
 A range of multisystem illnesses related to elevated body core temperature and the cardiovascular and metabolic processes that result from exercise and the body’s thermoregulatory response.




Exertional Heat Illness Syndromes


EHI syndromes involve the physiological disruption of several organs or systems and can vary in severity. Figure 14.15
 depicts the major EHI syndromes in terms of physiological disruption and severity. Within each category along the EHI range (minor to serious), there can be different levels of physiological disruption, and each illness may differ in severity and consequence. Furthermore, the shading within the figure reinforces the considerable overlap among the EHS syndromes and suggests that clear distinctions among them are not always possible (Gardner and Kark, 2001
). Although clinicians have long sought to categorize heat illnesses in discrete categories, and have attempted to use core temperature as a way to define thresholds for defining categories, current thought is that such categorization is not possible and that body temperature alone does not accurately reveal the severity of heat illness.









FIGURE 14.15
 Spectrum of EHIs.




Minor Exertional Heat Illness


Minor EHI includes mild dehydration, heat cramps, and heat syncope (Carter et al., 2006
; Gardner and Kark, 2001
). Symptoms of heat stress may be nonspecific, particularly in the early stages of heat illness. As heat illness progresses, so does the severity of orthostatic signs and symptoms (Table 14.2
).



TABLE 14.2
 Symptoms of Exertional Heat Illness (EHI)







Heat cramps
 are an acute disorder consisting of brief, recurrent, and excruciating pain in the voluntary muscles of the legs, arms, or abdomen. Typically, the muscles have recently been engaged in intense physical activity and are fatigued. Heat cramps may result from a fluid-electrolyte imbalance. Profuse sweaters who lose large quantities of sodium may be more susceptible than others. Skeletal muscle heat cramps frequently occur in football and tennis players competing in late summer or early fall heat and humidity (

ACSM, 2007a

,

b

), but other athletes are not immune. A combination of rest, stretching, and ingestion of fluids or foods containing NaCl typically leads to recovery.
 Heat syncope
 (fainting) is characterized by vertigo (dizziness) and weakness during or following standing or with a rapid change to the upright posture during heat stress (

Carter et al., 2006

). Syncope is often related to low blood pressure, which is corrected as the person becomes supine. Of course, fainting can also result in injury if the person hits their head as they fall. Syncope can also be indicative of more serious heat-related injuries

.



Serious Exertional Heat Illnesses


Serious EHIs include heat exhaustion, heat injury, and heatstroke (Carter et al., 2006
). Exertional heat exhaustion
 is characterized by an inability to maintain adequate cardiac output and moderate (38.5°C; 101.3°F) to high (>40°C; 104°F) body temperatures. The person experiences a rapid and weak pulse, fatigue, weakness, profuse sweating, psychological disorientation, and fainting. Heat exhaustion is caused by an acute fluid loss and the inability of the cardiovascular system to adequately compensate for the concurrent demands of muscle and skin blood flow.





Exertional Heat Exhaustion
 A moderate illness characterized by an inability to maintain adequate cardiac output at moderate (38.5°C) to high (>40°C) body temperatures.



Exertional Heat Injury
 A moderate to severe progressive multisystem disorder, with hyperthermia accompanied by organ damage or severe dysfunction.



Exertional Heatstroke
 A life-threatening illness characterized by high body temperature and central nervous system dysfunction.





Children may be more susceptible to heat exhaustion because they have a smaller plasma pool from which to draw fluid. Thus, they have a potential greater deficiency of peripheral blood supply during strenuous activity in the heat than adults (

Zwiren, 1992

).




Individuals suffering from heat exhaustion should be moved to a cool place, given fluids, and encouraged to lie down. In severe cases of heat exhaustion, a person may require medical intervention including the intravenous administration of fluids and electrolytes.




Exertional heat injury
 is a moderate to severe progressive multisystem disorder, with hyperthermia accompanied by organ damage or severe dysfunction. Muscle cell breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) occurs when heat decomposes the muscle cell membrane, which in turn may cause liver and kidney damages (

Carter et al., 2006

;
 
Gardner and Kark, 2001

). Rhabdomyolysis is associated with and possibly caused by excessive repetitive exercise, especially eccentric exercise. Heat stress and dehydration exacerbate this condition (

Szczepanik et al., 2014

). Exertional heat injury is more severe than heat exhaustion but less severe than heatstroke. Exertional heat injury may progress into heatstroke, however.




Exertional heatstroke
 is a life-threatening illness characterized by central nervous system dysfunction (

Carter et al., 2006

;
 
Leon and Helwig, 2010

) and has become the third leading cause of death in high school athletes (

Allen & Cross, 2014

). Heatstroke is a progressive multisystem disease that can lead to death due to multiorgan failure (

Leon and Helwig, 2010

). It often involves severe muscle and liver cell deaths, cardiovascular collapse, and seizures (

Gardner and Kark, 2001

). It can be accompanied by elevated skin and core temperatures in excess of 40.5°C, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), vomiting, diarrhea, hallucinations, and coma. Heatstroke involves a failure of the thermoregulatory mechanisms. If heatstroke is suspected, the individual should be cooled as quickly as possible (preferably by cold water immersion) and medical personnel notified immediately. Unfortunately, a recent study found that although athletic trainers know that cold water immersion is the most effective way to treat this condition, only about half (49.7%) of those surveyed have adopted this method of cooling for their cooling treatment in cases of suspected heatstroke (

Mazerolle et al., 2010

).Complete the Check Your Comprehension 1–Case Study 1 to determine your understanding of exertional heat illness.

Prevention of Exertional Heat Illness


Although exercise professionals must be able to recognize and respond to heat illness, preferably they should prevent heat injuries by using sound judgment and observing basic recommendations. The ACSM position stand entitled “The Prevention of Thermal Injuries During Distance Running” (1987) outlines strategies to decrease thermal injuries during road races. Following are basic recommendations for people who exercise in hot environments:



1.
 Allow adequate time for acclimatization (10–14 days).




2.
 Exercise during cooler parts of the day (early morning or evening).




3.
 Limit or defer exercise if the heat index is in the high-risk zone (see
 
Figure 14.1

).




4.
 Adequately hydrate before exercise and replace fluid loss during exercise. Monitor daily body weight changes closely, because they reflect acute water loss.




5.
 Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing that exposes large areas of skin to the air to enhance evaporation.Complete the Check your Comprehension 2 scenario to test your understanding strategies to prevent heat illnesses.







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Working under Environmental Extremes






Many occupational workers, such as construction workers, miners, and hazardous material crews, are routinely required to perform muscular work under extreme environmental conditions. Probably no workers are exposed to higher thermal environments than are firefighters. Firefighters produce large amounts of metabolic heat and are often exposed to very high temperatures. Firefighters wear vapor-impermeable gear weighing approximately 20 kg and perform heavy muscular work, often in temperatures ranging from 100 to 400°C. Thus, it is not surprising that firefighters experience severe cardiac strain. In fact, the leading cause of death in the line of duty among firefighters is myocardial infarction. It accounts for approximately 50% of the line-of-duty deaths each year—far more than deaths due to burn injuries (<10% in most years).







To better understand the magnitude of the cardiovascular stress,
 
Smith et al. (2001)

 had firefighters perform three trials of a standardized set of firefighting tasks in a training building that contained live fires. Each set of drills took approximately 7 minutes to complete. A 10-minute rest period was provided between the second and third trials, during which firefighters removed their helmets, face masks, and coats in an attempt to cool the body and were strongly encouraged to consume cold water. As seen in the accompanying graphs, their heart rates increased quickly during the first trial and reached age-predicted maximal values by the end of the third trial. Stroke volume increased following the first trial but was significantly below resting values by the end of the third trial. Stroke volume was lower following several minutes of firefighting due to profuse sweating and vasodilation of cutaneous vessels. This occurred despite the attempt to cool the body and replace fluid during the 10-minute rest period.








Because of the severe cardiovascular strain associated with firefighting and the risk of myocardial infarction, many fire departments are initiating fitness programs for their personnel. Aerobic fitness programs help lessen the cardiovascular strain associated with firefighting by increasing plasma volume and improving heart function.

Exercise in the Cold




Cold weather can cause significant injuries to individuals who are unprepared or inadequately equipped for exercise training or competition. Although cold-related injuries are less common than heat-related injuries, they can be serious and even life threatening. Most commonly, exercise in the cold involves sporting events or wilderness experiences. Sporting events include winter sports, such as skiing and ice skating, and athletic contests, such as football. In these activities, hypothermia (low body temperature) is typically not a threat because individuals usually wear proper clothing, produce much metabolic heat, and have access to shelter when necessary. Wilderness activities, such as hiking and backpacking, present more risk because exposure can be prolonged (Figure 14.16
).









FIGURE 14.16
 Prolonged Activities in Cold Environments Can Pose a Risk of Hypothermia or Frost Bite
.




Exposure to cold results in several physiological responses that alter thermal balance. Heat production increases, and heat loss is minimized by vasoconstriction. Heat production increases through nonshivering thermogenesis, shivering thermogenesis, and exercise metabolism. Nonshivering thermogenesis
 refers to increased metabolic heat production other than through muscular contraction. Circulating hormones—catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and thyroxine—increase metabolic rate during cold exposure (Toner and McArdle, 1988
). Muscular tensing without noticeable shivering accounts for over 30% of the increase in heat production in response to cold exposure (Toner and McArdle, 1988
). This response is sometimes called preshivering. Shivering can also contribute significantly to heat production. Finally, although it varies with intensity and duration, exercise can be the greatest contributor to increased metabolic heat in the cold. Conversely, cool temperatures are often useful for dissipating the large amount of heat produced by exercise.



Very often, individuals who are exposed to the cold will voluntarily increase muscular activity as a means to increase heat production and thus feel more comfortable. Heat loss is minimized by widespread vasoconstriction, which decreases blood flow to the periphery in an attempt to maintain core temperature.




Despite the compensatory mechanisms, in some situations, being in a cold environment leads to heat loss that exceeds heat production, and body temperature drops. When an individual is exposed to the cold and heat loss is greater than heat production, serious injuries can result. The two most common cold-induced injuries of concern to exercise professionals are hypothermia and frostbite.



Cold-Induced Injuries



Hypothermia
, defined as a core temperature less than 35°C (95°F), is a lowering of the body temperature to the point that it affects normal function (Bar-Or and Baranowski, 1994
). This condition is potentially fatal. Body temperature drops when heat loss exceeds heat production. The magnitude of heat loss is affected by temperature, wind speed, and whether the individual becomes wet. The windchill chart (Table 14.1
) takes into account the combined effects of temperature and wind speed and should be consulted before activity in the cold.





Hypothermia
 A core temperature less than 35°C (95°F), resulting in the loss of normal function.





Because heat production increases greatly during exercise, hypothermia is seldom a concern for an exerciser who is properly clothed and not exposed to the environment for a prolonged time. However, during long-term events, such as a marathon, hypothermia may occur as a result of reduced heat production and increased heat loss. For instance, many runners run the second half of a race at a slower pace, resulting in less heat production. At this time, the runner may also have removed some clothing because of greater heat production earlier in the run and may be wet due to accumulated sweat, thus increasing the rate of conductive and evaporative heat loss.




As body temperature decreases, physical signs of hypothermia can be observed. Early signs include depressed heart rate, respiration, and reflexes. Mild hypothermia is marked by a loss of judgment and reduced ability to reason. The person often complains of being cold and is focused on getting warm. As hypothermia progresses, fine motor skills are affected and speech may become slurred. Severe hypothermia is characterized by agitation and inappropriate behavior and may progress to unconsciousness and coma. Mild hypothermia can be managed by warming the individual with blankets and warm beverages. However, moderate and severe cases of hypothermia should be treated by medical personnel. It is important to replace wet clothing and to protect a person with hypothermia from wind so that additional heat from the body is not lost. Because a person suffering from hypothermia often has an impaired ability to reason, the person should not be left alone.




Frostbite results from water crystallization within tissues that causes cellular dehydration and leads to tissue destruction. Frostbite usually occurs in insufficiently insulated skin. Severe frostbite can cause permanent circulatory damage, potentially leading to a need for amputation. Moving quickly (such as when running, skiing, and cycling) can create a windchill condition that increases the likelihood of frostbite.



Prevention of Cold-Induced Injuries


Injury prevention is preferable to injury treatment. To avoid cold injuries, individuals should exercise in appropriate clothing. Windproof and water-repellent outer garments are necessary. Layering loose-fitting clothing is more advantageous than wearing a single layer of heavy, bulky clothes. Clothing next to the skin should be composed of a material that wicks moisture away from the skin. Cotton should not be worn next to the skin
 because it holds moisture, which will draw heat away from the body.



Exercisers should consider warming up indoors, but only to the point at which they begin to sweat, so that they are not wet when they go outside. If possible, runners should run against the wind first and return with the wind at their back. Exercisers should also avoid periods of decreased metabolic heat production unless they can compensate by adding clothing or leaving the cold environment. The cooldown period at the end of exercise is potentially dangerous because heat production has decreased although heat loss remains high. Additionally, the exerciser may be fatigued, which further exacerbates the condition. The exerciser should ideally cool down inside also. Exercising in cold environments, not just hot ones, results in water loses. There appears to be a blunted thirst response, so attention should be paid to fluid intake (

Mears, & Shirreffs, 2014

).

PREVENTING COLD INJURIES DURING EXERCISE






The American College of Sports Medicine has published a Position Statement titled “Prevention of Cold Injuries during Exercise” to increase the safety of individuals performing work or exercise in cold environments. The adjacent flowchart provides an overall strategy for identifying and managing potential threats to performance and safety in cold conditions.

Influence of Sex and Age on Cold Tolerance


Male-Female Differences


Body size and composition are important influences on an individual’s response to cold exposure. Body fat protects against heat loss and can thus be advantageous in the cold (Toner and McArdle, 1988
). Because women on average have a greater percentage of body fat than men, they may tolerate cold better
.


Children and Adolescents


Because children have a larger surface area per kilogram of body weight, they lose heat faster in the cold than adults (Falk, 1998
). As compensation, however, peripheral vasoconstriction occurs to a greater extent in children to protect core temperature. This reduced blood flow lowers skin temperature, however, and increases the risk of frostbite in the extremities (Bar-Or and Baranowski, 1994
). Children also cool faster in water than adults because of their relatively larger surface area and smaller amount of subcutaneous fat. Special attention should be given, therefore, when children are swimming on cool days or when water temperatures are cool.


Older Adults


Older adults have a greater risk of hypothermia due to blunted physiological and behavioral responses to the cold. In older adults, vasoconstriction to conserve heat is reduced from that in young adults. Because older adults also have a lower exercise capacity, they will become fatigued earlier when performing the same absolute workload. An older person is more likely to produce less heat (due to fatigue and discontinuing exercise) and may be less able to limit heat loss (due to reduced vasoconstriction), placing them at greater risk for hypothermia. Evidence suggests that older adults often have a blunted sensitivity to cold, such that they may be slower to make appropriate behavioral changes in a cold environment (ACSM, 2006
).




SUMMARY





1.
 Environmental conditions that affect human thermoregulation are ambient temperature (T
amb
), relative humidity, and wind speed. The heat index assesses the risk of thermal injury from measures of ambient temperature and relative humidity. The windchill index assesses the risk of cold-induced injury from wind speed and ambient temperature.




2.
 Body temperature results from a balance of heat gain and heat loss. Most heat gain results from the body’s metabolic heat production. Heat can be lost from the body through radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation.




3.
 Sweat evaporation is the primary defense against heat stress. For each liter of sweat vaporized, 580 kcal of heat energy is released.




4.
 The extent of heat exchange depends on the thermal gradient, relative humidity, air movement, degree of direct sunlight, and clothing worn.




5.
 Several interrelated problems challenge the cardiovascular system under hyperthermic conditions.




a.
 The skin and the muscles compete for blood flow.




b.
 Vasodilation in the cutaneous vessels effectively decreases venous return and thus stroke volume.




c.
 Adequate blood pressure must be maintained to perfuse the vital organs.




d. Plasma volume is reduced, contributing to reduced cardiac output.




6.
 An individual’s response to exercise in the heat is influenced by the degree of acclimatization, cardiovascular fitness, body composition, and hydration level.




7.
 Water balance is generally well maintained, but athletes need to pay particular attention to hydration before, during, and after exercise in the heat.




8.
 The response of males and females to exercise in a hot environment is similar, although males appear to have a greater sweat rate.




9.
 In children and adolescents, thermoregulation is slightly different from that in adults, and they may be at greater risk of heat stress when exercising in hot environments.




10.
 When the cardiovascular system cannot meet the body’s thermoregulatory and metabolic demands, heat illness ensues. Heat illness is a range of disorders that vary in intensity, complexity, and severity. Exertional heat illnesses include heat exhaustion, heat injury, and heatstroke.




11.
 During exercise in the cold, heat loss may exceed heat production, potentially resulting in serious injuries: hypothermia and frostbite.
