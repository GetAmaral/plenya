Introduction





The common denominator for all sports, exercise, and physical activity is muscle action. For muscles to be able to act, energy must be provided. The first link in the chain supplying a large portion of this energy is respiration, which provides oxygen to and removes carbon dioxide from the body. In reality, most of us take respiration for granted (we don’t have to think to do it), and we are unaware of it until something like hard exercise increases the sensation. Thus, it comes as quite a surprise to many exercise physiology students that respiration is relatively complex physiologically. In addition, there are a great many abbreviations used for the multitude of respiratory terms. The reader is referred to the two pages entitled “Commonly Used Symbols and Abbreviations” directly inside the front of the textbook as a quick reference to help keep these terms straight. In addition, summaries of the variables important for the major divisions of respiration (pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration) are provided at the end of the appropriate sections of text.



Although it is typical to think of respiration as being the same as breathing and/or ventilation, technically, it is not.
 
Figure 9.1

 presents an overview of respiration. The volume of air flowing into the lungs from the external environment through either the nose or the mouth is called
 pulmonary ventilation
. Ventilation is accomplished by breathing, the alternation of inspiration and expiration that causes the air to move. The actual exchange of the gases oxygen (O
2
) and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) between the lungs and the blood is known as
 external respiration
. At the cellular level, oxygen and carbon dioxide gases are again exchanged; this exchange is called
 internal respiration
. The cardiovascular system transports the gases between the sites of external and internal respiration.
 Cellular respiration
 is the utilization of oxygen by the cells to produce energy with carbon dioxide as a by-product. Cellular respiration includes both aerobic (with O
2
) and anaerobic (without O
2
) energy production and is discussed in
 
Chapter 2

. This chapter concentrates on pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration. Technically, the respiratory system is responsible for only pulmonary and external respiration, but its mission is not accomplished without internal respiration (

Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

).










FIGURE 9.1
 Overview of Respiration.
 Respiration consists of four separate processes. The first is pulmonary ventilation, in which air is moved into and out of the body. The second, external respiration, involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the blood. The third is internal respiration, which involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide at the cellular or tissue level. Finally, cellular respiration is the utilization of oxygen to produce energy, which also produces carbon dioxide as a by-product.

Structure of the Pulmonary System




The respiratory system consists of two major portions: (1) the conductive zone, which transports the air to the lungs, and (2) the respiratory zone, where gas exchange takes place.


The Conductive Zone


The basic structure of the conductive zone is shown in Figure 9.2
. The structures from the nose or mouth to the terminal bronchioles comprise the conductive zone
. The primary role of the conductive zone is to transport air. Because no exchange of gases takes place here, this zone is also called anatomical dead space
. As a general guideline, the amount of anatomical dead space can be estimated as 1 mL for each 1 lb of “ideal” body weight (Slonim and Hamilton, 1976
). Hence, a 130-lb female who is at her ideal weight has an estimated 130 mL of anatomical dead space. However, if this individual were to gain 20 lb, she would still have the same anatomical dead space and that estimate would remain at 130 mL. Anatomical dead space is important in determining the alveolar ventilation, as discussed later.









FIGURE 9.2
 Anatomy of the Pulmonary System.
 The pulmonary system is divided into two zones: the conductive zone transports air to the lungs and the respiratory zone where gas exchange takes place.





The second important role of the conductive zone is to warm and humidify the air. By the time the air reaches the lungs, it will be warmed to body temperature (normally ~37°C) and will be 99.5% saturated with water vapor. This protective mechanism helps maintain core body temperature and protects the lungs from injury (Slonim and Hamilton, 1976
). The warming and humidifying of air is easily accomplished over a wide range of environmental temperatures under resting conditions, when the volume of air transported is small and the air is inhaled through the nose. During heavy exercise, however, large volumes of air are inhaled primarily through the mouth, thus bypassing the warming and moisturizing sites of the nose and nasal cavity. As a result, the mouth and the throat may feel dry. If heavy exercise takes place in cold weather (especially at subzero temperatures), dryness increases and throat pain may be felt. These uncomfortable feelings are not a symptom of freezing of the lungs; rather, they are the result of the drying and cooling of the upper airway. The lower portions of the conductive zone still moisturize and warm the air sufficiently before it reaches the lungs. A scarf worn across the mouth will trap moisture and heat from the exhaled air and thereby decrease or eliminate the uncomfortable sensations.



The third role of the conductive zone is to filter the incoming air. The nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchial system are all lined with ciliated mucous membranes (

Figure 9.2

). These membranes with their hair-like projections trap impurities and foreign particles (particulates) that are inhaled. Both smoke and environmental air pollutants diminish ciliary activity and can ultimately destroy the cilia.



The Respiratory Zone


The respiratory zone
 consists of the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs (grape-like clusters), and the alveoli (Figure 9.2
). The alveoli are the actual site of gas exchange between the pulmonary system and the cardiovascular system. At birth, humans have about 24 million alveoli. This number increases to about 300 million by 8 years of age and remains constant until age 30, when it begins a gradual decline. Although each individual alveolus is small, only about 0.2 mm in diameter, collectively, the alveoli in a young adult have a total surface area of 50–100 m2
 (West, 2005
). This area would cover a badminton court or even a tennis court if flattened out. Despite this large surface area, the lungs weigh only about
 2.2 lb (1 kg). The volume of the respiratory zone is about 2.5–3.0 L·min−1
 (West, 2005
). The membrane between the alveoli and the capillaries is actually composed of five very thin layers, two of which are the endothelial cells of the alveoli and the capillaries. The endothelium of the alveoli produces a substance called surfactant that reduces surface tension and helps prevent alveoli from collapsing (Seifter et al., 2005
). Despite the number of layers, the thickness is less than the paper this book is printed on, and gas exchange takes place easily (West, 2005
).



In addition to the anatomical dead space where no exchange takes place, some alveoli have no capillary blood supply or the capillaries are pathologically blocked and therefore cannot participate in gas exchange; these alveoli make up an
 alveolar dead space
. The anatomical plus the alveolar dead space combined makes up the
 physiological dead
 space. Because alveolar dead space is minimal in healthy individuals, the physiological dead space is only slightly larger than the anatomical dead space (

West, 2005

).





Mechanics of Breathing




The movement of air into the lungs from the atmosphere depends on two factors: pressure gradient (ΔP) and resistance (R). The relationship between these factors is expressed by the equation for airflow
 (

):


9.1 




A
 pressure gradient
 is simply the difference between two pressures. Difference is represented by the Greek capital letter delta: ∆. The larger the differences in pressure, the larger the pressure gradient is. Gases—in this case, air, which is a mixture of gases—move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.




Resistance
 is the sum of the forces opposing the flow of the gases. About 20% of resistance to airflow is caused by tissue friction as the lungs move during inspiration and expiration. The remaining 80% is due to the friction between the gas molecules and the walls of the airway (airway resistance) and the internal friction between the gas molecules themselves (viscosity). Airway resistance is determined by the size of the airway and the smoothness or turbulence of the airflow.




As Equation
 
9.1

 shows, in order for air to flow, the pressure gradient must be greater than the resistance to the flow. Thus, for inspiration to take place, pressure must be higher in the atmosphere than in the lungs; for expiration, pressure in the alveoli of the lungs must be higher than in the atmosphere.
 
Figure 9.3

 shows how the inspiratory pressure gradient is created.










FIGURE 9.3
 Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressure Gradients. Inspiration and expiration are accomplished through pressure gradients. A.
 The respiratory musculature is relaxed, and the atmospheric pressure equals the chest cavity pressure, so no air movement occurs. B.
 The external intercostals and diaphragm contract, moving the ribs up and out and the diaphragm down, respectively. This muscle action enlarges the chest cavity laterally, anteroposteriorly, and downward, increasing the volume. Chest cavity pressure is therefore lower than atmospheric pressure, and air flows in. C.
 The inspiratory muscles relax, and the chest cavity recoils, creating a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. Air flows out. The respiratory cycle then begins again.








FOCUS ON APPLICATION






External Nasal Dilators






Originally intended as a sleep aid, the Breathe Right strip external nasal dilator (END) has been embraced by a broad range of exercisers, including professional athletes from football players to marathoners. This device is a flexible “spring-like” band worn externally over the bridge of the nose as in the accompanying photo. It has been shown to increase nasal valve area and to decrease air resistance in the nasal cavity (Gehring, 2000; Portugal et al., 1997
). The question is whether this larger area and decreased resistance result in a higher tidal volume (VT
), lower frequency of breathing (f), or changes in minute ventilation—the amount of air exhaled each minute (

). Such changes, in turn, could result in a reduction in the respiratory muscle work (less oxygen consumption, 

) and ultimately a better athletic performance or faster recovery from exercise.







Experimental studies provide at least a partial answer. In each of the first four experiments, participants underwent three trials: control (C), normal breathing; placebo (P), wearing an inoperable END; and experimental (E), wearing an active functioning END.






1.
 
O’Kroy et al. (2001)

 tested 14 untrained college students during randomly assigned C, P, and E trials. An esophageal balloon measured the inspiratory elastic work, the inspiratory resistive work, and the expiratory resistive work.
 

,
 

, V
T
, and f of breathing were also monitored. No significant differences were found in any variable either at submaximal (70%
 

) or at maximal work.




2.
 In another study (

O’Kroy, 2000

), 15 participants performed three incremental exercise tests to volitional fatigue on a cycle ergometer. Maximal power output (a performance variable) was not significantly different among the three trials (C = 256 ± 73 W, P = 255 ± 70 W, and E = 257 ± 74 W). Neither the total body perception of effort nor the perceived effort of breathing differed among these trials.




3.
 In a series of field tests of maximal performance,
 
Macfarlane and Fong (2004)

 studied 30 male adolescents in a short-term anaerobic power test (40-m sprint), a long-term anaerobic power test (shuttle sprint), and an incremental aerobic test (20-m shuttle/PACER) under C, P, and E conditions. The rate of perceived breathing effort was significantly reduced in the long anaerobic tests and aerobic tests in the E trial over the C trial but not the P trial. No significant differences were seen in the actual performances of either anaerobic test. In the 20-m shuttle aerobic test, performance was improved in the E condition 3.2% over the C trial and 2.9% over the P trial, but no change occurred in the perception of breathing effort.




4.
 
Thomas et al. (2001)

 examined the effect of END on recovery from an anaerobic treadmill test under C, P, and E conditions. No differences were found for recovery in heart rate,
 

, or
 

.






In a fifth study, three separate groups of females participated: a sedentary group, preseason college athletes, and in-season college rowers. Each individual performed two incremental exercise tests, one with and one without an END. No significant differences were found in blood lactate concentration at the lactate threshold in any group. Thus, there was no improvement in either the exercise intensity at the lactate threshold or lower blood lactate levels during moderate- to high-intensity exercise (

Boggs et al., 2008

).








These combined experimental results indicate that the work of breathing, anaerobic performance, and recovery from anaerobic performance are not changed by wearing an END. In the one study showing an improvement in incremental aerobic and a decrease in perception of breathing effort, the changes were minimal. Based on these studies, the use of nasal dilators during exercise does not appear to be warranted.

A key to understanding
 
Figure 9.3

 is Boyle’s law.
 Boyle’s law
 states that the pressure of a gas is inversely related to its volume (or vice versa) under conditions of constant temperature: low pressure is associated with large volume, and high pressure is associated with small volume.




For pulmonary ventilation, an increase in chest cavity volume is accomplished by muscle contraction for inspiration. This increase in volume leads to an internal lung pressure decrease according to Boyle’s law. As a result, a negative pressure exists in the chest cavity relative to the atmosphere outside the body. Thus, a pressure gradient has been created. Air flows into the chest cavity in an attempt to equalize this pressure difference. The volume change per unit of pressure is called
 compliance
 (

West, 2005

). Healthy lungs tend to have high compliance that, in turn, favors efficient ventilation.




The main inspiratory muscle is the dome-shaped diaphragm. With neural stimulation, the diaphragm

 contracts and moves downward, elongating the chest cavity (

Figure 9.3B

). In normal resting breathing, the diaphragm moves about 1 cm; in heavy or forced breathing, it may move as much as 10 cm (

West, 2005

). During exercise, the chest cavity is further enlarged by the action of the external intercostal muscles and others, known collectively as the accessory muscles, which elevate the rib cage and cause expansion both laterally (side to side) and anteroposteriorly (front to back). The extent of accessory muscle activity and the resultant drop in pressure depend on the depth of the inspiration.




These changes in the chest cavity volume transfer themselves to the lungs through the pleura. Pleurae are thin, double-layered membranes that line both the

 chest cavity (the inner surfaces of the thorax, sternum, ribs, vertebrae, and diaphragm) and the external lung surfaces. The portion covering the chest cavity is called the parietal pleura; the portion covering the external lung surfaces is called the visceral or pulmonary pleura. A fluid secreted by the pleura fills the space between the pleurae (the intrapleural space), allowing the lungs to glide smoothly over the chest cavity walls. It also causes the parietal and the pulmonary pleurae to adhere to each other in the same way that two pieces of glasses are held together by a thin film of water. Because of this adhesion, the lungs themselves move when muscle actions move the chest cavity (

Hall, 2016

;
 
Martin et al., 1979

).




During normal resting conditions, expiration occurs simply because the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles relax. When these muscles relax, both the lungs and the muscles, which are highly elastic, recoil to their original positions. This elastic recoil decreases lung volume and thus creates a pressure inside the chest cavity that is higher than the atmospheric pressure. As the chest cavity volume decreases, the intrathoracic pressure increases slightly above that of the atmosphere. The result is that the air moves out of the lungs into the atmosphere. The pressures equalize again, and the cycle repeats with the next inspiration. A complete respiratory cycle includes both inspiration and expiration.




During heavy breathing, as in exercise, expiration is an active process. The primary expiratory muscles are the abdominals and the internal intercostals. The abdominals (rectus abdominus, the obliques, and the transverse abdominus) push the abdominal organs—and hence the diaphragm—upward; the internal intercostals pull the ribs inward and down. This decrease in chest volume increases intrathoracic pressure more quickly than passive elastic recoil alone, and the air is forced out of the lungs faster.




The pleurae also serve a purpose during expiration. Pressure in the intrapleural space fluctuates with breathing in a way that parallels pressure within the lungs. However, the intrapleural pressure is always negative (~−4 mmHg) relative to the intrapulmonary (lung) pressure. This negative pressure protects the lungs from collapsing. If the intrapleural pressure were equal to the atmospheric pressure, the lungs would collapse at the end of expiration because of the elastic recoil.




Because muscle activity is involved during the respiratory cycle of inhalation and exhalation, energy is consumed. During rest, however, this energy consumption (restricted to inspiratory muscles) amounts to only 1–2% of the total body energy expenditure in nonsmokers (

Pardy et al., 1984

).





Respiratory Circulation




The lung has two different circulatory systems. Pulmonary circulation
 serves the external respiratory function, and bronchial circulation
 supplies the internal respiratory needs of the lung tissue (Figure 9.4
).









FIGURE 9.4
 Lung Circulatory Systems. Pulmonary circulation (A)
 serves the process of external respiration, picking up oxygen for and unloading carbon dioxide from the body as a whole at the alveoli. Bronchial circulation (B)
 serves the process of internal respiration, unloading oxygen to and picking up carbon dioxide from the lung tissue. Source

 Modified from Germann and Stanfield (2002).





The structure of the pulmonary circulation parallels the divisions of the structures in the conductive zone, branching in a tree-like manner called
 arborization
 (

Figure 9.5

). Arborization ends in a dense alveolar capillary network, blanketing most but not all alveoli. The capillary blood flow through this network is called
 perfusion of the lung
 (

Hall, 2016

;
 
West, 2005

).

Perfusion of the Lung
 Pulmonary circulation, especially capillary blood flow.



Minute Ventilation or Minute Volume (VI or VE)
 The amount of air inspired or expired each minute, or the pulmonary ventilation rate per minute; calculated as tidal volume times frequency of breathing.



Tidal Volume (VT)
 The amount of air that is inspired or expired in one breath.



Alveolar Ventilation (VA)
 The volume of air available for gas exchange; calculated as tidal volume minus dead space volume times frequency.





The pulmonary artery exits the right ventricle of the heart and gives rise to the capillary network in the lungs (

Figure 9.4A

). The pulmonary vein originates from this capillary network and enters the heart at the left atrium. As with pulmonary airflow and the rest of the circulatory system, blood flows through this circuit due to differences in pressure that produce a pressure gradient large enough to overcome resistance to the flow. Normal pulmonary artery blood pressure is low, only 25/10 mmHg, but venous pulmonary blood pressure is even lower, only 7 mmHg. Although this pressure gradient between the pulmonary artery and vein is not large, it is enough to bring about the blood flow. Because of the low gradient, however, gravity affects the pulmonary circulation more than the systemic or total body circulation. The lowest portion of the lungs, therefore, is perfused best. The portion of the lungs that is best perfused with blood is also ventilated best (

Hall, 2016

;
 
Leff and Schumacker, 1993

;
 
Martin et al., 1979

). Which portion it is varies with the body posture.




The bronchial circulation (

Figure 9.4B

) consists of relatively small systemic arteries that originate from the descending portion of the aorta, called the thoracic artery, travel through the lungs, and return as veins that empty into the pulmonary venous system. Thus, not all of the pulmonary venous blood is fully oxygenated (

Slonim and Hamilton, 1976

).





Minute Ventilation/Alveolar Ventilation




The amount of air inspired or the amount of air expired in 1 minute is known as minute ventilation or minute volume
. The most common units of measurement are liters per minute (L·min−1
) and milliliters per minute (mL·min−1
). Inspired minute ventilation is symbolized as 

, where V is volume, the “dot” indicates per unit of time, and the subscript upper case I stands for inspired. The symbol for expired ventilation, 

, indicates expired rather than inspired air.



Minute ventilation depends on
 tidal volume (V
T
)
, the amount of air inhaled or exhaled

 per breath, and the frequency (f) of breaths per minute (b·min
−1
)

.




The equation is:



9.2 




Milliliters per minute are then commonly converted to liters per minute by dividing by 1,000.




At rest, a normal young adult breathes at a frequency of 12–15 times per minute and has a tidal volume of 400–600 mL. Children ventilate at a much faster rate but with a smaller tidal volume.







Example






Compute 

 when f = 15 br·min−1
 and VT
 = 400 mL. You should set up and solve the equation as follows:















Because minute ventilation represents the total amount of air moved into or out of the lungs per minute, it includes the portion of air that fills the conduction zone. Thus, minute ventilation does not represent the amount of air that is available for gas exchange. The amount of air that is available for gas exchange is termed
 alveolar ventilation
 (or
 anatomical effective ventilation
). Alveolar ventilation (


) takes into account tidal volume (V
T
), dead space (V
D
), and the frequency (f) of breathing. The equation for calculating
 

 is:



9.3 




Typically, approximately 70% of
 

 reaches the alveoli for gas exchange. The ratio of anatomical dead space (V
D
) to tidal volume (V
T
) is abbreviated as V
D
/V
T
. This is not a mathematical constant because both factors can change. The dead space actually increases from some stretching of the respiratory passages as breathing becomes deeper and the deeper breathing increases the inspired volume of air. The increase in dead space is only a very small portion of the increase in the volume of air inspired.







Example






Calculate alveolar ventilation using the values of f and VT
 given in the previous example, for a female who is at her ideal weight of 130 lb. Also calculate the percent of 

 that is available for gas exchange. This problem becomes:











The percentage is 67.5% [(4,050 mL·min
−1
)/(6,000 mL·min
−1
)].











CHECK YOUR COMPREHENSION 1




Given two breathing patterns, A and B, in the accompanying table, calculate the alveolar ventilation.






On the basis of your calculations, is it better to breathe fast and shallowly or slowly and deeply?


Individuals learning the front crawl swimming stroke are often reluctant to exhale air while their faces are in the water. They then try to inhale more air when their faces are turned to the side or to both exhale and inhale in the short time available during the head turn. Why is this not an effective breathing technique?


What is the effect of using a snorkel on the dead space? What implication does this effect have for breathing through a snorkel?





Check your answers in Appendix C.








In summary, the major variable for pulmonary ventilation are minute ventilation (


 or
 

), dead space (V
D
), tidal volume (V
T
), frequency of breathing (f), and the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (V
D
/V
T
). Alveolar ventilation (


) is considered part of external respiration.




As with minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation can be calculated from either
 

 or
 

. The alveolar dead space is so negligible in normal healthy individuals that it does not need to be considered in these calculations.

Measurement of Lung Volumes




Lung volumes can be measured either statically or dynamically. Static lung volumes are anatomical measures, are independent of time, and thus do not measure flow. Dynamic lung volumes depend on time and measure both airflow and air volume.


Static Lung Volumes


Take as deep a breath as you can. At this point, your lungs contain the maximum amount of air they can hold. This amount of air is called total lung capacity (TLC)
. TLC can be divided into four volumes and three other capacities, as depicted in Figure 9.6
. Note that the four capacities are combinations of two or more volumes. All of these volumes and capacities have clinical significance, but only those important in the study of exercise physiology are discussed briefly here.









FIGURE 9.6
 Static Lung Volume Spirogram.
 TLC can be subdivided into four volumes (IRV, VT,
 ERV, and RV) and into three other capacities (IC, FRC, and VC). From the normal resting depth of inspiration and expiration (indicated by the wavy line moving up and down, respectively, in the box labeled VT
), both inspiration and expiration can be expanded into the IRV and ERV until all possible air is inhaled and exhaled (VC). The RV remains in the lungs at all times.







Total Lung Capacity (TLC)
 The greatest amount of air that the lungs can contain.



Residual Volume (RV)
 The amount of air left in the lungs following a maximal exhalation.



Vital Capacity (VC)
 The greatest amount of air that can be exhaled following a maximal inhalation.





As mentioned previously, tidal volume (V
T
) is the amount of air either inhaled or exhaled in a single breath. A normal V
T
 inflates the lungs to about half of the TLC when sitting erect or standing and only about a third when lying supine (

Slonim and Hamilton, 1976

). When the demand for energy increases during exercise, V
T
 increases by expanding into both the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) and expiratory reserve volume (ERV). Thus, the limits of vital capacity (VC = IRV + V
T
 + ERV) represent the absolute limit of the tidal volume increase during exercise.




Residual volume (RV)
 is the amount of air left in the lungs following a maximal exhalation. This leftover air is important because it allows for a continuous gas exchange between the alveoli and the capillaries between breaths. If all air were forced out of the lungs, no gas would be available for exchange. During exercise, when V
T
 expands, the functional residual capacity (FRC) helps maintain a smooth exchange, in the following way. The V
T
 can and does expand into both the IRV and the ERV, but it expands more into the IRV than the ERV, leaving a relatively large FRC intact. This large FRC dilutes the gas changes (the decrease in oxygen and increase in carbon dioxide) caused by the increased energy production and expenditure of exercise. By reducing fluctuation, the FRC stabilizes and smoothes the gas exchange.




Despite its beneficial physiological aspects, RV presents a measurement difficulty. When body composition is determined by hydrostatic (underwater) weighing (see
 
Chapter 7

), RV must be measured or estimated. Residual air makes the body more buoyant; if not accounted for, it would reduce the underwater weight. The less an individual weighs underwater, the higher the measured percentage of body fat. Thus, if RV were not accounted for, it would erroneously increase the measurement of fat. This is the most common reason for determining RV in exercise physiology. Sometimes, RV is estimated from VC; however, it is more accurate if measured directly either outside or inside the tank (

Wilmore, 1969

). RV

 is estimated as 24% of VC for males and 28% of VC for females.




Vital capacity (VC)
 is simply the largest amount of air that can be exhaled following a maximal inhalation. The common way of testing VC is to ask the individual to inhale maximally and then forcefully exhale all of the air as quickly as possible. Because the exhalation is forced, the designation forced vital capacity, FVC, is used.



Dynamic Lung Volumes


When volumes are measured at specified time intervals (usually 1 and 3 seconds) during a forced VC test, the name is changed to forced expiratory volume,
 specifically, FEV1
 and FEV3
. This provides information not only about the total volume of air moved but also the rate of flow. Normal healthy individuals should be able to exhale at least 80% of their FVC in 1 second; this measurement is labeled FEV1
. FEV1
 values below 65–70% indicate moderate to severe restriction to airflow (Adams, 1994
).



The second commonly measured dynamic lung volume is a test of ventilatory capacity called
 maximal voluntary ventilation
 (MVV). In this test, a timed maximal ventilation of either 12 or 15 seconds is recorded and then multiplied by 5 (if 12 seconds) or 4 (if 15 seconds) to extrapolate to the volume that could be ventilated in 1 minute. This value is usually higher than what can actually be achieved during exercise in untrained individuals, but it gives a rough estimate of exercise ventilation potential. Low values may reflect airway resistance and poorly conditioned or poorly functioning ventilatory muscles.




Both FEV and MVV tests are often used as screening tests before maximal exercise tests of oxygen consumption.



Spirometry


All of the lung volumes and capacities described previously—except for TLC, FRC, and RV—can be measured using a spirometer. Historically, most spirometers had an inverted container, called a bell that fit inside another container usually filled with water. When air is exhaled into the tube, the bell is pushed up; inhalation moves the bell down. In this way, the volumes of air inspired and expired can be measured, and the various volumes, capacities, and flow rates can be calculated. A spirometer that measures air volumes over water is called a wet spirometer. Newer dry spirometers are often digital and do not use water (Figure 9.7
). Spirometry measures can also be obtained by many metabolic carts that assess oxygen consumption (see Chapter 4
).









FIGURE 9.7
 A Spirometer.




Gas Dilution


TLC, FRC, and RV cannot be measured by simple spirometry because these involve air that cannot be exhaled voluntarily from the lungs. Thus, it is necessary to determine the volume of air that remains in the lungs. The most common technique for this measurement is gas dilution. One technique involves the dilution of an inert, insoluble, foreign gas such as helium (He). A second technique involves the dilution of medical grade oxygen and the measurement of nitrogen (N2
) and is called the nitrogen washout technique. In each case, the participant inhales a known volume of either helium or oxygen and then rebreathes the gas mixture. Helium ultimately equilibrates with the gases in the lungs and spirometer, and calculations are based on the dilution of the original helium mixture. Oxygen dilutes the original nitrogen concentration in the lungs, and calculations are based on these values.






FOCUS ON RESEARCH






The Relationship between Forced Expiratory Volume and Health






Evidence is mounting that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
) is related to health.







An epidemiological study by
 
Schunemann et al. (2000)

 explored the link between low values of FEV
1
 (expressed as a
 percentage of predicted FEV
1
 [FEV
1
%pred]) and mortality (death from all causes).








A randomly selected sample of 554 adult men and 641 adult women were part of a 29-year follow-up. During that time, 302 (54.5%) of the men and 278 (43.4%) of the women died. Only 39 of these deaths (29 males and 10 females) were directly attributed to respiratory disease. Nevertheless, pulmonary function was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality: Each 1% increase in FEV

%pred (pred = predicted) was associated with a 1–1.5% decrease in all-cause mortality. The risk of an early death for individuals scoring in the lowest quintile (≤80.2 FEV
1
%pred for males and ≤80.5 FEV
1
%pred for females) was approximately twice as great (2.24 for males and 1.81 for females) as the risk in the highest quintile (≥108.8 FEV
1
%pred for males and ≥113.6 FEV
1
%pred for females).








The reasons for these results are unknown. It was initially thought that FEV
1
%pred was simply a proxy for smoking status, but other research has shown that this association is independent of smoking status. Possible explanations for the association include the following:






1.
 Impaired pulmonary function could lead to a decreased tolerance against environmental toxins.




2.
 Oxidative stress (see the Focus on Application box in
 
Chapter 5

 for a discussion of oxidative stress), which is negatively related to FEV
1
%pred, could adversely affect the overall health status. Conversely, reduced pulmonary function could be an underlying factor responsible for increased oxidative stress.




3.
 Low FEV
1
 values may simply adversely affect physical activity patterns, such that inactivity is the true causal factor.






Exploring the idea of environmental toxins, a study by
 
Aronson et al. (2006)

 investigated whether a decline in lung function (defined as FEV
1
) in apparently healthy individuals was associated with systemic inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP). The immune system and inflammation are detailed in
 
Chapter 22

, but briefly, the lungs are a major location for immune cell function. During breathing and gas exchange, the lungs must protect themselves against a variety of infectious agents, noxious gases, and various particulates. (Look ahead to
 
Figure 9.12

 and note the macrophage immune cell.) Thus, the investigators speculated that lung function could indicate an immune response occurring, along with resultant low-grade inflammation, before any overt disease appeared. Participants were 1,131 individuals without known pulmonary disease. Median values for CRP by FEV
1
%pred are presented in the graph for smokers and nonsmokers. The lowest quartile (<93% FEV
1
pred) contained 96 individuals with below normal (defined as <80% FEV
1
pred) values. The association between CRP and FEV
1
 was highly significant and remained so even after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, metabolic abnormalities, and cardiorespiratory fitness level. These results indicate that systemic inflammation may be linked to early declines in pulmonary function.








These combined results may mean that FEV
1
 can be used as a convenient health assessment tool.

Standardization


The respiratory measurements detailed above are performed under ambient or atmospheric conditions. This means that the temperature measured is the temperature in the room or in the spirometer just before testing, and the pressure is the barometric pressure of the room. Because the air is exhaled from inside the human body, which is a wet environment, the air is saturated with water vapor. These measurements are therefore designated as ATPS
: ambient (A) temperature (T) and pressure (P) saturated (S). Because ATPS volumes vary by environmental conditions, they must be converted to standardized conditions for purposes of comparison and assessment. Standardization is based on the known effects of pressure, temperature, and water vapor on gas volumes. Figure 9.8
 illustrates these three effects, which are as follows:









FIGURE 9.8
 Effects of Pressure, Temperature, and Water Vapor on Air Volume.
 A.
 The volume of a given quantity of a gas is inversely related to the pressure exerted on it, if the temperature remains constant (Boyle’s law). B.
 The volume of a given quantity of gas is directly related to the temperature of the gas if the pressure remains constant (Charles’ law). C.
 The volume of a gas increases as the content of water vapor increases.





1.
 The volume of a given quantity of gas is inversely related to the pressure exerted on it when the temperature remains constant. This effect is described by Boyle’s law and was discussed previously in the section on the mechanics of breathing. As shown in
 
Figure 9.8A

, when pressure is reduced from 760 to 600 mmHg, 5 L of air expands to 6.3 L. The reverse is also true. If the pressure increases from 600 to

 760 mmHg, the volume is reduced from 6.3 to 5.0 L (

Slonim and Hamilton, 1976

;
 
West, 2005

).




2.
 The volume of a given quantity of gas is directly related to the temperature of the gas when the pressure remains constant. This relationship is described by
 Charles’ law
. As shown in
 
Figure 9.8B

, if the temperature is reduced from 37°C to 0°C, the volume of the gas is reduced from 5 to 4.4 L. The reverse is also true. If the temperature rises from 0°C to 37°C, the volume also rises from 4.4 to 5.0 L.




3.
 Water molecules evaporate into a gas, such as air, and are responsible for part of the pressure of that gas. The amount of pressure accounted for by the water vapor is related exponentially to temperature. As shown in
 
Figure 9.8C

, when a volume of air is converted from saturated to dry air at a constant temperature, the volume is reduced from 5.0 to 4.7 L. Once again, the reverse is also true. If a gas volume goes from dry to wet at a given temperature, the volume increases (

Slonim and Hamilton, 1976

;
 
West, 2005

)

.



The numbers for temperature and pressure in Figure 9.8
 were not chosen arbitrarily. They are involved in the two standardized conditions to which ATPS lung volumes are converted: BTPS and STPD. The abbreviation BTPS
 means body (B) temperature (T) (37°C), ambient pressure (P), and fully saturated (S) with water vapor. Remember that in its passage through the conduction zone, the air is both warmed and humidified to achieve these values. When converting from ATPS to BTPS, the temperature increases and the pressure, adjusted for the effects of temperature on water vapor pressure, decreases. Because of Charles’ law (an increase in temperature causes an increase in volume) and Boyle’s law (a decrease in pressure causes an increase in volume), the volume expressed as BTPS has to be larger than the volume originally measured as ATPS.



BTPS is typically used when the anatomical space from which the volume of gas originated is of primary importance. Thus, most lung volumes and capacities are conventionally expressed as BTPS.




STPD
 means standard (S) temperature (T) (0°) and pressure (P) (760 mmHg), dry (D). The STPD volume is smaller than the originally measured ATPS volume because under typical testing conditions, temperature decreases from ATPS (~20°C) to STPD (0°C) and, by Charles’ law, so does volume. Unless the testing is done at sea level, pressure increases from ATPS (variable, but around 735–745 mmHg before considering the influence of water vapor) to STPD (760 mmHg), and according to Boyle’s law, volume decreases. Going from wet to dry conditions also decreases the volume.




STPD volumes are used when it is necessary to know the amount of gas molecules present. Inspired or expired minute ventilation is typically converted and reported in STPD conditions, although sometimes it may be expressed as BTPS.





Partial Pressure of a Gas: Dalton’s Law




Dry, unpolluted atmospheric air is a mixture of gases including oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, and krypton. Because the last three are considered inert in humans, they are generally grouped together and labeled simply as nitrogen (the largest component). Thus, air is said to be composed of 79.04% nitrogen, 20.93% oxygen, and 0.03% carbon dioxide. These percentages are also referred to as fractions of each gas and are given in decimal form: 0.7904 nitrogen, 0.2093 oxygen, and 0.0003 carbon dioxide. Another way to describe the composition of a gas mixture such as air is by the partial pressures exerted by each gas (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
).



All gases exert pressure. In a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the pressure of individual gases making up the mixture. Total pressure is standardized to the sea-level barometric pressure of 760 mmHg, but at altitudes above sea level, the actual barometric pressure, P
B
, must be used. The
 partial pressure of a gas (P
G
)
 is that portion of the total pressure exerted by any single gas in the mixture. The partial pressure of any gas is proportional to its percentage in the total gas mixture. These relationships are described by
 Dalton’s law of partial pressures
.






Partial Pressure of a Gas (PG)
 The pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture; determined by multiplying the fraction of the gas by the total barometric pressure.





The partial pressure of any gas is the product of the total pressure and the fraction of the gas (expressed as a decimal).



9.4 



For example, the standardized partial pressure of nitrogen, PN2
, is 760 mmHg × 0.7904 = 600.7 mmHg.



Substituting the appropriate fractions, calculate the PO
2
 and PCO
2
 of dry atmospheric air.
 
Table 9.1

, column (a), shows the answers. For extra practice, also calculate the partial pressure of dry atmospheric air at altitude and of alveolar air. Look first at
 
Table 9.1

, columns (a) and (b). Notice that the gas percentages are the same at sea level and at altitude, in this case 4,268 m (14,000 ft). These percentages remain the same at any altitude. Conversely, the barometric pressure (P
B
) is lower at both the selected altitude and any other altitude in comparison with sea level. Exactly how much lower than sea level the P
B
 is depends on how high the altitude is. At 4,268 m (14,000 ft), P
B
 is 440 mmHg. As the altitude increases, the barometric pressure decreases. Now, compare
 
Table 9.1

, columns (a) and (c). Notice that now the barometric pressure values are the same; that is, they are both standardized to 760 mmHg. However, the fractions of the gases are different. This difference between alveolar air and atmospheric air occurs because the percentage of oxygen in the alveoli is decreased by diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood. Similarly, the percentage of carbon dioxide is increased by the diffusion of carbon dioxide out of the capillary blood. In addition, water vapor now occupies a percentage of the total air mixture. At normal body temperature (37°C), water vapor exerts a pressure of 47 mmHg. This value must be subtracted from 760 mmHg prior to multiplying by the fraction of each gas to determine the partial pressure of each gas.

 Approximate Gas Partial Pressures in Ambient Air and Selected Ventilatory and Respiratory Sites

Owing to minor variations in percentage, the PO2

Knowledge of the partial pressure of gases is important for at least two reasons. The first is that the partial pressures of oxygen (PO
2
) in the blood and more specifically the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO
2
) help to regulate pulmonary ventilation to bring air into the lungs. The PO
2
 and PCO
2
 are sensed by various chemoreceptors and influence respiratory centers in the brain (see full discussion later in this chapter). The second reason is that both external and internal respirations depend on pressure gradients.





Regulation of Pulmonary Ventilation




Breathing, or pulmonary ventilation, results from inspiratory and expiratory muscle contraction and relaxation. The muscle action—and therefore the rate, depth, and rhythm of breathing—is controlled by the brain and nervous system and is tightly coupled to the body’s overall need for oxygen and the subsequent production of energy and carbon dioxide. The coordinated control of respiratory muscles, especially during exercise, is a very complex process that is not yet fully understood.


The Respiratory Centers


There are two main regions in the brain that function together to control breathing: the pons and the medulla. These are schematically diagrammed in the middle of Figure 9.9
.









FIGURE 9.9
 Anatomical Sensors and Factors That Influence the Control of Pulmonary Ventilation.
 Schematic representation of the respiratory centers that control ventilation and the pathways of action of factors influencing the control of ventilation.





Within the medulla oblongata of the brainstem are two respiratory centers composed of anatomically distinct neural networks. The ventral respiratory group (VRG) is the rhythm-generating and integrative center. It contains neurons that fire during inspiration and other neurons that fire during expiration. Each group inhibits the other. When the inspiratory neurons fire, nerve impulses traveling via motor neurons stimulate the diaphragm and the external intercostal inspiratory muscles to contract. Inhalation occurs when the thoracic cavity is enlarged and intrathoracic pressure decreases. When the VRG’s expiratory neurons fire, the motor nerve output stops, the inspiratory muscles relax, and exhalation occurs. Active contraction of the expiratory muscles (internal intercostals and abdominals) occurs when forceful breathing is required, such as during moderate to heavy exercise (

Leff and Schumacker, 1993

;
 
West, 2005

).




Without outside influence and at rest, the VRG center causes a
 respiratory cycle
 of approximately 2 seconds for inspiration and 3 seconds for exhalation (for a rate of 12–15 br·min
−1
). This normal respiratory rate and oscillating rhythm is known as
 eupnea
.

The dorsal respiratory group DRG until recently was thought to act as an inspiratory center. However, it now appears as if the DRG integrates input from peripheral stretch receptors and chemoreceptors and communicates this information to the VRG (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
; Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
). The pons area of the brainstem contains pontine respiratory centers. They seem to be important for ensuring that the transitions between inhalation and exhalation are smooth. The pontine respiratory centers transmit impulses to the VRG of the medulla to fine tune breathing rhythms generated by the VRG during such specialized activity as exercise. Inspiratory depth is determined by how actively the respiratory centers stimulate the motor neurons serving the respiratory muscles; this is achieved by varying the number of motor units stimulated. Respiratory rate is determined by how long the stimulation lasts (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
).


Anatomical Sensors and Factors Affecting Control of Pulmonary Ventilation


The respiratory centers are influenced by a number of factors through a variety of anatomical sensors that are important during exercise (Dempsey et al., 1985
).




Figure 9.9

 includes these factors and schematically presents the major areas where each factor operates. Without outside influences, the rate (frequency) of breathing and the depth (tidal volume) of breathing exhibit the greatest changes. A disruption in rhythm rarely occurs except under voluntary control (

Hall, 2016

;
 
Leff and Schumacker, 1993

;
 
Whipp et al., 1982

)

.



Higher Brain Centers


Both the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex can influence breathing. The first operates involuntarily and the second voluntarily.


HYPOTHALAMUS The sympathetic nervous system centers in the hypothalamus are activated by pain or strong emotions. In turn, they send neural messages to the respiratory centers. The reaction can either stimulate or inhibit breathing. Hyperventilation by an individual who is emotionally upset is an example of hypothalamic stimulation. Feeling your breath taken away when you jump into very cold water exemplifies hypothalamic inhibition. This hypothalamic control mechanism may be very important for increasing respiration on initiation of movement and sustaining the increase throughout the duration of an activity (Eldridge, 1994
).


Cerebral Cortex Cerebral control of breathing originates in the motor cortex. Such voluntary control is important to musicians, singers, and athletes such as swimmers, weight lifters, archers, and shooters, to name just a few. The motor cortex may also operate such that the conscious anticipation of exercise unconsciously increases ventilation. Neural impulses from the motor cortex pass directly to the respiratory muscles, bypassing the control centers in the medulla. Voluntary control is limited, however (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
; West, 2005
). If you doubt this, take a reading break at the end of this paragraph and jog in place at a fast pace for 3 minutes. Then sit down immediately and try holding your breath for 1 minute. If you can do that, great; but even if you can, you will probably feel a desire to breathe. More than likely, the automatic drive to breathe will overrule your conscious signal not to, and at some point before the end of the minute, you will gasp for air.


Systemic Receptors


The lungs themselves contain several types of receptors that provide sensory information to the respiratory control centers and result in reflex action. Chief among them are irritant receptors and stretch receptors (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
; Martin et al., 1979
; West, 2005
). Both of these receptors are more important for protection than for regulating normal resting or exercise ventilation.


IRRITANT RECEPTORS Irritant receptors within the conduction zone respond to foreign substances such as chemicals, noxious gases, cold air, mucus, dust, and other pollutant particulates. They cause a reflex response. Depending on the irritating substance and the anatomical location, the response may be a cough, a sneeze, or a bronchial constriction, all of which disrupt the normal breathing pattern (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
; West, 2005
).


Stretch Receptors Stretch receptors in the airway smooth muscle respond to deep, fast inflation. Increases in the lung volume stimulate the stretch receptors, which send inhibitory impulses to the medullary respiratory centers. As a result, respiratory frequency is slowed because of the increased expiratory time (inflation reflex). An opposing deflation reflex tends to increase inspiratory activity. These reflexes are called the Hering-Breuer reflexes.
 The threshold for these is quite high. They do not appear to function in adults at rest and play a minor role in exercise only if tidal volume exceeds 1 L (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
; West, 2005
).


Mechanoreceptors


Specific mechanoreceptors called proprioceptors exist in skeletal muscles (including respiratory muscles) and joint capsules. These receptors provide information to a variety of sites in the brain about movement and body position in space. Input from these receptors probably plays some minor role in the stimulation of respiration during exercise, but they are not involved in respiration during rest (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
).


Chemoreceptors


Chemoreceptor sensors that respond to fluctuations in chemical substances important to respiration are found in two major anatomical locations. Central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla oblongata; these are sensitive to an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (↑PCO2
) and increased acidity (↓pH). Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in large arteries, specifically, at the aortic body and the carotid body. In addition to being sensitive to ↑PCO2
 and ↓pH, these receptors are also sensitive to a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen (↓PO2
) and an increase in the concentration of potassium ions (↑[K+
]). Each of these factors is explained in the following subsections.


INFLUENCE OF PO2 The peripheral carotid body chemoreceptors are the main oxygen sensors. Under normal circumstances, a decline in PO2
 has very little impact on minute ventilation other than enhancing sensitivity to PCO2
 (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
).




Figure 9.10

 shows that from the normal arterial PO
2
 (PaO
2
) of 95 mmHg (

Table 9.1

) to a value of about 60 mmHg, minute ventilation does not change if the arterial PCO
2
 (PaCO
2
) remains normal (~36 to 42 mmHg). However, if the PaO
2
 decreases below 50 mmHg, minute ventilation is stimulated to rise exponentially. Such a large decrease is not a normal physiological event at sea level, even at very heavy levels of exercise, because the PaO
2
 mmHg is maintained within narrow limits. However, PaO
2
 may fall below 50 mmHg at altitudes above 4,268 m (14,000 ft), triggering the graphically depicted increase in minute ventilation (

Leff and Schumacker, 1993

;
 
West, 2005

).










FIGURE 9.10
 The Effect of Arterial PO
2
 (PaO
2
) on Minute Ventilation.

 of 36–42 mmHg, reduced PaO2
 does not stimulate ventilation until the value of PaO2
 is less than 60 mmHg. Source

INFLUENCE OF PCO2 Both the central and the peripheral chemoreceptors are sensitive to an increase in the PaCO2
. However, the peripheral chemoreceptors respond more directly to PCO2
 than the central
 chemoreceptors do. The central chemoreceptors respond initially to rising PCO2
 levels but thereafter primarily to the effect these rising PCO2
 levels have on pH. The ventilatory response to PCO2
 is split 40–60% between peripheral and central chemoreceptors, respectively. At rest, the regulation of pH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the primary control mechanism (by the central receptors) of ventilation.




Figure 9.11

 shows the influence of increasing arterial PCO
2
 values on minute ventilation. Even a small deviation from the normal value of PaCO
2
 of approximately 40 mmHg (

Table 9.1

) causes a large rectilinear increase in minute ventilation when arterial PO
2
 is maintained at approximately normal levels (~95 mmHg). The steepness and the immediacy of this rectilinear increase indicate that ventilation is much more sensitive to an increase in PCO
2
 than to a decrease in PO
2
. Hence, PaCO
2
 is the strongest regulating factor. An increase as small as 5 mmHg in PaCO
2
 increases ventilation by approximately 67%. The ventilatory response to CO
2
 is reduced in sleep, with increasing age, in trained athletes, and in underwater divers (

West, 2005

).










FIGURE 9.11
 The Ventilatory Response to Carbon Dioxide. At a normal PA
O2
 of approximately 100 mmHg, a rise in PaCO2
 from the normal value of 40 mmHg to just 45 mmHg almost doubles pulmonary ventilation (from ~15 to 26 L·min−1
, as indicated by the dashed lines intersecting the y-axis), showing how sensitive ventilation is to PaCO2

Holding your breath will cause an increase in the arterial PCO
2
, called
 hypercapnia
. Sometimes, an excess of CO
2
 in the blood can lead to labored or difficult ventilation, which is termed
 dyspnea
. Excess CO
2
 is not the only possible cause of dyspnea, and this is not a normal exercise response. A buildup of CO
2
 is the reason your conscious control of respiration was overruled if you tried not to breathe after the 3-minute jog in place earlier. Conversely,
 hyperventilation
—defined as increased pulmonary ventilation, especially ventilation that exceeds metabolic requirements—decreases PCO
2
 (called
 hypocapnia
) and the drive to breathe. Hyperventilation may be caused by an altitude response to a decreased PO
2
, an involuntary response during an anxiety attack, or a conscious attempt to extend breath-holding time.






Dyspnea
 Labored or difficult breathing.



Hyperventilation
 Increased pulmonary ventilation, especially ventilation that exceeds metabolic requirements; carbon dioxide is blown off, leading to a decrease in its partial pressure in arterial blood.



Hyperpnea
 Increased pulmonary ventilation that matches an increased metabolic demand, such as during exercise.



Diffusion
 The tendency of gaseous, liquid, or solid molecules to move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration by constant random action.




INFLUENCE OF PH As with an increase in arterial PCO2
, both the peripheral and the central chemoreceptors are sensitive to the decreases in pH. The pH level is partially related to the CO2
 level. When CO2
 is hydrated, it forms carbonic acid (H2
CO3
), which degrades readily into hydrogen ions (H+
) and bicarbonate (HCO3
−
) according to the following reactions:







In blood, the H
+
 can be buffered, but if that capacity is exceeded, any change in arterial pH is detected by the aortic and carotid bodies. The brain and the spinal cord are bathed by a protein-free solution known as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CO
2
 easily diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and into the CSF. Because brain cells also produce CO
2
 and because CSF has no protein buffers, the pH of the CSF is slightly more acidic than

 that of blood. An excess of H
+
 in the CSF acts directly on the central chemoreceptors to increase respiration; a decrease in H
+
 suppresses respiration.




All changes in pH, of course, are not caused by CO
2
. For example, during high-intensity exercise, large quantities of lactate accumulate. If the blood’s ability to buffer the resultant H
+
 is exceeded, pH decreases, and respiration increases.






FOCUS ON APPLICATION:
 Clinically Relevant





Decreased PCO2
 and Drowning






The decrement in PCO2
 with hyperventilation can have serious consequences. Many people know that hyperventilating can extend breath-holding time but erroneously believe it does so because more oxygen is taken in. They are unaware that it is not O2
 but CO2
 levels that are changing (being blown off) and that respiration is more sensitive to PCO2
 changes than to PO2
 changes. Craig (1976)
 summarized 58 cases of loss of consciousness during underwater swimming and diving following hyperventilation. Of these 58 cases, 23 (40%) ended as fatalities, with most occurring in guarded pools. Because an individual continues patterned motor activity (swimming) for a short time after loss of consciousness caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, these life-threatening cases are difficult for a lifeguard to detect quickly. Beginning swimmers frustrated by trying to coordinate their arms, legs, and breathing who simply put their head in the water and try to go as far as possible without breathing are also vulnerable. As a result of these findings, it is recommended that underwater swimming be limited to one length of a standard 25-yd or 25-m pool.

INFLUENCE OF [K+] Of the chemical factors mentioned so far (↓PO2
, ↑PCO2
, and ↓pH), only ↓pH changes enough during exercise to cause the needed increase in ventilation known as hyperpnea. Hyperpnea
 is increased pulmonary ventilation that matches an increased metabolic demand. An increase in the concentration of potassium [K+
] may be another factor that changes sufficiently in exercise to increase ventilation. Potassium moves from the working muscles to blood during exercise of any intensity. This increased [K+
], called hyperkalemia
, directly stimulates the carotid bodies. At rest, [K+
] is not a factor (Eldridge, 1994
; Forster and Pau, 1994
; Nye, 1994
).




Figure 9.9

 earlier schematically depicted factors that control the rate and depth of ventilation. It would be logical to assume that changes in the arterial PO
2
 and PCO
2
 occur during exercise and have the primary role in control. However, this is not what happens. Neither PO
2
 nor PCO
2
 changes enough, especially early in exercise or at low to moderate to heavy intensities in untrained individuals, to play a major role in ventilatory control during exercise. Exactly which factor is most important is not known precisely. Changes may take place in the sensitivity of the medullary respiratory control centers themselves during exercise. Neural messages from the motor cortex, muscle proprioceptors, and hypothalamic sympathetic nervous system activity, as well as increases in the hydrogen ion and potassium ion concentrations, all appear to have a role during exercise (

Eldridge, 1994

;
 
West, 2005

).





Gas Exchange and Transport




Gas Exchange: Henry’s Law


As mentioned previously, knowledge of the partial pressure of gases is important for two reasons. First, the partial pressures of gases play a role in the control of pulmonary ventilation, as discussed above. Second, the movement of O2
 and CO2
 between the alveoli and the capillaries (external respiration) and between the capillaries and the tissues (internal respiration) occurs by the process of diffusion. Diffusion
 is the tendency of gaseous, liquid, or solid molecules to move from an area of higher
 concentration to an area of lower concentration by constant random action. Diffusion can occur only if there is a pressure gradient (a difference in the partial pressures of the gas) between the capillary and the tissue. Gases diffuse down the pressure gradient from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure area. The rate of diffusion depends on the magnitude of the pressure gradient (millimeters of mercury at the high end minus millimeters of mercury at the low end), the surface area available for diffusion, the thickness of the barrier between the two locations, and the solubility (ability to be dissolved) of the gas in the barrier liquid. Henry’s law
 states that when a mixture of gases is in contact with a liquid, each gas dissolves in the liquid in proportion to its partial pressure and solubility until equilibrium is achieved and the gas partial pressures are equal in both locations (Leff and Schumacker, 1993
; Martin et al., 1979
).


External Respiration


External respiration is the movement of gases at the alveolar-pulmonary capillary level (Figure 9.12
). Specifically, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the pulmonary capillary into the alveoli. This exchange is diagrammed in Figure 9.13A and D
.









FIGURE 9.13
 Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Exchange.
 Gas exchange takes place at two anatomical locations: the alveoli-pulmonary capillary interface (external respiration) and the systemic capillary-tissue interface (internal respiration). A.

Remember that pulmonary circulation originates from the right ventricle of the heart. By definition, an artery is a vessel carrying blood away from the heart. Unlike systemic arteries, the pulmonary artery carries partially deoxygenated blood. The pulmonary arteries quickly branch into capillaries that parallel the alveoli. While they are small, the capillaries do have a definable length

.




At the arterial end of the capillary, PO
2
 in the alveoli (P
A
O
2
) is high (98–104 mmHg) (

Table 9.1

), and PO
2
 in the pulmonary capillary is low (40 mmHg). Oxygen diffuses down the pressure gradient until equilibrium is reached at approximately 104 mmHg. Note in
 
Figure 9.13A

 that this equalization of pressure occurs within the first third of the capillary length. This means that blood can actually flow three times as fast through the pulmonary capillaries and still be adequately oxygenated.




Refer again to
 
Table 9.1

 and
 
Figure 9.13A and B

. In
 
Figure 9.13B

, notice that PaO
2
 (systemic arterial blood) is listed as 95 mmHg, not as 98–104 mmHg as given in
 
Table 9.1

 and
 
Figure 9.13A

. The lower value in the systemic arterial blood (95 mmHg) versus the venous pulmonary blood (104 mmHg) results because the fully oxygenated blood in the pulmonary vein is diluted with partially oxygenated venous blood (PvO
2
 = 40 mmHg) from the bronchial vein as blood from both the veins flows into the left atrium. Remember that the bronchial artery, the capillaries, and the vein provide blood to and return it from the lungs as part of the systemic circulation and so have the normal systemic gas contents and pressures (

Figure 9.4

). Although blood from the bronchial vein amounts to only about 2% of the total blood returning to the left atrium, it is sufficient to bring the PaO
2
 of systemic arterial blood down to approximately 95 mmHg (

Hall, 2016

).




At the same time that oxygen is diffusing from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries to the alveoli. At the arterial end of the capillary, PCO
2
 in the capillary is high (about 45 mmHg) and PCO
2
 in the alveoli is low (40 mmHg) (

Table 9.1

). Carbon dioxide also diffuses from high to low pressure down the gradient until equilibrium is reached. Note in
 
Figure 9.13D

 that this equalization of pressure occurs within the first third of the capillary length. Note also that the pressure gradient for CO
2
 is not nearly as steep (5 mmHg) as it is for O
2
 (64 mmHg). Carbon dioxide diffuses with a lesser pressure gradient because it is more soluble.




Remember that each gas moves down its own concentration gradient, regardless of the concentration of any other gas present.




The major variables that are important in external respiration are alveolar ventilation (


), the partial pressure of oxygen at the alveoli (P
A
O
2
), partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO
2
), oxygen or partial pressure of oxygen gradient between the alveoli and the arteries (A-a) PO
2
, the percent saturation of arterial blood with oxygen (SaO
2
%), and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the alveoli (P
A
CO
2
).



Internal Respiration


Internal respiration is the movement of gases at the capillary-tissue level. Although the tissue can be any tissue, it is particularly relevant for exercise physiology students to think of the tissue as skeletal muscle tissue. Internal respiration is diagrammed in Figure 9.13B and C
. Skeletal muscle fibers are well supplied with capillaries. When blood enters the arterial end of any systemic capillary, PaO2
 is high (95 mmHg). Within the tissue, PO2
 at rest is low (40 mmHg). Oxygen diffuses from high to low pressure until equilibrium is reached. Blood exiting into the systemic venous system thus has a PvO2
 of 40 mmHg, which is maintained until oxygenation occurs again at the alveoli.



Carbon dioxide is produced at the tissue level as a direct result of cellular respiration. Thus, PCO
2
 levels are higher (about 45 mmHg) in the tissues than elsewhere in the system. Diffusion occurs as always from the area of high pressure (45 mmHg in the tissue) to the area of low pressure (40 mmHg in the systemic capillary), once again achieving equilibrium. The venous level of PCO
2
 is also maintained until it reaches the alveoli, where the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the bloodstream and is exhaled. To make sure that you understand the movement of respiratory gases during rest, complete the task in the

Check your answer in Appendix C.








The respiratory variables that are important for internal respiration are the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO
2
), the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood (PvO
2
), the amount of oxygen carried in the arteries minus the amount carried in the veins (a-vO
2
diff), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO
2
), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in venous blood (PvCO
2
), and the percent saturation of venous blood with oxygen (SvO
2
%).



Oxygen Transport


Oxygen is carried in two ways in the blood. First, oxygen is transported in a dissolved form in the liquid portion of the blood. The amount of oxygen transported this way is only about 1.5–3% of the total oxygen transported. However, it is this dissolved component that is responsible for the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (Figure 9.13
). The dissolved oxygen content is determined by the PO2
 and the solubility of oxygen, which is a constant of 0.00304 mL·dL−1
·mmHg−1
 at 37°C. The formula is as follows (Hall, 2016
; Leff and Schumacker, 1993
)
:


9.5 







Example






In normal systemic arterial blood with a PaO2
 of 95 mmHg, the calculation becomes











Thus, only 0.29 mL of oxygen is dissolved in a deciliter of arterial blood. You may also see this result expressed in units of milliliters per 100 milliliters (mL·100 mL
−1
) of blood or as milliliters percent (mL %). All are comparable.








The second way oxygen is transported in the blood is bound to hemoglobin. The vast majority, 97–98.5%, of the oxygen in the bloodstream is transported this way.



Red Blood Cells and Hemoglobin


Red blood cells (RBCs), or erythrocytes, are small, flexible cells shaped like biconcave disks, or miniature doughnuts, with an area where the hole would be just squished in (Figure 9.14
). Females typically have an RBC count of 4.3–5.2 million per cubic milliliter of blood; the male count is generally 5.1–5.8 million per cubic milliliter of blood. The average person has about 35 trillion RBCs, which have a total surface area of about 2,000 times the body’s total surface area. Hemoglobin, which is the protein portion of the RBC that binds with oxygen, constitutes about one third of an RBC by weight if water is included or 97% if water is excluded. Normal values for hemoglobin for adult females are 12–16 g·100 mL−1
 blood (g·dL−1
), with a mean of 14 g·100 mL−1
 blood. For adult males, the values are 14–18 g·100 mL−1
 blood, with a mean of 16 g·100 mL−1
 blood. Children have slightly lower values (Hall, 2016
).

 .





Hemoglobin
 consists of four iron-containing pigments called
 hemes
 (

Figure 9.15

) and a protein called
 globin
. Each of the four iron atoms in a hemoglobin molecule can combine reversibly with one molecule of oxygen. Therefore, each hemoglobin molecule can transport four molecules of oxygen. The chemical symbol for hemoglobin is Hb. The chemical symbol for hemoglobin not bound to oxygen, sometimes called
 deoxyhemoglobin
 or reduced hemoglobin (negatively charged) such that it binds quickly and easily to H
+
 ions, is often designated as HHb. Hemoglobin bound to oxygen, symbolized HbO
2
, is called
 oxyhemoglobin.
 None of the oxygen bound to hemoglobin is used by the RBC.

Hemoglobin (Hb)
 The protein portion of the red blood cell that binds with oxygen, consisting of four iron-containing pigments called hemes and a protein called globin.



Percent Saturation of Hemoglobin (SbO2%)
 The ratio of the amount of hemoglobin combined with oxygen to the total hemoglobin capacity for combining with oxygen, expressed as a percentage; indicated generally as SbO2% or specifically as SaO2% for arterial blood or as SvO2% for venous blood.




The Binding of Oxygen with Hb: The Oxygen Dissociation Curve


All four oxygen molecules do not bind with the four heme atoms at the same time (Figure 9.16
). Figure 9.16A
 shows
 deoxyhemoglobin. Binding of one oxygen molecule onto a fully deoxygenated hemoglobin molecule (Figure 9.16B
) changes the spatial arrangement (conformation) of all of the other subunits (Figure 9.16C
). This change increases the binding affinity for oxygen. Thus, each succeeding oxygen molecule binds more easily and quickly than the preceding one (Figure 9.16D–F
) (Seifter et al., 2005
). The result is a fully oxygenated hemoglobin molecule (HbO2
). When graphed, this process of successive molecules of oxygen binding to hemoglobin produces the characteristic sigmoid-shaped curve of oxyhemoglobin shown in Figure 9.17
. This curve is called the oxygen dissociation curve
, for reasons that will become clear later.









FIGURE 9.16
 Oxygenation of Hemoglobin.
 A.
 Hemoglobin consists of four heme subunits tightly bonded to each other with a relatively low affinity for oxygen (O2
). B.
 Once oxygen binds to one heme subunit, the spatial arrangement (conformation) of all other subunits changes (C)
, increasing the affinity for oxygen. As a result, second (D)
, third (E)
, and fourth (F)
 oxygen molecules bind increasingly faster. This results in fully oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2
). Source

 Seifter et al. (2005). Used with permission.











FIGURE 9.17
 Oxygen Dissociation Curve.
 Under normal resting conditions, approximately 25% of the oxygen being transported in arterial blood is dissociated (released or exchanged by internal respiration) for use by body tissues. The shaded area at the top of the diagram represents this in percentage on the left y-axis and as an absolute amount on the right y-axis. See text for full explanation and calculations.





When all four of its heme groups are bound to oxygen, the hemoglobin molecule is said to be fully saturated. All hemoglobin molecules may not be fully saturated, though. The amount of the oxygen-carrying capacity being used at a given time is referred to as
 percent saturation of hemoglobin
, designated as SbO
2
%. Percent saturation is calculated as:



9.6 




The symbols SaO
2
% and SvO
2
% may be used to distinguish percent saturation of blood in the arteries and the veins, respectively, whereas Sb refers nonspecifically to blood.




Percent saturation depends primarily on the partial pressure of oxygen. In the arterial blood at a PO
2
 of 95 mmHg, the percent saturation is 97%. Find this value on
 
Figure 9.17

, where PO
2
 is on the x-axis and SbO
2
% is on the left y-axis. On the same figure, determine the SbO
2
% in normal venous blood. Since the PO
2
 in normal venous

 blood is 40 mmHg, you should have determined that the SbO
2
% was 75%. This value is also shown in
 
Figure 9.17

.




In addition to knowing the % saturation of blood with oxygen, it is also useful to know how much oxygen is carried in the blood. The
 oxygen content
 is the amount of oxygen (in mL) carried in 100 mL (or 1 dL) of blood. The oxygen content of hemoglobin depends upon the hemoglobin level and the physiological oxygen-binding capacity, according to the following formula:



9.7 




In this equation, the hemoglobin level will, of course, vary from individual to individual. The physiological oxygen-binding capacity is a constant 1.34 mL O
2
·g Hb
−1
, and the percent saturation of hemoglobin will vary between arterial and venous blood and resting and exercise conditions.







Example






Using an average hemoglobin level of 15 g·dL−1
, calculate the oxygen content for arterial blood where the percent saturation is 97%.











In
 
Figure 9.17

, look at the right side y-axis. This axis is of O
2
 content in mL·dL
−1
 rounded to the nearest whole number. The value for normal arterial blood at 97% saturation is the value just calculated.







Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference


The amount of oxygen released (dissociated) from the blood during one circuit through the systemic system is called the arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO
2
diff)
. That is, the a-vO2
diff is the difference between the amount of oxygen originally carried in the arterial blood and that returned in the venous blood. Before subtracting to obtain the a-vO2
diff, we must calculate the total oxygen in both the arteries and the veins. The amount normally carried in the arterial blood has already been determined. It is:





Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference (a-vO2diff)
 The difference between the amount of oxygen originally carried in arterial blood and the amount returned in venous blood.



Oxygen Dissociation
 The separation or release of oxygen from the RBCs to the tissues.












Example






Calculate the dissolved O2
 and HbO2
 in venous blood.







The calculations are as follows:












Now, add these values:












The a-vO
2
diff is calculated by the formula:



9.8 




Therefore, the difference, using the values already calculated, is:








Approximately 5 mL O
2
·dL
−1
 is used by the tissue to support cellular metabolism under normal resting conditions. This means that approximately 25% (4.59 ÷ 19.79 = 0.23 × 100 = 23%) of the oxygen is actually released from the hemoglobin to the tissues and used during rest. And, thus, approximately 75% of the oxygen is held in reserve for use when needed such as during physical exercise. The actual amount of oxygen used, measured as the a-vO
2
diff, is called the
 coefficient of oxygen utilization
. The normal resting coefficient of oxygen utilization is 4.59 mL·dL
−1
.




Note that the 75% is also the SbO
2
% value for venous blood. Refer to
 
Figure 9.17

 again. The shaded area at the top—between the SbO
2
% values of 97% and 75% on the left axis and between the values 19.79 and 15.20 mL·dL
−1
 on the right axis—represents these relative and absolute amounts of O
2
 that have been released or dissociated primarily from the RBCs. The separation or release of oxygen from the RBCs to the tissues is called

 oxygen dissociation
, and the curve is called the oxygen dissociation curve. Check your comprehension of oxygen transport in the box.

Carbon Dioxide Transport


Carbon dioxide is carried in three ways in the blood from muscles or other tissues where it is produced to the lungs, where it is eliminated from the body. As with O2
, the first way it is transported is by dissolving in blood plasma. The amount of CO2
 transported in this fashion is only about 5–10% of the total. However, as with dissolved O2
, it is this dissolved CO2
 component that determines the partial pressure of CO2
 in the blood. Because the exchange of CO2
 in internal and external respiration depends largely upon the PCO2
, this is a critical role for dissolved CO2
. The remaining 90–95% of the CO2
 diffuses into the RBCs.



As CO
2
 enters the RBC, about 20% combines chemically with the globin portion of the Hb molecule to produce
 carbamino hemoglobin
 (
HbCO
2
). This is the second form of CO
2
 transport. Some small quantity may combine with proteins in the plasma as well. Note that when CO
2
 combines with Hb, the CO
2
 is not competing with oxygen for space on the heme units, because it combines with the globin portion. However, more CO
2
 can combine with Hb if it is deoxygenated. That is, the lower the PO
2
 and SbO
2
%, the greater is the amount of CO
2
 that can be carried in the blood. This reaction is known as the
 Haldane effect
 (

Leff and Schumacker, 1993

).




At the lungs, the situation is reversed: as O
2
 saturates the Hb, less CO
2
 can be bound, so the release of CO
2
 is stimulated. Thus, Hb is really a transport vehicle carrying O
2
 from the alveoli to the cells and CO
2
 from the cells to the alveoli. This task is made easier by the fact that the dissociation (dropping off) of one molecule facilitates the binding (picking up) of the other at both sites.




The third way that CO
2
 is transported is as bicarbonate ions. Approximately 70–75% of the CO
2
 is transported in this way. When CO
2
 diffuses into the RBCs, it combines with water under the influence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and forms carbonic acid (H
2
CO
3
). Carbonic acid is weak and unstable and quickly dissociates into hydrogen ions (H
+
) and bicarbonate ions (HCO
3
−
). The chemical reaction is depicted as:








The H
+
 binds to Hb (H
+
 + Hb → HHb), thus preventing much change in pH, and the HCO
3
−
 diffuses into plasma. To counteract this loss of negative charges, chloride ions (Cl
−
) move from plasma to the RBC. This ion exchange is called the
 chloride shift
. At the lungs, where PCO
2
 is relatively low, the reactions are all reversed. The chemical reactions are:








Once back in the form of CO
2
, the CO
2
 diffuses along its partial pressure gradient from the blood to the alveoli and is exhaled (

Hall, 2016

;
 
Leff and Schumacker, 1993

). See animation, Transport of Carbon Dioxide, at

The Respiratory System and Acid-Base Balance


The ability of hemoglobin to bind the hydrogen ions (H+
) produced during the transport of carbon dioxide and the ability of pulmonary ventilation both to respond to (Figures 9.9
 and
 9.12
) and eliminate carbon dioxide are very important for maintaining acid-base balance. These reactions exemplify two of the three lines of defense for regulating acid-base balance: the chemical buffer system and the respiratory system. Furthermore, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is also directly involved in the third line of defense, renal regulation by the kidneys.



Acid-base balance
 involves a series of mechanisms that attempt to regulate the concentration of hydrogen ions in body fluids. This balance is vitally important, because virtually all biochemical reactions in the human body require the pH to be maintained within very narrow limits for proper functioning (

Hall, 2016

). Hydrogen ions come from several sources in the human body, but most result from the aerobic production of energy when oxygen is used and carbon dioxide is generated or when lactic acid accumulates in anaerobic energy production without the use of oxygen.




A
 chemical buffer
 is a system of one or more compounds that resists changes in pH when a strong acid or base is added. This is done by binding H
+
 ions whenever the pH drops and releasing them when the pH rises. Chemical buffers respond instantaneously. Hemoglobin is not the only chemical buffer, but in terms of capacity,

 it is the most important buffer in the blood. Bicarbonate (


) constitutes the alkaline reserve in the blood. The H
2
CO
3
 content of the blood is subject to respiratory controls.




The carbonic acid-bicarbonate system (H
2
CO
3
/HCO
3
−
) provides temporary buffering of hydrogen ions as they travel through the circulatory system. It also provides for the removal from the body of the carbon dioxide formed in the buffering process through
 respiratory regulation
. The sensitivity of pulmonary ventilation to PCO
2
 and pH enables varying amounts of acid

 production to be dealt with, because increased levels of carbon dioxide can be exhaled as needed. As explained earlier, an elevated PCO
2
 level in the blood activates medullary chemoreceptors that respond by increasing respiratory rate and depth; peripheral chemoreceptors respond to rising plasma H
+
 levels to also stimulate deeper and more rapid respiration. This expels more CO
2
 (an acid), converts the H
+
 to water, and quickly restores pH homeostasis. This respiratory compensation reacts within a matter of 1–3 minutes (

Slonim and Hamilton, 1976

;
 
Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

).




Renal regulation
 of acid-base balance has two goals: (1) to conserve or eliminate bicarbonate ions (HCO
3
−
), thereby stabilizing the amount in the body, and (2) to excrete hydrogen ions (in urine). Renal bicarbonate retention or excretion depends on the PCO
2
 in arterial blood. The kidneys are the most potent of the acid-base mechanisms. While the lungs can dispose of carbonic acid by eliminating CO
2
, only the kidneys can rid the body of the other acids generated by cellular metabolism including lactic acid and ketone bodies. However, they require hours or even days to effectively change pH (

Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

).




In the normal resting condition, venous pH is slightly lower than arterial pH (venous = 7.35, arterial = 7.4), but this difference has very little effect on most physiological functions. The key is maintaining arterial pH levels. Overall, then, not only does the respiratory system deliver oxygen for the production of energy and remove carbon dioxide, but it also contributes to the effective functioning of all biochemical reactions in the body through its role in maintaining acid-base balance.





SUMMARY





1.
 Respiration consists of pulmonary ventilation and oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchanges at the alveolar (external) and tissue (internal) levels.




2.
 Structurally, the pulmonary system can be divided into the conductive and respiratory zones. The conductive zone serves to transport air, warm and humidify air, and filter the air. Gas exchange takes place in the respiratory zone.




3.
 At rest, inspiration is an active process brought about by a pressure gradient that exceeds resistance to the flow of air. Resting expiration is a passive process accomplished primarily by elastic recoil.




4.
 The conductive zone makes up the anatomical dead space. An alveolar dead space occurs when functional alveoli are not supplied with capillaries or capillaries are pathologically blocked. Together, anatomical and alveolar dead spaces are called the physiological dead space.




5.
 Minute ventilation (


 or
 

) is the respiratory variable most commonly measured in exercise situations. Alveolar ventilation is the best measure of air available for gas exchange.




6.
 Residual volume, the amount of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiration, must be accounted for when one determines body composition by underwater weighing.




7.
 Respiratory measures are collected under ambient conditions (ATPS). Most lung volumes and capacities are then converted to body temperature values (BTPS). Minute ventilation may also be converted to standard temperature and pressure, dry (STPD) conditions.




8.
 Primary control of respiration resides in the ventral respiratory group (VRG) and dorsal respiratory group (DRG) in the medulla oblongata with input from the pontine respiratory center in the pons. Factors affecting these centers include:




a.
 Conscious thought through the cerebral cortex




b.
 Sympathetic nerve reactions through the hypothalamus




c.
 Irritants or lung inflammation through systemic receptors in the airways and lungs




d. PO
2
, PCO
2
, pH, and K
+
 through central and peripheral chemoreceptors




e. Movement via proprioceptive stimulation from mechanoreceptors and muscles and joints




9.
 Gases always flow down a pressure gradient. Each gas moves independently. Oxygen moves from the alveoli into arterial blood and red blood cells (RBCs) and then from the RBCs and capillary blood into the muscle tissues. Carbon dioxide moves from the muscle tissues into capillary blood and RBCs and then from the venous blood and RBCs into the alveoli.




10.
 Hemoglobin is composed of four iron heme units and one globin (a protein). When fully saturated, each hemoglobin molecule will have oxygen bound to each of its four heme structures. Normal arterial saturation (SaO
2
%) is 97%; normal resting venous saturation (SvO
2
%) is 75%.




11.
 Oxygen released from the RBCs at the tissue level is said to have been dissociated. At rest, the primary drive for this dissociation is the pressure gradient for oxygen.




12.
 At rest, only about 25% of circulated oxygen is used; 75% remains saturated in venous blood. These percentages translate into an arteriovenous oxygen difference of approximately 4.6 mL·dL
−1
.




13.
 Carbon dioxide is transported from the tissue to the lungs in three ways: dissolved, as carbamino hemoglobin, and as bicarbonate ions. The chemical buffering and removal of carbon dioxide from the body are important for maintaining acid-base balance.
