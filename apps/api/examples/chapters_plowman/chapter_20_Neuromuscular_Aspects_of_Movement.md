Introduction




As spectators watching the Olympic Games, we marvel at the grace and skill of figure skaters and stare in amazement at the incredible feats of gymnasts. As adults, we look on with wonder as a child learns a new task—rolling over, walking, tying a shoe—or an injured individual relearns basic skills. As coaches or fitness leaders, we experience the satisfaction of seeing individuals incorporate our suggestions to improve their skill. Understanding the awe-inspiring accomplishments of athletes and the simple movements that are often taken for granted requires knowledge of the nervous system.



The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It is the primary control and communication center for the entire body. The nervous system functions with the endocrine system to control and regulate the body’s internal environment; that is, it helps maintain homeostasis. All human movement depends on the nervous system; skeletal muscles will not contract unless they receive a signal from the nervous system.




This chapter introduces some basic neuroanatomy and examines the role of the somatic nervous system in controlling human movement. It also discusses the influence of the nervous system on flexibility and flexibility training and on balance and balance training.





The Nervous System




The nervous system is a fast-acting control system that regulates a virtually endless list of bodily functions. The nervous system has three primary functions:



1.
 Monitoring the internal and external environment through sensory receptors




2.
 Integrating the information it has received




3.
 Initiating and coordinating a response by activating muscles (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac) and glands (including endocrine glands)




These functions are accomplished by the cells of the nervous system (neurons) that communicate with each other and with effector organs (muscle and glands). Communication within a neuron occurs by electrical signals (action potentials). Communication between neurons or between neurons and an effector organ (e.g., skeletal muscle) occurs by chemical signals (neurotransmitters).



The Basic Structure of the Nervous System


As shown in Figure 20.1
, the nervous system can be structurally divided into the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the
 peripheral nervous system (PNS), which consists of all neural tissue outside the CNS. The PNS contains afferent
 and efferent neurons
. Afferent neurons
 relay information about the internal and external environment (from sensory receptors in the periphery) to the CNS. The CNS integrates information it receives from afferent neurons and responds by activating the efferent division. Efferent neurons
 relay signals from the CNS to effector organs in the periphery.









FIGURE 20.1
 Major Divisions of the Nervous System.
 The nervous system can be divided anatomically into the central (brain and spinal cord) nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral (sensory organs and nerves) nervous system (PNS). The nervous system can be functionally divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The somatic nervous system leads to contraction of muscle fibers through efferent (motor) neurons. The autonomic nervous system controls the heart, glands, and hollow organs and is essential in maintaining homeostasis.





The somatic (or motor) system, shown on the left side of
 
Figure 20.1

, sends signals from the CNS to skeletal muscle to initiate muscle contraction and thus movement. This is the focus of this chapter. Although we may not always achieve the desired result from such movement (think about your last golf outing), the somatic system is under voluntary control. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is involuntary, meaning we do not consciously control its activity. The autonomic nervous system, depicted on the right side of
 
Figure 20.1

, carries information from the CNS to cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and endocrine glands, thereby providing subconscious neural regulation of the internal environment of the body. The autonomic nervous system is discussed more fully in the following chapter.



Activation of the Nervous System


The somatic nervous system may be activated by conscious thought or by afferent input from the periphery. Afferent signals involved in regulating nervous control of muscle contraction rely on different types of sensory receptors: mechanoreceptors (pressure, stretch, or contraction) and proprioceptors (spatial orientation), located primarily in skeletal muscle, tendons, and joints. Activation of these receptors often results in a reflex movement. A reflex
 is a rapid, involuntary movement in response to a stimulus (discussed in more detail later in this chapter).


The Nerve Cell


The neuron, or nerve cell, is the functional unit of the nervous system. In addition to the afferent and efferent neurons described above, the central nervous system also has connection or association neurons. Neurons vary considerably in size and shape, depending on their function and location in the body. However, the neurons described in this text generally contain three distinct regions (Figure 20.2
). The dendrites, highly branched extensions of the neuron, are receptor sites that receive information and convey it to the cell body. The cell body is the control center. It integrates information that it receives from the dendrites and, if the signal is strong enough (at or above threshold level), passes it along to the axon. A cluster of cell bodies in the CNS is called a nucleus; a cluster of cell bodies in the PNS is called a ganglion.









FIGURE 20.2
 Generation of Action Potential.
 A.
 Resting (polarized) state. B.
 Action potential. In the resting state, the neuron cell membrane is polarized (the inside is negative relative to the outside). During an action potential, the membrane polarity is reversed and the inside of the cell becomes positive.





The axon of a motor neuron is a single extension of the neuron. The axon has two important functions: conducting the action potential and secreting the neurotransmitter. An action potential causes the axon to

 release a neurotransmitter (a chemical signal) from its axon terminal. The release of neurotransmitters allows neurons to communicate with one another. The length of axons varies according to the body location that is being innervated, but they may be very long. Axons that extend from the spinal cord to the feet may be over a meter long. A long axon is called a nerve fiber, and a bundle of axons is called a nerve. The axon may be myelinated (wrapped with Schwann cells) or unmyelinated.




Nerve cells have the functional characteristic of irritability (the ability to respond to a stimulus). That characteristic is evident in the dendrites and cell body. Nerve cells also have the characteristic of conductivity (the transmission of an electrical impulse from one location to another). The axon conducts an electrical impulse. In general, large-diameter nerves conduct an impulse faster than small-diameter nerves. A myelin sheath protects and electrically insulates axons and increases the rate at which electrical impulses can be conducted. For example, the nerve conduction velocity in an unmyelinated neuron is 13.5–22.5 min·hr
−1
; in a myelinated skeletal muscle neuron of the same diameter, the speed is 135–225 min·hr
−1
 (

The Neural Impulse


An impulse
 is a charge transmitted through certain tissue that results in the stimulation or inhibition of physiological activity. A neuron carries an electrical impulse, called the action potential. Neurons, and all cells, possess an electrical resting membrane potential. The resting membrane potential is the difference between the electrical charge on the inside of the cell and the charge on the outside of the cell (Figure 20.2A
). This resting potential results from the unequal distribution of positively and negatively charged ions. Negatively charged ions (anions [An−
]) predominate along the inside of the cell membrane and attract positively charged ions (cations) along the outside of the cell membrane. In a typical neuron at rest, sodium (Na+
) and chloride (Cl−
) ions predominate extracellularly. Potassium ions (K+
) and negatively charged protein anions predominate intracellularly.





Impulse
 An electrical charge transmitted through certain tissue that results in the stimulation or inhibition of physiological activity.



Action Potential
 Reversal of polarity or change in electrical potential.



Synapses
 The gap, or junction, between terminal ends of the axon and other neurons, muscle cells, or glands.





The cell membrane itself is composed of proteins floating in a bilayer of lipids. The membrane is permeable, or capable of allowing ions to pass through it, some by diffusion and some through specific protein channels. Channels may be passive (always open so that they allow a leakage) or active (requiring a chemical or electrical change to open their gates).




At rest, potassium (K
+
) “leaks” out through passive channels, and a sodium-potassium pump, which actively transports sodium out across the membrane and potassium back into the cell, removes three sodium ions from the cell for each two potassium ions it brings into the cell. Thus, at rest, there is a net loss of positive ions from the interior of the cell, making the interior negatively charged (−65 to −85 μV) relative to the exterior (

Figure 20.2A

). Thus, the resting neuron is said to be polarized.




When a sufficient stimulus (usually a chemical stimulus from other neurons) is applied to the cell, sodium (Na
+
) channels open, and positive ions flow into the neuron. Polarity in this region of the neuron is reversed; that is, the cell membrane is depolarized, meaning that the inside of the cell is now positive relative to the outside (

Figure 20.2B

). This process takes about 1 millisecond, at which time the sodium gates close and potassium gates open. Potassium exits the cell, bringing about repolarization, or a return to a net negative charge inside. Sodium is returned to the outside of the cell and potassium to the inside by the sodium-potassium pump, which restores the ionic balance and resting membrane potential. This sequence of events is repeated down the length of the axon. The reversal of polarity or change in electrical potential across a nerve membrane that generates an electrical current is an
 action potential
. The propagation of an action potential along the axon of a neuron is the mechanism by which electrical signals are sent within a neuron. Once generated in the axon, the action potential moves along the entire length of the axon and causes a neurotransmitter to be released from the terminal end of the axon. The terminal end of the axon communicates with other neurons, muscle cells, or glands across junctions known as
 synapses
. If the synapse is between a neuron and a muscle cell, it is known as a neuromuscular junction.





Neural Control of Muscle Contraction




Both the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system play important roles in controlling and regulating the body’s response to exercise. However, this chapter focuses on the role of the somatic nervous system in initiating and controlling skeletal muscle contraction. The role of the somatic nervous system in exercise is straightforward. Skeletal muscle will not contract unless it receives a signal from a motor neuron. The action potential in the neuron causes the neuron to release its neurotransmitter, which acts as the signal to initiate contraction. Thus, the somatic nervous system directly regulates exercise. (Chapter 19
 explains the events involved in muscle contraction in detail.)


Nerve Supply


All skeletal muscles require nervous stimulation to produce the electrical excitation in the muscle cells that leads to contraction. Efferent neurons
 carry information from the central nervous system to the muscle. Motor neurons

 are efferent neurons that innervate skeletal muscle and are classified as alpha motor neurons or gamma motor neurons. Alpha (α) motor neurons are relatively large motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscle fibers and result in contraction of muscles. Recall from Chapter 17
 that α1
 motor neurons innervate fast twitch (FT) muscle fibers, whereas α2
 motor neurons innervate slow twitch (ST) muscle fibers. Gamma (g) motor neurons
 innervate proprioceptors.



As a nerve enters the connective tissue of the muscle, it divides into branches that all end near the surface of a muscle fiber. Because the axon of the motor neuron branches, each neuron is connected to several muscle fibers. As defined in
 
Chapter 17

, a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates are called a
 motor unit
 (

Figure 20.3

). The motor unit is the basic unit of contraction. Because each muscle fiber in a motor unit is innervated by the same neuron, the electrical activity in that neuron controls the contractile activity of all the muscle fibers in that motor unit. The number of muscle fibers controlled by a single neuron (i.e., the number of muscle cells in a motor unit) varies tremendously, depending on the size and function of the muscle. Although a single neuron may innervate many muscle fibers, each muscle fiber is only innervated by a single motor neuron.










FIGURE 20.3
 Motor Units.
 Two motor units are depicted. Notice that the muscle fibers of the two motor units are intermingled.






Figure 20.4

 illustrates the relationship between the motor neuron (originating in the central nervous system labeled 1 in
 
Figure 20.4

) and muscle fibers. The cell body of the motor neuron is located within the gray matter of the spinal cord (labeled 2 in
 
Figure 20.4

), and the axon extends out through the ventral root of the spinal nerve (labeled 3 in
 
Figure 20.4

) to carry the electrical signal to the muscle fiber (labeled 4 in
 
Figure 20.4

). Each branch of the motor neuron terminates in a slight bulge called the axon terminal, which lies very close to but does not touch the underlying muscle fiber.

 A motor neuron and the muscle cells it innervates are called a motor unit. (1) Schematic of central nervous system, (2) cross-sectional view of the spinal cord, (3) cross-sectional view of peripheral nerve emphasizing axon of motor neuron, and (4) the motor neuron branching near its terminal end where it forms the neuromuscular junction with the muscle fibers it innervates
.




The space between the membrane of the neuron and the muscle cell membrane at the motor end plate
 is called the neuromuscular (or synaptic) cleft. The entire region is referred to as the neuromuscular junction
. The neuromuscular junction is important because the electrical signal from the motor neuron is transmitted here, via a neurotransmitter, to the surface of the muscle cell that is to contract.



Muscle cells also have afferent (sensory) nerve endings, which are sensitive to mechanical and chemical changes in the muscle tissue and which relay this information back to the central nervous system. The information carried by afferent neurons is used by the central nervous system to make adjustments in muscular contractions.



The Neuromuscular Junction


The neuromuscular junction is a specialized synapse formed between a terminal end of a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. Figure 20.5
 summarizes the events that occur at the neuromuscular junction. When a neuronal action potential reaches the axon terminal, the membrane of the neuron increases its permeability to calcium, and calcium is taken up into the cell (Figure 20.5A
). The increased level of calcium causes the synaptic vesicles to migrate to the cell membrane and release the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine, ACh) into the synaptic cleft by the process of exocytosis (Figure 20.5B
). The ACh then diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the sarcolemma, causing changes in the ionic permeability (especially to the inward flow of Na+
) and leading to the depolarization of the sarcolemma (Figure 20.5C
). This change in permeability and subsequent depolarization leads to the generation of an action potential in the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads in all directions from the neuromuscular junction, depolarizing the entire sarcolemma. The action potential then spreads into the interior of the
 cell through the T tubules (Figure 20.5D
) as described in Chapter 17
.

 The AP is propagated into the interior of the cells via the T tubules.





Although the neuromuscular junction functions much like other synapses, there are three important differences.




1.
 At a neuromuscular junction, a single presynaptic action potential leads to a postsynaptic action potential.




2.
 The synapse can only be excitatory.




3.
 A muscle fiber receives synaptic input from only one motor neuron.




Note the two distinct roles that calcium plays in controlling muscular contraction. The first is to facilitate the release of ACh from the synaptic vesicles in the motor neuron terminal. The second (and most often discussed) role of calcium is to control the position of the regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin on actin (as explained in
 
Chapter 19

).





Reflex Control of Movement




Reflexes play important roles in maintaining an upright posture, responding to movement in a coordinated fashion, and mediating responses to stretching. A reflex
 is a rapid, involuntary response to stimuli in which a specific stimulus results in a specific motor response. Reflexes can be classified as autonomic reflexes
, which activate cardiac and smooth muscle and glands, or somatic reflexes
, which result in skeletal muscle contraction. This section focuses on somatic reflexes, which play an important role in movement.





Reflex
 Rapid, involuntary response to stimuli in which a specific stimulus results in a specific motor response.





Many spinal reflexes do not require the participation of higher brain centers to initiate a response. Higher brain centers, however, are often notified of the resultant movement by neurons that synapse with the afferent neuron.



Spinal Cord


The spinal cord is involved in both involuntary and voluntary movements. The spinal cord connects the peripheral nervous system with the brain and serves as the site of reflex integration.




Figure 20.6

 shows a cross-sectional view of the spinal cord. Note the spinal nerves extending from each side of the cord. Each spinal nerve contains afferent (sensory) fibers and efferent (motor) fibers. The cell bodies of the afferent neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal nerve, which is part of the peripheral nervous system. The cell bodies of the efferent neurons, however, are located within the central nervous system, and the axon exits through the ventral root of the spinal nerve. The most familiar efferent neurons are the alpha motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscles leading to muscle contraction. The dorsal root and ventral root of the spinal nerve carry only afferent and efferent fibers, respectively. The two roots join to form a spinal nerve. Therefore, even though individual neurons have only sensory or motor functions, a nerve typically contains both afferent and efferent neurons and so has both sensory and motor functions.










FIGURE 20.6
 Cross-Sectional View of the Spinal Cord Showing the Relationships between the Spinal Cord and Vertebra.





Information is carried up and down the spinal cord through a series of tracts. A tract is a bundle of fibers in the central nervous system. The tracts that carry sensory (afferent) information are called ascending tracts. The tracts that carry motor (efferent) information are called descending tracts. Specific tracts are responsible for carrying different types of sensory information (such as pressure and temperature) and motor information (such as fine distal movement).




The descending pathways of the spinal cord can be divided into the pyramidal and extrapyramidal pathways. Both include several descending tracts that carry specific information. Voluntary motor impulses are transmitted from the motor area of the brain to somatic efferent neurons leading to skeletal muscles via the
 pyramidal pathways
.



Pyramidal System


The pyramidal (corticospinal) system is composed of neurons with cell bodies that originate in the cerebral cortex and axons that travel through the spinal cord. The neurons that extend from the brain down through the descending tract are called the upper motor neurons
 (see Figure 20.4
). These neurons synapse with the lower motor neurons, also known as the alpha (α) motor neurons, in the anterior gray matter of the spinal cord. The lower motor neurons then carry the message to specific skeletal muscles that control precise, discrete movement.



Both the lateral and anterior corticospinal (pyramidal) tracts decussate, or cross over, as they descend from the brain. Therefore, the motor cortex of the right side of the brain controls the muscles on the left side of the body, and vice versa. Thus, a patient who has had a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) on the right side of the brain may lose the motor function of the left side of the body.



Extrapyramidal System


The extrapyramidal system consists of all descending tracts not included in the pyramidal system. Typically, the neurons found in these tracts have cell bodies located in the basal nuclei or reticular formation of the brain. The extrapyramidal system carries information that controls muscle tone and posture as well as head movements in response to visual stimuli and changes in equilibrium.


Components of a Reflex Arc


Many of our movements depend on spinal reflexes. Spinal reflexes also play an important role in stretching activities. The neural pathway over which a reflex occurs is called a reflex arc. The basic components of a reflex arc are as follows (Figure 20.7
).

 (motor) neuron carries the impulse from the central nervous system to the body organ that is to respond to the original stimulus.

Proprioceptors and Related Reflexes


Proprioceptive sensations provide an awareness of the activities of the muscles, tendons, and joints and provide a sense of equilibrium. This section describes the role of these proprioceptive senses in order to explain the somatosensory system. However, it is important to remember that the other senses and receptors also play a major role in human movement. For example, we use the visual sense to gain important information regarding the speed and direction of a tennis ball during a tennis match. We also listen to the sound of the impact of the ball on the opponent’s racket to help judge the return. Remember that human movement is not only extremely complex but also affected by a host of factors, including sensory receptors of all types.



Stimulation of the proprioceptors gives rise to kinesthetic perceptions. Historically,
 kinesthesis
 was defined as a person’s perception of his or her own motion, specifically the motion of the limbs relative to each other and the body as a whole.
 Proprioception
 was defined as the perception of movement of the body plus its orientation in space. Over the years, these terms have become practically synonymous (

Schmidt, 1988

). Relatively simple exercises using Swiss balls and stability balls can be used to as part of a proprioceptive training program (see accompanying Focus on Research Box).







FOCUS ON RESEARCH: CLINICALLY RELEVANT






Propriception Training to Improve Balance and Decrease Risk of Falls in Elderly






Falls are a significant cause of injury and fatality for older individuals. There are multiple factors that increase the risk for falls in older adults. Previous studies have investigated traditional strength training programs as an intervention to improve strength and decrease the risk of falls. Martínez-López and colleagues designed a study to investigate the effects of proprioceptive training programs on balance and the risk of falls in older adults. Study participants (n = 56) were divided into two groups, 28 participants (mean age = 79.3 years) received the intervention and the other 26 individuals (mean age = 77.0 years) served as a control group. The intervention group participated in a 12-week proprioception/balance training program that was performed twice a week for a total of 24 sessions, while the control group was prescribed general exercise on the same days. The proprioception exercise sessions contained six specific proprioceptive exercises utilizing a Swiss ball or a wobble ball for 5 minutes each. The proprioception program was progressive and consisted of an initial phase from weeks 1 to 5, an intermediate phase between weeks 5 and 8, and an advanced phase between weeks 8 and 12. A balance test was administered at the beginning of the study using the Berg test. The Berg test is a functional test of balance that consists of 14 observable tasks of daily life. The risk of falls was also assessed before and after the training program. Risk of falls was measured using the Tinetti scale, which assesses gait and balance. The balance component of the Tinetti scale involves testing the following maneuvers in a hard, armless chair: sitting balance, arise, attempts to arise, immediate standing balance, standing balance, nudged, eyes closed, turning, and sitting down. Each of these components can receive a score of 0, 1, or 2, meaning that a maximum score of 28 is possible. Patients with a score of 24 or below are considered at risk of falls. A score below 19 is associated with a high risk of falls (Raiche et al., 2000). The accompanying figure shows the results of this study. The training program resulted in a significant increase in balance and a lower risk of falling (indicated by a higher score on the Tinetti scale).











The results of this study are very encouraging as they demonstrate that even a short training program that focuses on proprioceptive/balance training can increase dynamic balance and decrease risk of fall-related injuries in older adults.

Vestibular Apparatus


Specialized equilibrium receptors in the inner ear, called the vestibular apparatus, provide important proprioceptive sensations. The primary function of the vestibular apparatus is to maintain equilibrium and to preserve a constant plane of head position by modifying muscle tone (Sage, 1971
). Receptors of the vestibular apparatus are located in the vestibule and in the semicircular canals.



The vestibule is comprised of two fluid-filled, sac-like structures called the utricle and saccule. The receptors in these structures, the maculae, sense information about the position of the head when the body is not moving or is accelerating linearly. The semicircular canals are oriented in three planes of space; that is, each of the semicircular canals is positioned at right angles to the other. This arrangement allows the equilibrium receptors in the semicircular canals, the crista ampullaris, to detect angular movement of the head in any plane. The receptors in the semicircular canals are sensitive to changes in the velocity of head movements—that is, to angular acceleration.




Information from the vestibular apparatus is transmitted to the brain via the vestibulocochlear nerve. The information is carried to the vestibular nuclear complex and the cerebellum. Here, it is processed along with information from visual receptors and the somatic receptors of the muscles, tendons, and joints. Although the vestibular receptors are very important, they can be overruled by information from other receptors. For example,

 the spotting technique (keeping the eyes focused on one spot) used by figure skaters allows them to perform spins without becoming dizzy.



Muscle Spindles and the Myotatic Reflex


Muscle spindles (sometimes called neuromuscular spindles, NMS) are located in skeletal muscle. They lie parallel to and are embedded in the skeletal muscle fibers. These receptors are stimulated by stretch and provide information to the central nervous system regarding the length and rate of length change in skeletal muscles. Stimulation of the muscle spindles results in reflex contraction of the stretched muscle via a myotatic reflex, also known as a stretch reflex (Hall, 2016
). Thus, the muscle spindle performs both a sensory and a motor function.




Figure 20.8

 represents a muscle spindle and its nerve supply. The muscle spindle consists of a fluid-filled capsule composed of connective tissue; it is long and cylindrical with tapered ends. The typical spindle is 4–7 mm long and approximately 1/5 the diameter of a muscle fiber (extrafusal fiber) (

Sage, 1971

). The capsule contains specialized muscle fibers called
 intrafusal muscle fibers
. In contrast to intrafusal fibers, skeletal muscle fibers that produce muscular movement are sometimes called
 extrafusal fibers
. Each end of the spindle is attached to extrafusal muscle fibers.










FIGURE 20.8
 Muscle Spindle and Its Nerve Supply.
 Muscle spindles transmit sensory information through flower-spray neurons and annulospiral neurons. The muscle spindle also receives motor (efferent) information from gamma efferent fibers.





Two types of intrafusal fibers are located within the muscle spindle: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers.
 Nuclear bag fibers
 are thicker and contain many centrally located nuclei. These fibers extend beyond the spindle capsule and attach to the connective tissue of the extrafusal fibers.
 Nuclear chain fibers
 are shorter and thinner and have fewer nuclei in the central area of the fiber. Both types of intrafusal fibers contain contractile elements at their distal poles. The central region of the fibers does not contain contractile elements; this is the sensory receptor area of the spindle.




A typical muscle spindle contains 1–3 nuclear bag fibers and 3–9 nuclear chain fibers (

Hall, 2016

). The intrafusal fibers of the spindle are innervated by sensory nerves called annulospiral and flower-spray neurons. The branches of the
 annulospiral neurons
 wrap around the nucleated parts of both types of intrafusal fibers. These annulospiral fibers are large, myelinated fibers (

Standring, 2005

).




The branches of the
 flower-spray neurons
 wrap around only the nuclear chain fibers (

Standring, 2005

). The flower-spray fibers are smaller and conduct impulses slower than the annulospiral fibers. Both types of afferent fibers are stimulated when the central portion of the

 spindle is stretched. Since the intrafusal fibers are arranged in parallel with the extrafusal fibers, they are stretched or shortened with the whole muscle. The flower-spray nerve endings have a higher threshold of excitation than the annulospiral nerve endings. The flower-spray nerve endings provide information about relative muscle length; the annulospiral nerve endings respond primarily to the rate of length change.




The contractile intrafusal fibers also receive motor innervation from the central nervous system. The efferent fibers that terminate on the intrafusal fibers are called gamma efferents (γ motor neurons), or fusimotor neurons. The axons of the gamma motor neurons travel in the spinal nerve and terminate on the distal ends of the intrafusal fibers. Stimulation of the gamma motor neurons produces contraction of the intrafusal fiber, which causes the central region of the spindle to be stretched. Gamma motor neurons are important enough to comprise almost a third of all motor neurons in the body.



MYOTATIC REFLEX The myotatic or stretch reflex has two separate components: a dynamic reaction and a static reaction. The dynamic reaction occurs in response to a sudden change in length of the muscle. When a muscle is quickly stretched, the annulospiral nerve endings (but not the flower-spray endings) transmit an impulse to the spinal cord, which results in an immediate strong reflex contraction of the same muscle from which the signal originated (Hall, 2016
). This is what happens in the knee-jerk response, diagrammed in Figure 20.9
, or in the head-jerk response when you fall asleep sitting up reading a book not nearly as interesting as this one. Because this reflex does not require that information be processed by the brain, it occurs very quickly.









FIGURE 20.9
 Myotatic (Stretch) Reflex.
 A stimulus (1) is transmitted to the CNS via the afferent neuron (2). In the CNS, the afferent neuron bifurcates and synapses with an alpha motor neuron (3a) and an association neuron (3b). The alpha motor neuron (4a) leads to contraction of the agonist (quadriceps). The efferent fiber (4b) that synapses with the association neuron result in relaxation of antagonist (hamstrings) and leads to knee extension (5). Gamma efferent neurons (6) innervate the muscle spindles and help provide smooth, coordinated movements.





Stretching of the skeletal muscle results in the stimulation of the muscle spindle fibers, which monitor changes in muscle length. In the knee-jerk response, the stretch is initiated by a tapping on the patellar tendon, causing a deformation that stretches the quadriceps muscle group ([1] in
 
Figure 20.9

). Sudden stretching of the muscle spindle causes an impulse to be sent to the spinal cord by way of the annulospiral nerve fibers ([2] in
 
Figure 20.9

). In the gray matter of the spinal cord, this sensory fiber bifurcates, with one branch synapsing with an alpha motor neuron ([3a] in
 
Figure 20.9

). The other branch synapses with an association neuron ([3b] in
 
Figure 20.9

). The alpha motor neuron exits the spinal cord and synapses with the skeletal muscle, which was originally stretched ([4a] in
 
Figure 20.9

),

 resulting in a contraction that is roughly equal in force and distance to the original stretch ([5] in
 
Figure 20.9

). The inhibitory association neuron synapses with another efferent neuron, which innervates the antagonist muscle (hamstring group in this example), where it causes inhibition; this reflex relaxation of the antagonist muscle in response to the contraction of the agonist is called
 reciprocal inhibition
. This response facilitates contraction of the agonist muscle that was stimulated; the inhibited antagonist cannot resist the contraction of the agonist ([4b] in
 
Figure 20.9

). The muscle spindle is also supplied with a gamma efferent neuron; for clarity, this neuron is shown on the opposite side of the spinal cord ([6] in
 
Figure 20.9

).

Muscle Tonus
 A state of low-level muscle contraction at rest.





As soon as the lengthening of the muscle stops increasing, the rate of impulse discharge returns to its original level, except for a small static response that is maintained as long as the muscle is longer than its normal length. The static response is elicited by both the annulospiral and flower-spray nerve endings. The resultant low-level muscle contractions oppose the force that is causing the excess length, with the ultimate goal of returning to the resting length. A static response is also invoked if the sensory receptor portion of the neuromuscular spindle is stretched slowly.




Normally, muscle spindles emit low-level sensory nerve signals that help maintain muscle tonus and postural adjustments.
 Muscle tonus
 is a state of low-level muscle contraction at rest. Muscle spindles also respond to stretch by an antagonistic muscle, to gravity, or to a load being applied to the muscle. The head jerk is an example of the response to gravity, but other muscles such as the back extensors and quadriceps function the same way for unconscious postural adjustments. As an example of the load stimulus, think about what happens if you stand with your elbows at 90 degrees, palms up, and someone places a 10-lb weight in your hands. Before you can consciously adjust to this weight, and because the weight stretches your biceps, the muscle spindles cause a reflex contraction that stops your hands from dropping too far.




In addition to providing maintenance of muscle tone and adjustments for posture and load, the neuromuscular spindle also serves as a damping mechanism that facilitates smooth muscle contractions. This is accomplished by a
 gamma loop
.




In a gamma loop, the stretch reflex is activated by the gamma motor neurons ([6] in
 
Figure 20.9

). Recall that the gamma motor neurons originate in the spinal cord and innervate the distal contractile portions of the intrafusal fibers. Pick up a rubber band and hold it at its maximal, unstretched length with your fingers. Now pull on both ends. What happens to the rubber band in the middle? Obviously, it is stretched. This is precisely what happens when the gamma motor neurons stimulate contractions at both ends of the intrafusal fibers. The central, noncontractile portion of the fibers is stretched, deforming the sensory nerve endings and eliciting the myotatic stretch response.




What stimulates gamma motor neurons, and why? When signals are transmitted to the alpha motor neurons from the motor cortex or other areas of the brain, gamma motor neurons are almost always simultaneously stimulated. This action is called
 coactivation
, and it serves several purposes. First, it provides damping, as mentioned earlier. Alpha and gamma neural signals to contract sometimes arrive asynchronously. But because the response to the gamma motor neuron stimulation is contraction anyway, the gaps can be filled in by reflex contractions, thereby smoothing out the force of contraction. Second, coactivation maintains proper load responsiveness regardless of the muscle length. If, for example, the extrafusal fibers contract less than the intrafusal fibers owing to a heavy external load, the mismatch would elicit the stretch reflex, and the additional extrafusal fiber excitation would cause more shortening (

Hall, 2016

). Similarly, because the intrafusal and extrafusal lengths are adjusted to each other, the neuromuscular spindle may be able to help compensate for fatigue by recruiting additional extrafusal fibers by reflex action. Finally, sensory information from neuromuscular spindles is always carried to higher brain centers, where it is unconsciously integrated with other sensory information. If the muscle spindles were not adjusted to the length of the extrafusal fibers during contraction, information on muscle length and the rate of length change could not be transmitted (

Hall, 2016

). Since gamma fibers do adjust the muscle spindle fibers, the gamma loop can assist voluntary motor activity, but it does not actually control voluntary motor activity.



PLYOMETRICS Plyometrics
, also known as depth jumping or rebound training, is a training exercise in which a concentric contraction is immediately preceded by an eccentric contraction. Plyometrics is an explosive form of physical training used to enhance power output, force production, and velocity. It involves such activities as jumping off a box with both feet together and then immediately performing a maximal jump back onto the box. Plyometric training, alone or in combination with other training modalities, has been shown to be effective in improving power output, force production, jumping height, athletic performance, and bone mineral density (Bobbert, 1990
; Markovic and Mikulic, 2010
; Robinson et al., 2004
; Wilson et al., 1993
). While plyometric training has proven effective in improving lower extremity strength, power, and stretch-shortening muscle function, the mechanisms responsible for the improved performance have not been fully elucidated. However, it appears that the adaptive neuromuscular changes are the result of several factors, including increased neural drive, changes in muscle activation, changes in the mechanical properties of the muscle-tendon complex, and changes in muscle size and/or architecture (Markovic and Mikulic, 2010
)
.



The stretch reflex is caused by activation of the muscle spindles in the agonist muscle. As the agonist is stretched during the eccentric phase of the movement, the muscle spindles activate a reflex arc culminating in stimulation of the alpha motor neuron and enhanced concentric contraction of the agonist. That is, stretching a muscle before concentrically contracting results in a more forceful contraction than if no prestretch occurred. In addition, as described in
 
Chapter 18

 (see Stretch Shortening Cycle,
 
Figure 18.8

), elastic proteins in the muscle act in a similar manner as a rubber band to enhance the force of contraction. During the eccentric phase, these series elastic components are stretched and stored as potential energy. The stored energy is released on initiation of the concentric phase, allowing a more forceful contraction (

Potach and Chu, 2000

).




Muscular strength changes are routinely found after plyometric training, and research indicates that increased drive to alpha-motor neuron pool post training may contribute to strength gains (Alkjaer et al., 2013, Taube et al., 2012b). Neural adaptations responsible for increased strength and power in jump and landing performance, such as during plyometric training, may be dependent on drop height. To maximize rebound height most efficiently, high drop heights should be implemented into training if time on the ground is not a factor. In contrast, low drop heights should be incorporated to improve time and power output (Taube et al., 2012b). During planned landing activity, such as during plyometric training, there is the potential for the CNS to predict the time of ground contact and to contribute to the control of muscular activity at the time of ground contact. Such CNS-mediated programmed muscular activity may interact with components of reflex responses. Thus, the CNS may initiate jumping movement and participate with reflexes in modifying muscular response to landing (

Taube et al., 2012a

).







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






The Role of Plyometrics in the Prevention of Lower Extremity Injuries






Plyometric training is often used to increase muscle strength and improve athletic performance. However, there is compelling evidence that plyometric training can decrease the risk of lower extremity injuries, specifically, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in female athletes who participate in sports that involve jumping and pivoting. The results from training studies indicate a reduction in the rate of injuries
 or a decrease in the risk factors
 associated with ACL injuries (such as knee instability, imbalance between quadriceps, and hamstring ratio). Hewett et al. (1999)
 prospectively monitored high school female athletes (soccer, volleyball, and basketball) to access the effectiveness of plyometric training on the rate of injuries. Fifteen sports team participated in a 6-week plyometric training program during their preseason training. Fifteen sports teams did not participate in the structured preseason plyometric training program and served as the control group. The plyometric training consisted of jump and landing techniques designed to increase vertical jump height and increase lower extremity strength. Training sessions lasted 6 weeks and were led by trained coaches and physical therapists. The training sessions lasted 60–90 minutes a day, 3 d·wk−1
. Following the training program, the researchers monitored the athletes during their competitive season by compiling weekly injury data. Injury data included reporting of all injuries and in-depth information regarding lower extremity injuries. Serious injuries were defined as a loss of at least 5 consecutive days of practice or competition. All ACL ruptures were confirmed by arthroscopy. The study found a significantly lower rate of lower extremity injuries in female athletes who engaged in plyometric training compared to those who did not engage in plyometric training. In fact, untrained female athletes had a 3.6 times higher incidence of knee injury than the trained females. This study clearly suggests the preventative role plyometric training can play in reducing the number of knee injuries. Encouragingly, many other studies have replicated this finding.

Golgi Tendon Organs and Inverse Myotatic Reflex


Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are receptors activated by stretch or active contraction of a muscle. They transmit information about muscle tension. Activation of these receptors results in a reflex inhibition of the muscle via the inverse myotatic reflex (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
). GTOs are located in the tendons, close to the point of muscular attachment. As shown in Figure 20.10
, each Golgi tendon organ consists of a thin capsule of connective tissue
 enclosing collagenous fibers. The collagenous fibers within the capsule are penetrated by fibers of sensory neuron whose terminal branches intertwine with the collagenous fibers. This afferent neuron relays information about muscle tension to the spinal cord. The information is then transmitted to muscle efferents and/or to higher brain centers, particularly the cerebellum.









FIGURE 20.10
 Golgi Tendon Organ.





The Golgi tendon organ is in series with the muscle. The Golgi tendon organ therefore can be stimulated by either stretch or contraction of the muscle. Because of elongation properties of the muscle during stretch, however, active contraction of a muscle is more effective in initiating action potentials within the Golgi tendon organ.



INVERSE MYOTATIC REFLEX As with the myotatic reflex, the inverse myotatic reflex has both a static and dynamic component. When tension increases abruptly and intensely, the dynamic response is invoked. Within milliseconds, this dynamic response becomes a lower-level static response within the GTO that is proportional to the muscle tension. The sequence of events in the inverse myotatic reflex is diagrammed in Figure 20.11
.









FIGURE 20.11
 Inverse Myotatic Reflex.
 A stimulus (1) is transmitted to the CNS via the afferent neuron (2). In the CNS, association neurons (3) activate efferent neurons (4a and b) that result in relaxation of the agonist (5).





Contraction of a skeletal muscle (or stretching) results in tension that stimulates the Golgi tendon organs in the tendon attached to the skeletal muscle ([1] in
 
Figure 20.11

). Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organ results in the transmission of impulses to the spinal cord by afferent neurons ([2] in
 
Figure 20.11

). In the spinal cord, the afferent neuron synapses with an inhibitory association neuron and an excitatory motor neuron ([3] in
 
Figure 20.11

). In turn, the inhibitory association neuron synapses with a motor neuron that innervates the muscle attached to the tendon; the inhibitory impulses lead to the relaxation of the contracted muscle ([4a] in
 
Figure 20.11

). The excitatory association neuron synapses with a motor neuron that innervates the antagonist muscle ([4b] in
 
Figure 20.11

).




Note that as the muscle group originally exhibiting the tension (the agonist) is relaxed, the opposing muscle group (or antagonist) is reciprocally activated. The relaxing action of the Golgi tendon organ serves several important functions. First, the Golgi tendon organ protects against muscle and tendon damage. Excessive tension that might cause muscles and tendons to be torn or pulled away from their attachments is prevented by action of the Golgi tendon organ. For example, a weight lifter who manages to get a heavier barbell off the ground than he or she can really handle may suddenly find his or her muscle giving out because of the action of the Golgi tendon organs. It is speculated that increases in the amount of weight that can be lifted following resistance training are in part due to an inhibition of the Golgi tendon organs, allowing for a more forceful muscle contraction (

Gabriel et al., 2006

).




The second important advantage of Golgi tendon organ–mediated relaxation is that muscle fibers that are relaxed can be stretched further by opposing muscles or external force without damage. This response is useful in the development of flexibility

.




Third, the sensory information regarding tension, which is provided to the cerebellum, allows for muscle adjustment so that only the amount of tension needed to complete the movement is produced. This feature ensures both a smooth beginning and a smooth ending to a movement and is particularly important in movements such as running that involve a rapid cycling between flexion and extension (

Biering-Sorensen, 1984

).





Volitional Control of Movement




Reflexes are important for controlling human movement, but the volitional control of movement required for skilled movement involves even more complexity. Furthermore, volition and reflexes often work simultaneously to ensure smooth, coordinated movement. This section discusses the volitional control of motor units and of whole muscles.


Volitional Control of Individual Motor Units


Healthy people often take the ability to move for granted; they assume that if their brain sends the proper signal, the desired action will simply occur. One discovers that it is not quite that simple when attempting to learn a new sports or when illness or injury intervenes. We normally do not think about conscious control of single motor units. Most people consider reflex action the most basic, albeit unconscious, form of muscle action. But even reflexes involve more than one motor unit and result in muscle activity that can be felt by the individual. In reality, motor unit control is the most basic level of volitional control of movement that can be achieved.




Basmajian (1967)

 and colleagues performed a series of experiments using intramuscular electrodes attached to a tape recorder and audio amplifier for sound and an oscilloscope and camera for visual feedback. Initially, when subjects were asked to activate a motor unit, say, in the little finger, they moved the finger and got a typical EMG tracing such as the one shown in
 
Figure 20.12D

. Gradually, as movement was decreased to virtually nothing but neural signals were still being sent, a single motor unit (identifiable by a characteristic sound and spike pattern) (

Figure 20.12A

) was isolated. Once one motor unit had been isolated, the frequency of its recruitment could be varied. Other motor units could also be isolated (

Figure 20.12B

 and
 
C

), and firings could be varied between the motor units. Thus, it has been shown that one truly can control motor units. Precisely,
 how
 this control is achieved is unclear both to the subjects doing it and to the scientists observing it, although some type of proprioceptive feedback is suspected.

Such delicate, discrete control has obvious implications for the refinement of motor skills. Perhaps its greatest benefit, however, is in the area of therapeutic rehabilitation. For example, bioengineers can use trained motor units to control myoelectric protheses and orthoses. Individuals disabled with conditions such as cerebral palsy can learn better motor control. And some individuals whose spinal cords have been injured but not totally destroyed can learn through such biofeedback to control first one motor unit and then another to regain muscle movement.



Volitional Control of Muscle Movement


Although the way the nervous system initiates and controls muscle movement has been studied for over 100 years, it is still not fully understood. Volitional movement is the result of cognitive processes, which ultimately lead to muscular contraction (Schwartz, 2016). Figure 20.13
 provides a simplistic overview of volitional movement. The brain initiates movement ([1] in Figure 20.13
); that is, the plan for a desired movement, whether to lift a book or perform the high jump, originates in the brain. This information is transmitted down the appropriate descending tract ([2] in Figure 20.13
). The neurons of the descending tract synapse with the motor neurons in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The efferent motor neuron then carries the impulse to the muscle, the effector organ ([3] in Figure 20.13
).









FIGURE 20.13
 Overview of Volitional Movement.
 Voluntary movement is initiated by the motor cortex (1). Neural signals are transmitted down the descending tracts (2) and carried to the muscles via efferent motor neurons (3) that synapse with the target muscles (4) to cause contraction (5). Movement causes stimulation of the afferent neurons (6) that synapse with association neurons (7a) in the spinal cord and then transmit the signal to neurons in the ascending tract (7b). Information from multiple sources, including multiple neurons in the ascending tract and sensory neurons is integrated in the brain (8) and appropriate adjustments are made to ensure movements correspond with intended movement.





On receiving the signal from the nervous system, the muscle contracts and produces movement ([4] in
 
Figure 20.13

). Changes in muscle length, tension, and position stimulate receptors in the muscles and joints of surrounding muscles ([5] in
 
Figure 20.13

). This information is transmitted to the central nervous system through afferent sensory neurons ([6] in
 
Figure 20.13

). The afferent neurons synapse with various association neurons in the gray matter of the spinal cord. In some instances, the neurons synapse with association neurons, which synapse with efferent motor neurons to reflexively control movement ([7a] in

 
Figure 20.13

). In other cases, the association neurons synapse with neurons of the ascending tract, which will carry the information to the brain ([7b] in
 
Figure 20.13

).




The signals from the ascending pathway are transmitted to the brain, where the information is perceived, compared, evaluated, and integrated in light of past experience, desired outcome, and additional sensory information ([8] in
 
Figure 20.13

). The brain then adjusts its original message, which is again sent to the muscles via the descending pathway and the motor neuron.




This cycle continues throughout the duration of a given activity. The speed at which the information is transmitted is as remarkable as the degree of integration that occurs. What seems an instantaneous response, on, say, a racquetball court (such as reaction to a powerful serve), actually requires a vast amount of communication within the neuromuscular system.




As already stated, many movements rely on both involuntary reflex action and volitional control of movement. An example is flexibility exercise. Although we decide to initiate stretches, the responses to them depend largely on reflexes.





Flexibility





Flexibility
 is the range of motion (ROM) in a joint or series of joints that reflects the ability of the musculotendon structures to elongate within the physical limitations of the joint (Hubley-Kozey, 1991
). Neither pain nor injury should be involved in this range. The two basic types of flexibility are static and dynamic. Static flexibility
 is the range of motion about a joint without considering how easily or quickly the range of motion is achieved. Dynamic flexibility
 is the resistance to motion in a joint that affects how easily and quickly a joint can move through its range of motion. Dynamic flexibility is also defined as the rate of increase in tension in a contracted or relaxed muscle as it is stretched. Thus, dynamic flexibility accounts for the resistance to stretch (Knudson et al., 2000
). Dynamic flexibility is undoubtedly more important than static flexibility in relation to athletic performances (especially speed events) and the health or diseased condition of the joints (such as arthritis). Resistance to stretch is measured as stiffness
. The opposite of stiffness is compliance (alteration in response to force). Stiffness is determined by the slope of a curve that plots the load (torque) against elongation (range of motion) for the individual. The steeper the line, the stiffer the muscle is. This testing requires specialized laboratory equipment (Gleim and McHugh, 1997
). No standardized measurement technique exists for evaluating dynamic flexibility in practical settings (Plowman, 1992
). Therefore, unless specifically stated otherwise, the discussion that follows is limited to static flexibility.





Flexibility
 The range of motion in a joint or series of joints that reflects the ability of the musculotendon structures to elongate within the physical limits of the joint.





Several anatomical factors affect the range of motion in any given joint. The first is the actual structural arrangement of the joint—that is, the way the bones articulate. Each joint has a specific bony configuration that generally cannot and should not be altered. The soft tissue surrounding the joint, including the skin, ligaments, fascia, muscles, and tendons, also affects joint range of motion. The skin normally has very little influence on the range of motion. The ligaments provide joint stability, and their restriction of range of motion is generally considered necessary and beneficial. Thus, the muscles and their connective tissues are the critical factors that determine flexibility and that can be altered by stretching training.




Muscles actively resist elongation through contraction and passively resist elongation because of the noncontractile elements of elasticity and plasticity. The difference between elastic and plastic properties is similar to the difference between a rubber band and a balloon. If the rubber band is stretched and then let go, it should rebound to its original length—at least when it is new and has not been frequently stretched. That is elasticity. Blowing up a balloon also stretches it, but when the air is let out of a previously fully inflated balloon, it does not return to its original size. That is plasticity. With stretching training, one attempts to influence the plastic deformation so that

 a degree of elongation remains when the force causing the stretch is removed (

Plowman, 1992

). Flexibility is affected by neuromuscular disorders characterized by spasticity and rigidity, any injuries resulting in scar tissue, and adaptive muscle shortening caused by casting.




Flexibility and stretching are important for everyday living (putting on shoes, reaching the top shelf) and for muscle relaxation and proper posture. Flexibility is obviously important also for sports performance. How important flexibility is depends on the sport.
 
Table 20.1

 lists some popular sports and fitness activities according to the degree of flexibility required. The three degrees of flexibility listed are a normal range of motion, a slightly above-average range of motion in one or more joints, and an extreme range of motion in specific joints.




TABLE 20.1
 Flexibility in Sports and Fitness Activities








Note: If the skills involved with a particular sport do not require greater-than-normal flexibility, it does not mean that stretching exercises should not be included in the exercise program.


Source: Modified from Hubley-Kozey (1991).





Gymnasts obviously need to be more flexible than long-distance runners and cyclists. However, no definitive scientific studies directly link selected flexibility values with quality of performance in athletes who can move through the required range of motion (

Gleim and McHugh, 1997

;
 
Plowman, 1992

). For example, a bicyclist with normal range of motion in the ankle, knee, hip, and trunk will not become a better cyclist just by increasing flexibility in those joints.



Measuring Flexibility


The measurement of flexibility is not an exact, standardized procedure with a well-established criterion test. Direct measurement in the laboratory usually measures angular displacement (in degrees) between adjacent segments or from a reference point. Such measurements are usually performed with a goniometer or inclinometer.









FIGURE 20.14
 Instruments to Measure Flexibility.A.
 Goniometer. B.
 Inclinometer.





A goniometer
 
( Figure 20.14A)

 resembles a protractor with two arms, one of which is movable. The center of the goniometer is placed over the joint about which movement occurs, and the arms of the goniometer are aligned with the body segments on both sides of the joint. For a measurement of the range of motion at the knee joint, the center of the goniometer would coincide with the knee, the stationary arm would be aligned with the upper leg, and the movable arm would be aligned with the lower leg. The angle would be measured at the extreme range of motion for extension and flexion—that is, with the leg completely extended and completely flexed. The range of motion for this joint is the difference between the angles measured

.




Spinal and ankle movements are difficult to assess with a goniometer. For these, one or more inclinometers may be used (see
 
Figure 20.14B

). Inclinometers have a universal center of gravity as a starting point. To use an inclinometer, the instrument is held by the tester and zeroed at the standard starting position for any given joint. The participant then bends the joint through its ROM. For example, for cervical flexion, the inclinometer would be placed on the top of the head; the participant would then slowly bend the chin toward the chest. The inclinometer’s final reading (the angle at which the inclinometer is situated relative to the starting universal line of gravity) is the ROM measurement. Both mechanical and electronic inclinometers are available.




Flexibility measurements can be made passively, when an external force causes the movement through the range of motion, or actively, when the individual uses muscle action to produce the movement. Testers should note which technique is used because passive measurements are generally higher than active ones (

Plowman, 1992

).




Field methods for measuring flexibility typically involve linear distances between segments or from an external object. Variations of the stand or sit-and-reach test are the most popular field test of flexibility. To perform the sit-and-reach test, the individual sits with one (now recommended) or both (previously used) stockinged feet flat against a testing box. The hands are positioned fully extended from the shoulders onto a scale on top of the testing box. The individual flexes as far forward as possible in a controlled fashion, sliding the fingertips along the scale. The point of maximum reach is recorded.




From the mid-1940s until the mid-1980s, the stand or sit-and-reach test was described as a test of low-back (lumbar) and hip (hamstring) flexibility, mobility, or extensibility. In the mid- to late 1980s, several studies were published showing clearly that although the stand or sit-and-reach test is a valid test of hamstring flexibility, it is
 not
 a valid test of low-back flexibility (

Biering-Sorensen, 1984

;
 
Jackson and Baker, 1986

;
 
Jackson and Langford, 1989

;
 
Kippers and Parker, 1987

;
 
Nicolaisen and Jorgensen, 1985

). A recent meta-analysis of 34 separate studies (

Mayorga-Vega, Merino-Marban, and Viciana, 2014

) has confirmed these early individual findings.




Because of its widespread use as the only flexibility test in physical fitness test batteries, the sit-and-reach test has often been misinterpreted as a measure of total body flexibility. That is, if an individual has good flexibility in this test, equally good flexibility is assumed in other joint-muscle units. Although this idea is appealing in terms of simplicity and ease of testing, it is not accurate (

Clarke, 1975

;
 
Shephard et al., 1990

). Joint flexibility is highly specific to individual locations; it is not a general trait common to all joints. Therefore, if the goal of testing is to determine whether an individual is flexible, a profile of major joints must be compiled because no one test indicates total body flexibility (

de Araújo, 2004

). Joint specificity for flexibility is true throughout the age span of childhood to old age.



The Influence of Sex and Age on Flexibility


Male-Female Comparisons


The specificity of flexibility to each joint makes it difficult to generalize about sex differences. One study has shown that across the entire age spectrum from 10 to 75 years, males exhibited greater anterior trunk flexion (also called lumbar mobility or low-back flexibility) than females (Figure 20.15A
). Conversely, across most of the same age span, females exhibited greater right lateral trunk flexibility than males (Figure 20.15B
). Although not shown in this figure, females also had greater left lateral flexibility than males, at least in adults.

 Flexibility in Males and Females.

The differences graphed in
 
Figure 20.15A

 and
 
B

 did not reach statistical significance at all ages and/or were not always tested for significance, so it may be that there really aren’t any differences in flexibility between the sexes. Either way, these observations contradict the usual assumption that females are more flexible than males. Other data have shown that adult males are more flexible than adult females in trunk extension (

Moll and Wright, 1971

) and left and right trunk rotation (

Gomez et al., 1991

). However, adult males and females do not significantly differ in trunk flexion, trunk extension, left or right lateral trunk flexion (

Gomez et al., 1991

), left or right head rotation, external shoulder rotation, or plantar or dorsi ankle flexion. Adult males are less flexible than adult females in internal shoulder rotation and hip flexion (

Sullivan et al., 1992

).




The often-stated but apparently insupportable assumption that females are more flexible than males can probably be attributed to results from the sit-and-reach test. Because studies have shown that females have greater hip flexibility (

Shephard et al., 1990

), females would be expected to score better than males on the sit-and-reach test.
 
Figure 20.16

 clearly shows that from 5 to 18 years, girls do have a higher sit-and-reach score than boys.

Despite the sit-and-reach results, the results of many other studies show there is no consistent generalized pattern of sex differences in flexibility. Depending on which joint is being measured, females may have a larger, equal, or smaller range of motion than males.



Influence of Age


The impact of age on flexibility is only slightly less confusing. Figure 20.15A
 and B
 illustrates specificity through the pubertal growth years. The general trend is for lumbar flexibility to decrease between 10 and 15 years of age, while lateral flexion generally increases during the same period. The sit-and-reach data (Figure 20.16
) show an interaction of age and sex (Malina and Bouchard, 1991
). Basically, girls show a consistent improvement from age 5 to 18 years, while boys show a U-shaped response—that is, a gradual decline from age 5 to 13 years and then an improvement from 13 to 18 years, such that they are more flexible in the hip and posterior thigh by adulthood. Whether and how range of motion changes through the growing years is therefore joint specific
.



Although
 
Figure 20.15

 shows a pattern of declining flexibility as people progress from young adulthood through middle age and into old age, other studies investigating different joints suggest that flexibility does not change (

Gomez et al., 1991

;
 
Shephard et al., 1990

). An increase in range of motion with age through the adult years has not been shown to occur without training. Therefore, flexibility either declines or stays the same through the adult years. This is probably joint specific in terms of both direction and magnitude. Changes in flexibility with aging may also be confounded by the decreasing activity that often accompanies aging. Most flexibility studies are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, and this information has not been analyzed taking activity level into account.




All ages appear to be trainable in terms of flexibility (

Clarke, 1975

;
 
Rider and Daly, 1991

). This adaptation may be especially important to the elderly, for whom healthy, independent living is at stake.



Flexibility and Low Back Pain


The theoretical link between muscle function and low back pain (LBP) was described in Chapter 19
 (Table 19.5
), with particular emphasis there on muscle strength and endurance. Here, the emphasis is on the flexibility needs for a healthy, well-functioning back. Flexibility of the low-back and hip area and strong and balanced lumbar, hamstrings, and hip flexor muscles are crucial for controlled pelvic movement. Controlled pelvic movement means having neither an exaggerated anterior tilt (lordotic curve) nor a restricted anterior tilt (no low-back curvature). Either an exaggerated or a restricted pelvic tilt can increase vertebral disc compression and cause pain and strain in the low-back area
.



Research shows that individuals suffering from LBP have less range of motion, particularly in the low-back and hamstring areas. As with the reduced strength and endurance, however, these differences are more likely the result of LBP than a cause of it.




One study found that first-time low back pain could be predicted from lumbar flexibility (

 Jackson and Baker, 1986

). However, in this study, high lumbar flexibility predicted LBP, not low flexibility, as might be expected, and it was predictive only in males. On the other hand, recurrent LBP has been found to be predictable from both low lumbar extension (not flexion) range of motion and low hamstring flexibility (

Biering-Sorensen, 1984

).




What exact values constitute too low or too high a range of motion are unknown. From the existing research, however, it can be recommended that flexibility of the hip, low back, and hamstrings be part of a general overall fitness program. Flexibility should be developed specifically for athletes as needed. However, flexibility should not be taken to extremes, nor should one expect that flexibility will mean absolute protection from LBP.



Stretching Techniques to Improve Flexibility


The biggest decision in setting up a flexibility training program
 is choosing a stretching technique. Four techniques have been used to increase flexibility: ballistic stretching, dynamic stretching, static stretching, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). Ballistic stretching (BS)
, characterized by an action-reaction bouncing motion, is a form of stretching in which the joints involved are moved to the extremes of the joint range of motion by fast, active contractions of agonistic muscle groups. As a result, the antagonistic muscles are stretched quickly and forced to elongate. This quick stretch distorts the intrafusal fibers of the neuromuscular spindle and activates the annulospiral nerve endings, which transmit an impulse to the spinal cord, resulting in an immediate strong reflex contraction (the myotatic reflex) of the muscles that had been stretched (Etnyre and Lee, 1987
). This rebound bounce is proportional in force and distance to the original move. Although ballistic action occurs frequently in sports—for example, punting a football or a high kick in dance—and although ballistic stretching has been shown to be effective in increasing flexibility, this type of stretching is generally not recommended. Ballistic stretching may cause muscle soreness. In addition, although virtually no research or clinical evidence supports this, some fear that the forces generated by the series of pulls will exceed the extensibility limits of involved tissues and cause injury (Shellock and Prentice, 1985
). Fortunately, alternative means of increasing flexibility do not invoke this (real or imagined) fear of injury.





Ballistic Stretching
 A form of stretching, characterized by an action-reaction bouncing motion, in which the involved joints are placed into an extreme range of motion by fast, active contractions of agonistic muscle groups.



Dynamic Stretching
 A form of stretching that involves moving the limb from its neutral position to its end range, where muscles are at their greatest length, and then moving the limb back to its original position in a smooth, controlled manner.



Static Stretching
 A form of stretching in which the muscle to be stretched is slowly put into a position of controlled maximal or near-maximal stretch by contraction of the opposing muscle group and held for 30–60 seconds.



Myoclonus
 A twitching or spasm in a maximally stretched muscle group.



Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF)
 A stretching technique in which the muscle to be stretched is first contracted maximally. The muscle is then relaxed and either is actively stretched by contraction of the opposing muscle or is passively stretched.





Dynamic stretching (DS)
 involves moving the limb from its neutral position to its end range, where the muscles are at their greatest length, and then moving the limb back to its original position in a smooth, controlled manner for a specified time period. Typically, dynamic stretching consists of functional-based exercises, which use sports-specific movements that often work on balance at the same time utilizing both concentric and eccentric contractions. Dynamic stretching has the advantage of allowing for a similarity between the stretching and exercise movement patterns without the rebound from the forceful activation of the neuromuscular spindle brought about by ballistic stretching. Conversely, it does not benefit from the relaxation brought about by the firing of the Golgi Tendon Organ as the movement is never stopped and held. However, the static component of the neuromuscular spindle that opposes excess lengthening and the feedback of sensory information to the cerebellum from the GTO that smooths the beginning and ending of each movement should occur. Dynamic stretching can elevate core temperature with all the positive physiological benefits of increased nerve conduction velocity, increased muscle compliance, decreased inhibition of antagonistic muscles, increased enzyme activity, and accelerated energy production that result (

Behm et al., 2016a

,
 
b

). Examples of dynamic stretching activities include forward, backward and side lunges, inchworm, and arm circles. Many of these stretches can be performed either stationary or moving.




Static stretching (SS)
 is a form of stretching in which the muscle to be stretched (the antagonist) is slowly put into a position of controlled maximal or near-maximal stretch. The position is held for 10–30 seconds. Because the rate of change in muscle length is slow as the individual gets into position and then stops as the position is held, the annulospiral nerve endings of the neuromuscular spindle (NMS) are not stimulated to fire, and a strong reflex contraction does not occur. That is, the dynamic phase of the NMS response is bypassed. Instead, if the stretch continues for at least 6 seconds, the Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) respond, leading to the inverse myotatic reflex and causing relaxation in the stretched muscle group. This response is called
 autogenic inhibition
 (

Etnyre and Lee, 1987

). This relaxation is easily felt by the exerciser, and it allows the muscle to be elongated

 even further. The impulses from the GTO can override the weaker static response impulses coming from the NMS to allow this reflex relaxation and a continuous sustained stretch. If a maximal stretch is held long enough, the muscle being stretched ultimately reaches a point of
 myoclonus
—twitching or spasm in the muscle group—indicating the endpoint of an effective stretch. Because no uncontrolled sudden forces are involved, injury is unlikely with this type of stretch (

Shellock and Prentice, 1985

).




Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)
 is a stretching technique in which the muscle to be stretched is first contracted maximally. The muscle is then relaxed and is either actively stretched by contraction of the opposing muscle or is passively stretched by an outside force. A number of different proprioceptive neuromuscular techniques are currently being used for stretching, but the two most popular are the contract-relax (CR) and contract-relax-agonist-contract (CRAC) techniques. In both the CR and CRAC techniques, the muscle to be stretched (the antagonist) is first placed in a position of maximal stretch by action of the agonist and then is contracted maximally, using either a dynamic concentric or static contraction. Both techniques also require the assistance of a partner or an implement to provide resistance and elongation.




The contraction phase, which originates from the position of maximal stretch, typically lasts for 6–10 seconds. Because of the slow rate of change of the muscle length as the individual gets to the maximal stretch position, the annulospiral nerve endings of the NMS are not stimulated to fire, and no reflex contraction occurs. As with a static stretch, the dynamic phase of the NMS response is bypassed. The exerciser then contracts the antagonists against the resistance provided by a partner. As tension is created in the muscle by the maximal contraction, the Golgi tendon organs respond and the inverse myotatic reflex is initiated, causing a relaxation in the stretched muscle group (

Etnyre and Lee, 1987

). At this point in the CR technique, the partner who has been resisting the contraction moves the relaxed limb into a greater stretch and holds it for 10–30 seconds. That is, the antagonist is further elongated passively until resistance to the stretch is again felt.




In the CRAC technique, the exerciser actively contracts the agonist to assist the stretching of the antagonist. By reciprocal inhibition, the contraction of the agonist is thought to aid in the relaxation of the antagonist, allowing it to be stretched further. PNF stretching carries some risk of injury if the partner attempts to push the relaxed limb too far. However, if the partner stops at the point of myoclonus, which can be easily felt with proper hand placement, injury should be avoided.




The role of the Golgi tendon organ in bringing about an inhibitory relaxation of stretched muscle has generally been supported by research studies (

Etnyre and Abraham, 1988

;
 
Etnyre and Lee, 1987

;
 
Hutton, 1992

). When needle electrodes were implanted in the stretched muscles, very little EMG activity was recorded, indicating relaxation.

TABLE 20.2
 Summary of Stretching Techniques








Note: ROM, range of motion.





1.
 Ballistic: stand with your feet shoulder’s width apart, legs straight, and quickly attempt to place your palms (or if that is easy, your elbows) on the floor. You should bounce back up, but might not have if you didn’t go down forcefully because you didn’t want to pull your hamstring. Review the action of the NMS in your mind.




2.
 Dynamic: assume a full push-up position. Walk your feet to your hands, keeping your legs straight. Walk your hands out to the push-up position again in inchworm fashion. Continue for 10 yards.




3.
 Static: stand up with your feet shoulder’s width apart, legs straight, and bend over at the waist with your head and arms dangling down. Hold that position until you feel your hamstring muscles relax and allow you to bend even further. Repeat until your hamstrings start to quiver (myoclonus) or you can’t go any further. If you can easily touch the floor initially, stand on a stable box that allows you to reach beyond your feet. Think about the interaction of the GTO and NMS.




4.
 Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation: lie supine on the floor and place a towel around the heel of one foot so that you can pull on it. Elevate that leg straight until you feel resistance. Statically, contract the hamstrings for 6 seconds against the resistance being provided by your towel. Then pull on the towel with your arms to further stretch the hamstrings. This is the CR PNF technique. From the new position, repeat the static contraction for another 10 seconds. This time, stretch the hamstrings by actively contracting the quadriceps of that leg. This is the CRAC PNF technique. Think about the interaction of the NMS, GTO, and reciprocal inhibition needed to perform these actions.

Acute Physiological Response to Stretching




Coaches and exercise professionals often recommend stretching before activity to improve performance, prevent injury, and prevent delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Unfortunately, these recommendations, though common, are not entirely based on research evidence. This section describes the acute effects of stretching on flexibility, performance, injury protection, and the sensation of DOMS. The evidence may surprise those of you who are familiar with long-standing traditions in this area. As you read, it is important to distinguish between acute responses to pre-exercise stretching and a general chronic program of flexibility training done at another time in terms of positive versus negative responses or adaptations.


Range of Motion


The obvious and well-known response to an acute bout of stretching exercises is increased range of motion of muscles around a joint—an increase in flexibility. To achieve this, muscle relaxation actually occurs within the sarcomeres. Evidence seems to suggest that this relaxation is the combined result of a decline in passive tension that results from the mechanical viscoelastic properties of the muscle and the neural actions for the inverse myotatic reflex (Gleim and McHugh, 1997
; McHugh et al., 1999
; Smith, 1994
). All types of stretching appear to result in an increased range of motion, and no clear evidence suggests that one type of stretching (BS, SS, PNF) is better
 than the others (Behm et al., 2016a
, b
; Fields et al., 2007
; Larouche and Connolly, 2006
) with the exception of dynamic stretching. The ability of DS to increase flexibility is considered to be smaller than what is obtained from the other techniques (Kallerud and Gleeson, 2013
). Holding a SS or PNF stretch for 15–30 seconds appears to be more effective than shorter periods, but there is no apparent additional benefit for longer duration stretches. The increased range of motion resulting from an acute bout of stretching lasts for approximately 30–120 minutes (Behm et al., 2016a
, b
; Fields et al., 2007
; Fowles et al., 2000
; Power et al., 2004
).


Performance


Many coaches and exercise leaders suggest that pre-exercise stretching can enhance performance. However, the scientific literature appears to contradict this claim when the performance has a major strength or power component. This phenomenon has been termed the stretching-induced force deficit
 (Fowles et al., 2000
). Indeed, in 2006, the European College of Sports Medicine (Magnusson and Renström, 2006
) concluded that there was firm evidence that an acute bout of stretching could diminish performance in tests requiring maximal muscle efforts, and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM, 2010
, 2014
) suggested removing static stretching from a warm-up if strength and/or power were important to performance. It should be noted that the ACSM recommendation was based on references from 2010 and 2011. Now there is a larger body of evidence and it has been re-examined.



A 2012 systematic review (

Kay and Blazevich, 2012

) on the effect of acute static stretch (SS) on maximal muscle performance determined that in 149 findings from 106 articles only 44% indicated significant reductions in maximal strength-, power-, or speed-dependent performance with a pooled reduction of −3.7%. More importantly, there was a curvilinear relationship between stretch duration and the mean reduction. The magnitude of the reduction was −1.1% for less than 30-second stretch, −1.9% for 30- to 45-second stretch, −4.2% for 1- to 2-minute stretch, and −7.0% for greater than 2-minute stretch. The decrement did not continue to increase beyond 2 minutes. Thus, there appears to be clear evidence that there is basically no performance decrement in strength, power, or speed dependent tasks with short stretch durations. In general, where decrement was seen it was higher for strength-dependent than power- or speed-dependent tasks. Additionally, significant improvements in jumping, cycling, and sprinting performance were reported with short duration stretches. The authors concluded that SS totaling less than 45 seconds can be used in pre-exercise routines without risk of significant decreases in strength-, power-, or speed-dependent performance.




A 2013 meta-analysis (

Simic, Sarabon, and Markovic, 2013

) of 104 studies showed that an acute bout of pre-exercise SS decreased maximal muscle strength by −5.4%, muscle power by −1.9%, and explosive muscular performance by −2.0%. Further it was shown that the acute effects of SS were task specific in that maximal isometric tests were more affected than maximal dynamic tests. Finally, as with the Kay and Blazevich review, the smallest negative acute effects were evident with a stretch duration of ≤ 45 seconds. These findings were universal, that is, the same regardless of the individual’s sex, age, or training status. Acknowledging that SS also has certain positive acute effects during warm-up, such as increased range of motion and reduced incidence of muscle strains, the authors recommended that although the use of SS as the only activity during warm-up should be avoided, its incorporation into a comprehensive warm-up could be a practical way to minimize the negative effects while maintaining the positive effects on performance.




Finally, a 2016 systematic review (

Behm et al., 2016a

,
 
b

), acknowledging the shift away from SS and/or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching within a warm-up to a greater emphasis on dynamic stretching (DS), compared the effects of SS, PNF, and DS on performance. Data from 125 studies revealed a −3.7% performance reduction from SS, a −4.4% reduction from PNF stretching, but a +1.3% increase with DS in performance immediately (3–5 minutes) after stretching. As with the other two major reviews, the dose-response relationship again showed that longer static stretches (>60 seconds) were more detrimental than shorter stretches. However, in studies that conducted tests greater than 10 minutes after stretching, performance changes were typically statistically trivial unless extreme stretch protocols were used.




Taken together, these three comprehensive analyses have the same takeaway message. Short bouts of SS or PNF stretching (≤45–60 seconds) per muscle group per limb can and probably should be incorporated into a comprehensive warm-up (aerobic activity, stretching, performance-related dynamic activity) at least 10 minutes before training or competition. DS may be done closer to the time of the event.




There are several primary hypotheses to explain stretching-induced force deficit. One suggests that mechanical factors within the musculotendinous unit, such as decreases in muscle stiffness or a deformation in the connective tissue, may limit the muscles’ maximal force production. A second proposes that contractile fatigue caused by reduced blood flow and oxygen availability may be responsible. A third hypothesis proposes that central nervous system factors, such as activation of motor units or reflex sensitivity, is altered by static stretching in a way that impairs maximal force production (

Behm et al., 2016a

,
 
b

;
 
Behm et al., 2001

;
 
Herda et al., 2008

). The lack of stretch-induced force deficit caused by dynamic stretching is possibly related to the fact that changes in musculotendinous stiffness are not as great during DS as in SS or PNF. Conversely, the muscle contractions could induce post-activation potentiation (an increase in muscle force and rate of force development that occurs as a result of previous activation of the muscle) or be related to temperature increases (

Kallerud and Gleeson, 2013

)

.



Injury Prevention


Exercise professionals routinely recommend pre-exercise stretching as a way to prevent injury. The rationale for this is that stretching increases the compliance (decreases the stiffness) of the tendon unit and thus theoretically makes it less prone to injury (Witvrouw et al., 2004
).



However, despite this theoretical rationale and current widespread recommendations, the precise effects of preactivity stretching on injury are not fully documented. A recent review (

Behm et al., 2016a

,
 
b

) found only 12 studies that investigated the effect of preactivity stretching on injury risk. Neither static stretch nor PNF stretch showed an overall effect on all-cause injury or overuse injuries. There was an indication of a benefit in reducing acute muscle injury with running, sprinting, or other repetitive contraction activities. There was also limited evidence indicating a potentially greater effect of static stretching and PNF stretching on injury risk if the stretch duration was greater than 5 minutes total and it involved task-related multiple muscle groups. There was no evidence as to whether dynamic flexibility influences injury risk or not. Importantly, there was no evidence that stretching increased injury risk.



Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness


Static stretching has been advocated by coaches and exercise professionals as a way to prevent or minimize delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Unfortunately, the research literature does not support this contention. Meta-analyses investigating the effect of stretching immediately before or after exercise on subsequent delayed muscle soreness found that stretching had no significant effect on soreness (Herbert and Gabriel, 2002
; Herbert and de Noronha, 2007
). Similarly, although the number of studies is low, neither post-exercise PNF stretching nor dynamic stretching have been shown to prevent or significantly reduce the symptoms of DOMS (Krityakiaran et al., 2014
; McGrath, Whitehead, and Caine, 2014
).



In summary, acute stretching increases range of motion around a joint. However, research suggests that stretching immediately before exercise may result in force decrements that impair other aspects of performance. Stretching does not appear to prevent or minimize muscle soreness. Overall, the cost-benefit ratio of muscle stretching pre-exercise seems to favor muscle stretching in some form in terms of performance, range of motion, and injury outcomes, but the type of stretching chosen and the make-up of the stretch routine must depend upon the context in which it is used. That is, neither static nor PNF stretching is recommended if prolonged stretching (>60 seconds total per individual muscle) is conducted within 5 minutes of training or competition unless the necessity for an increase in range of motion and/or possible reduction in injury outweigh the requirement for optimal performance (

Behm et al., 2016a

,
 
b

).




Therefore, at this point it appears that pre-exercise bouts of acute stretching should not also be used as individual chronic training bouts for the development of flexibility. The best advice is to conduct flexibility training at times other than before exercise.





Application of the Training Principles to Flexibility Training




The application of the training principles to flexibility development has not received as much research attention as has the application of training principles to aerobic training programs and resistance training programs. Nonetheless, there is sufficient evidence of the health benefits of flexibility training that the American College of Sports Medicine recommends that flexibility training be included in a well-rounded fitness program (ACSM, 2011
, 2014
). Guidelines for developing a flexibility training program are given in the following sections.


Specificity


Flexibility is joint specific (Marshall et al., 1980
; Shephard et al., 1990
) and therefore is also task or sports specific. The first step in developing a flexibility program is to analyze the task or sports to determine the degree of flexibility needed, the specific joint(s) involved, and the plane of action involved. For example, hurdling requires flexion and extension at both the hip and the knee joints and also hip adduction, abduction, and rotation. Swimming requires the same hip flexibility as hurdling, but instead of knee flexion and extension, swimming requires ankle flexion and extension plus inversion, eversion, and shoulder flexion and extension, adduction, abduction, and rotation (Hubley-Kozey, 1991
). A general fitness participant should emphasize a total body workout of the major joints and muscle groups including the shoulder girdle, chest, neck, lower back, hips, posterior and anterior legs, and ankles. Although flexibility training has historically been used by dancers and a few athletes, it is becoming more common place (Figure 20.17
).









FIGURE 20.17
 Flexibility Training.





The response to stretching is not specific to the type of stretching performed or the type of movement that is

 to follow. How muscle and connective tissue are elongated does not matter as long as the elongation occurs. Because a movement will be done ballistically does not mean that ballistic stretching work should be done (

Etnyre and Lee, 1987

;
 
Hardy and Jones, 1986

).



Overload


Overload in flexibility training is achieved by placing the muscle and connective tissue at or near the normal limits of extensibility and manipulating the NMS and GTO by holding the position or contracting the muscle to achieve an elongation or by performing dynamic stretching exercises to the limits of the range of motion. A static stretch should be held between 10 and 30 seconds (ACSM, 2011
, 2014
; Fields et al., 2007
; Knudson, 1998
), except for older individuals where a 30- to 60-second stretch may confer greater benefit. PNF stretches with 3–6 seconds of contraction at 20–75% of maximal voluntary contraction, followed by 10–30 seconds of assisted stretch is recommended (ACSM, 2011
, 2014
). Dynamic stretching exercises are typically performed for 3–5 repetitions, 10 yd (3 m) of distance, or 15–90 seconds per set for a total of 10–15 minutes of activity (Behm et al., 2016a
, b
).



A high number of repetitions are not necessary for stretching to be effective. Two to five repetitions are frequently recommended for both the static and PNF flexibility techniques. A reasonable target is to perform 60 seconds of total stretching time for each flexibility exercise (

ACSM, 2011

,
 
2014

).




The intensity of the stretching exercises should be monitored by both myoclonus and pain. Although stretching to the point of feeling tightness or slight discomfort is good, stretched muscles that begin to twitch or spasm (myoclonus) are stretched too far and are fighting that stretch by reflexly trying to contract. Before proceeding, such a muscle should be shortened to the point where the myoclonus ceases. Pain also means the stretch is too intense; pain should not be tolerated. Both the rate of stretch and amount of force should be minimized.




The frequency of the workout should be at least 2–3 d⋅wk
−1
 in the development phase (

ACSM, 2011

,
 
2014

;
 
Sharman et al., 2006

). However, stretching 3–5 days a week is an effective way to improve flexibility, and reasonable daily stretching should have no detrimental effects. Indeed, daily stretching is associated with the greatest gains in flexibility.



Rest/Recovery/Adaptation and Progression


Short-term improvements in flexibility have been shown to occur after as little as 1 week of daily sessions (Hardy and Jones, 1986
). On the other hand, anecdotal evidence suggests that some people do not improve at all. At any rate, since the individual begins both static and PNF stretching exercises at the limit of extensibility and moves through their range of motion for DS, progression will naturally follow whatever adaptation does occur. Beyond this, methods to optimize progression have not been established. Most importantly, except in the case of specific athletic requirements, progression should not continue to extreme flexibility.


Individualization


As stated previously, the most important consideration in flexibility training is that the individual’s goals and technique preferences be considered. In a school program, the maturity of the individuals might also need to be considered. For example, if a PNF technique with a partner is going to be used, the partner has to be able to detect the onset of myoclonus and not try just to push as far as possible. Otherwise, individualization is inherent in the flexibility exercises themselves. Each individual stretches to his or her own limits at his or her own rate. Joint looseness is an individual characteristic (Marshall et al., 1980
).


Maintenance


Once the appropriate or desired level of flexibility has been attained, it can apparently be maintained by just 1 d⋅wk−1
 of training at the same intensity level. These data are based on a study that trained participants three times per week, using five reps of PNF stretching, over a 30-day period. Improvements in flexibility were maintained with only 1 day a week of training, although training three times per week resulted in continued improvements in range of motion (Wallin et al., 1985
).


Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


Little is known about when or even if a plateau occurs in flexibility training, although there will be a point, probably set by genetics, when further improvement ceases (Etnyre and Lee, 1987
). Improvements in flexibility have been shown to continue for at least 8 weeks after the cessation of exercise (Clarke, 1975
).


Warm-Up and Cooldown


Considerable confusion exists about the relationship between warming up and stretching before an activity and flexibility training. A flexibility training program
 is a planned, deliberate, and regular program of exercises that can permanently and progressively increase the usable range of motion of a joint or set of joints over time (Alter, 1988
). A warm-up and cooldown stretching program
 is a planned, deliberate, and regular program of exercises that are done immediately before and after an activity, with the intent to improve performance and reduce the risk of injury (Alter, 1988
). Considerable evidence shows that a flexibility training program can and does improve flexibility, and some evidence suggests that it may decrease injuries in some activities. However, as previously discussed, stretching immediately before an exercise may cause performance decrements even while improving joint range of motion if the stretch is SS or PNF ≥45–60 seconds.



SS and PNF stretching do not cause an elevation in body temperature and therefore do not constitute a warm-up. A cardiovascular warm-up to elevate body temperature should precede stretching exercises regardless of the reason for stretching. The warm-up increases body temperature and therefore makes the muscles and joints more viscous and responsive to stretch. Stretching in conjunction with a warm-up is likely more important and beneficial to individuals whose sports or activity requires greater than normal or extreme range of motion (see
 
Table 20.1

) but not maximal force production. Flexibility training should be done as a stand-alone activity after a warm-up, or as part of the cooldown where the structures benefit from the elevated temperatures of the work-out.




Elevated body temperature is believed to decrease the viscous resistance of muscle fibers and tendons, thus leading to increased range of motion. Increased body temperature is also associated with increased nerve conduction rate, which may be important for complex motor tasks or those tasks that require a fast reaction time (

Bishop, 2003

). Despite the fact that increased body temperature should make stretching more effective, studies have not shown that flexibility gains after 3–4 minutes of warm-up are any different from flexibility gains after 3–4 minutes of warm-up plus 20–30 minutes of aerobic work (

Cornelius et al., 1988

).





Adaptation to Flexibility Training




Improved Range of Motion


Stretching exercises and flexibility training improve range of motion, whether the technique used is ballistic, dynamic, static, or one of the PNF techniques (Etnyre and Lee, 1987
; Hutton, 1992
; Shellock and Prentice, 1985
). A recent randomized controlled clinical trial found that the current ACSM recommendations for flexibility training are effective for improving flexibility in young adults (Sainz de Baranda and Ayala, 2010
). Many studies have explored the question of which technique brings about the greatest improvement. All types of stretching are effective in bringing about changes in range of motion around a joint, but PNF stretching techniques appear to yield the greatest gains. Stretching programs using PNF techniques twice a week for up to 12 weeks have resulted in increases in range of motion of 21–32 degrees in long-lever hip flexion (Sharman et al., 2006
). The physiological basis of training-induced changes in range of motion is not well understood. It has been speculated that relatively permanent anatomical changes occur in connective tissue, but these changes have not been documented. Changes in neural sensitivity or simply an increase in “stretch perception or tolerance modulation” may be involved (Gleim and McHugh, 1997
; McHugh et al., 1999
; Sharman et al., 2006
; Smith, 1994
).



Despite expressed concern about the effect of resistance training on flexibility, little scientific or empirical evidence suggests that resistance training decreases flexibility. In fact, studies have shown that heavy resistance training results in either an improvement or no change in flexibility in some joints (

Massey and Chaudet, 1956

;
 
Monteiro et al., 2008

). Furthermore, competitive weight lifters have average or above-average flexibility in most joints (

Leighton, 1957

). So that flexibility is not lost, those engaged in resistance training should stress the full range of motion of both the agonists and the antagonists.



Injury Prevention


Muscles, tendons, and ligaments are the tissues injured most frequently in work and in fitness and sports participation. In terms of chronic stretching, there is evidence that 8 weeks of stretching can alter the viscoelastic properties of tendons, making them more compliant (Kabo et al., 2002
).



There are also data on flexibility training and injury rates. However, there is no conclusive evidence that high levels of flexibility or improvements in flexibility either protect against injury or reduce the severity of injury, including low back pain (

Hart, 2005

;
 
Park and Chou, 2006

;
 
Plowman, 1992

;
 
Shrier, 2004

;
 
Small et al., 2008

;
 
Thacker et al., 2004

;
 
Witvrouw et al., 2004

). Conversely, there is some indication that hypermobility, or loose ligamentous structure, may predispose some individuals to injury or low back pain (

Gleim and McHugh, 1997

;
 
Plowman, 1992

).




As described in the accompanying Focus on Research Box, some studies have found no decreased risk of injury following a stretching program, whereas other studies have documented decreased injury risk. Nevertheless, individuals with poor flexibility for the task they will perform probably have a greater risk of exceeding the extensibility limits of the musculotendon unit. Such individuals should work on improving their flexibility. Likewise, individuals whose sports may cause maladaptive shortening in certain muscles should perform stretching exercises to counteract this tendency. Individuals who are shown to be hypermobile need to concentrate on strengthening the musculature around those joints.



Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness


Muscle damage and resulting soreness and performance impairments are common in exercise and sports situations. As discussed in Chapter 18
, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is characterized by muscle soreness and stiffness that appears approximately 8 hours after exercise and increases and peaks over the next 24–72 hours. Because of the unpleasant sensations of muscle soreness and its interference with subsequent training and performance, there is considerable interest in finding modalities to lessen muscle soreness. As discussed
 earlier in this chapter, several authors have suggested that an acute bout of stretching may lessen the soreness associated with exercise—especially eccentric exercise. However, research studies have not supported the notion that acute stretching can attenuate muscle soreness. In contrast, a program of flexibility training has been shown to decrease muscle soreness and muscle damage (measured by plasma CK levels) following a bout of eccentric exercise (Chen et al., 2011
). Participants were assigned to a SS, PNF, or control group. Participants in the stretching groups performed stretching activity three times a week for 8 weeks. Both stretching groups improved their range of motion compared to the control group. Furthermore, both groups had smaller decrements in force production following the eccentric exercise than the control group and both stretching groups suffered less soreness. These results demonstrate that a chronic flexibility training program, consisting of either SS or PNF, may be protective against muscle damage and soreness.

Conflicting Views on Flexibility Training and Injury Risk




Prestretching Has No Apparent Effect on Risk of Injury




Military recruits undergo rigorous physical training shortly after enlisting in the service. The large number of new recruits in training makes this a good environment for a study investigating different strategies to prevent injury. In the study presented here, researchers investigated the effect of a stretching program on lower limb injury in a large group of male recruits who enlisted in the Australian Army. The authors randomly assigned 1,538 male recruits to a stretching or control group. During the following 12 weeks of training, both groups performed active warm-up exercises before physical training. In addition, the stretch group performed one 20-second stretch for each of six leg muscle groups. During the 12 weeks of training, 333 lower limb injuries were reported: 158 injuries in the stretching group and 175 injuries in the control group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. The authors concluded that typical muscle stretching performed before physical training does not produce clinically meaningful reductions in risk of exercise-related injuries in army recruits.







Importantly, however, the authors did find that a low level of fitness was a consistent and strong predictor of injury. In this study, the least fit participants (based on a 20-m shuttle run/PACER) were 14 times more likely to sustain a lower limb injury than the fittest participants. Thus, while pre-exercise stretching does not appear to provide much protection against injury, high levels of fitness do help prevent injuries.

Flexibility Decreases Overuse Injuries




Although it has long been proposed that increased flexibility is associated with a lower injury rate, only limited scientific data have supported this hypothesis. Decreasing the incidence of injury is important for obvious reasons, including the fact that injuries that occur with the initiation of a fitness program often cause participants to discontinue exercise. In the military, basic training is often interrupted because of injuries sustained during training. To test the hypothesis that increased hamstring flexibility would decrease lower extremity overuse injury in military basic trainees, Hartig and Henderson (1999)
 incorporated flexibility training in the scheduled fitness training of a company going through basic training. This group’s change in flexibility and subsequent rate of lower extremity injury were compared to another group (control group) that went through basic training at the same time. Both the intervention and control groups participated in 13 weeks of basic training program with the normal routine of stretching before physical training, including hamstring stretching. The intervention group added three hamstring stretching sessions (before lunch, dinner, and bedtime) each day. The stretching routine involved a partner holding the leg to be stretched at approximately 90 degrees, while the participant moved his trunk forward with an anterior tilt at the pelvis until he perceived a hamstring muscle stretching sensation without pain. Each stretch was performed five times for each extremity and held for 30 seconds. At the completion of basic training, the control group had increased their hamstring flexibility by 3 degrees, whereas the intervention group had increased their hamstring flexibility by 7 degrees. Forty-three lower extremity overuse injuries occurred in the control group, an incidence of 29.1%, compared with 25 injuries in the intervention group, an incidence of 16.7%. These researchers concluded that a simple stretching program that requires little time is effective in improving flexibility and decreasing the incidence of injury.

Given the conflicting evidence presented in these two studies, and reflected more generally in the literature, what advice should an exercise professional give about stretching before an event to decrease risk of injury? At this point, it seems prudent to recognize that stretching has not consistently been shown to prevent injury, but that there is some evidence that it may. However, the evidence clearly suggests that the application of the training principles, discussed throughout this text, is appropriate. In this case, it is particularly important to progress gradually, that is, to build fitness level progressively as a way to lessen risk of injury, and to accept that individuals may respond to stretching differently.









Balance




All human movement requires continual muscular adjustments in posture to accommodate changes in the center of gravity as we move. Even the apparently simple act of standing motionless requires a continual process of minute adjustments of body position to keep the center of gravity over the base of support. As with flexibility, postural control and balance may be classified as static or dynamic. Static balance
 is the ability to make adjustments to maintain posture while standing still, whereas dynamic balance
 is the ability to make necessary adjustments while the center of gravity and/or the base of support are in motion. Clearly dynamic balance is more important during activities, from relatively simple activities like walking to more complex movements like a balance bar routine. Balance has traditionally been viewed as an important component of sports-specific fitness, and in fact, many sports do require a great deal of balance. For example, static balance is essential in archery and other shooting sports; dynamic balance dominates in sports such as snowboarding, skateboarding, and windsurfing; center of mass control is important in climbing, figure skating, and rowing where a narrow area of support exists; regulation of center of mass movement in a predefined direction matters in ballet, dancing, and gymnastics; and side-to-side balance in sports games is important in injury prevention (Zemková, 2014
). However, balance is also an essential skill of daily living. Good balance is critical for preventing falls, a leading cause of injury and mortality among older adults. Some authors have therefore argued that balance should be included as a component of health-related fitness (Claxton et al., 2006
).

Dynamic Balance
 The ability to make necessary postural adjustments while the center of gravity and/or the base of support are in motion.





Balance is highly dependent on the nervous system and involves continuous feedback from visual, vestibular, and somatosensory inputs as well as rapid and coordinated activation of the muscular system. Postural control is a complex motor skill involving multiple sensorimotor processes. The two main functional goals of postural control are postural orientation and postural equilibrium. Postural orientation involves the control of body alignment and tone with respect to gravity, the support surface, the environment, and internal senses. This orientation relies heavily on sensory information received from the visual, somatosensory, and vestibular sensory organs. Postural equilibrium involves the integration and coordination of sensorimotor strategies to stabilize the body’s center of mass during both voluntary and externally triggered disturbances in postural stability (

Horak, 2006

). When considering factors that affect an individual’s risk of falling, it is important to realize that balance is a complex skill influenced by multiple factors. Not surprisingly, no single test adequately assesses balance, and probably no single type of exercise training can improve all components of balance.



Measurements of Balance


The most sophisticated laboratory measurements of static balance include the use of a force platform that can measure movement of the center of pressure (COP) and provide an indication of postural sway (Figure 20.18
). Software used with these instruments can calculate various parameters during a stationary balance test, such as area outlined by the center of pressure path, the total distance traversed, and the maximum excursion in a particular plane, which are assumed to provide an indication of balance (Hrysomallis, 2007
).









FIGURE 20.18
 Force Platform.A force platform can be used to measure ground reaction forces at rest or during movement. The force platform provides information about balance and gait, and can be integrated with EMG measures.





Clinical scales such as the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) also evaluate static balance. In BESS, three stances (double-leg support, nondominant single-leg support, and tandem or one foot in front of the other support) are held for 20 seconds, first on a solid floor and then on a medium-density foam pad. Eyes are closed and the hands are held on the hips. The number of specified errors for all six conditions is summed into a single score. Normative percentile data are available for ages 20–70 years (

Miller, 2012

).




Static field tests are also available. The most common technique is the timed, single-limb balance test. The individual stands one foot on a flat, stable surface with eyes closed for as long as he or she can without moving. Another technique to assess static balance is the flamingo balance test in which balance is assessed in terms of the number of trials it takes for the participant to balance on one leg on a narrow balance beam for 1 minute with eyes open.




Dynamic balance testing typically involves some level of expected movement around a base of support such as jumping or hopping and immediately attempting to remain as motionless as possible or reaching as far as possible without compromising a base of support. These are considered to be proactive tests. In a reactive test the individual attempts to regain balance following a disruption by an outside force of normal motion.




Reactive tests can be laboratory based. In this situation, an individual is put into a safety harness and with eyes closed begins walking on a treadmill. At some point, the individual is pushed from behind, an obstruction causes a trip, or a slippery surface causing loss of balance is encountered. In each case, recovery to a stable upright position is judged. If the individual is not able to recover, the safety harness catches them. Such manipulations can also be used as balance training (

Grabiner et al., 2014

).




The Modified Bass test is an example of a hopping test in which the individual is required to jump from square to square in a pattern somewhat similar to the old hopscotch layout but using only one leg. Hands must remain on the hips, and upon landing, the individual

 must look straight ahead and remain motionless. Error points are assessed and normative data are available for balance and landing error totals (

Miller, 2012

).




The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is conducted on a floor marked with a star pattern in eight directions 45 degrees from each other: anterior (A), posterior (P), medial (M), lateral (L), posterolateral (PL), posteromedial (PM), anterolateral (AL), and anteromedial (AM) (

Figure 20.19

). One foot is placed in the middle of this pattern, and the individual attempts to reach as far as possible, sequentially, in all eight directions with just a light tap on the floor with the other foot. The results are adjusted for leg length, and normative values are expressed as a percentage of leg length. The SEBT has been shown to be a reliable and valid dynamic test to predict risk of lower extremity injury, to identify dynamic deficits in individuals with a variety of lower extremity conditions, and to be responsive to training programs in both healthy people and those with lower extremity injuries (

Gribble et al., 2012

;
 
Miller, 2012

).

The Influence of Sex and Age on Balance


Balance improves as children mature. Both the sensory and motor processes involved with balance seem to undergo developmental maturation. The influence of proprioceptive function on stance stability has been reported to be completely developed by 4 years, whereas visual and vestibular influence reached adult levels by 16 years (Steindl et al., 2004
). Research suggests possible differences between the sexes in balance parameters in children. A study that investigated several balance parameters in children who were approximately 10, 13, and 16 years found that boys exhibited greater and faster movements in the center of pressure than girls in the youngest age group. Furthermore, the boys showed age-related improvements in sway parameters (Nolan et al., 2005
).



Balance, its maturational development and decline, is associated with falls. Children and adolescents have more falls that require medical attention than young adults (18–44 years) who exhibit the lowest rate but about as many as middle-aged adults (45–65 years) (

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012

). Older adults have an increased risk of falling, making balance a particular concern in this population. Falls are a common and devastating problem, causing tremendous amounts of morbidity, mortality, and use of health care services, including nursing home admissions (

Rubenstein, 2006

). One out of three individuals ≥65 years falls each year. One out of every five falls causes a serious injury such as broken bones or a head injury. Each year, 2.5 million elderly are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries; more than 700,000 are hospitalized. The age-adjusted fall injury death rate increased from 29.6 per 100,000 in 2000 to 56.7 per 100,000 in 2013 (226.1/100,000 aged ≥85 years; 59.0/100,000 aged 75–84 years; 14.1/100,000 aged 65–74 years) in the United States (

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016

;
 
Kramarow et al., 2015

). Adjusted for inflation, the direct medical costs for fall injuries are

 $34 billion annually. Given the dramatic effects of a serious fall and related injury on an individual, and the staggering health care costs associated with serious injury, decreasing the risk of falling has become a major public health concern. Good balance depends on feedback from the visual, somatosensory, and vestibular senses and relies on muscle strength, reflex control, and reaction time. With increasing age, a progressive loss of functioning occurs in these systems, causing the increased risk of falling (

Carter et al., 2001

;
 
Lord and Sturnieks, 2005

).




Studies investigating balance in adults routinely report that balance decreases as an individual ages (Carter et al., 2001;
 
Era et al., 2002

;
 
Holviala et al., 2006

;
 
Punakallio, 2003

). A cross-sectional study found that older adults (over 50 years) had a lower functional balance and higher postural sway balance than younger adults (<39 years) (

Punakallio, 2003

). A longitudinal study that investigated balance in a group of older adults at age 75 years and again 5 years later (at age 80 years) found that balance deteriorated markedly in both sexes. However, women in this study scored better on the balance test than the men at both points in time (

Era et al., 2002

). Underscoring the importance of balance, the simple balance test of having individuals stand with their eyes open was a significant predictor of survival over the 5-year follow-up period.







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






A Safe Exercise Environment






The diagram outlines how intrinsic factors (related to the individual) and extrinsic factors (related to the environment) may influence the risk of falling and the risk of serious injury from a fall. This figure distinguishes between impairments (the loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function) and disability (a restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range that is considered normal) (Schuntermann, 1996
).







Exercise professionals have a responsibility to do what they can to minimize the risk of falls and injury when working with any individuals, especially older adults or those at risk for falling. This requires understanding intrinsic factors that increase the risk for falling and being mindful of environmental factors (such as a slippery floor, poor lighting) that may increase the risk of injury.

Acute Physiological Responses to Balance Exercises


The vast majority of studies related to balance focus on long-term adaptations in the neuromuscular system related to injury reduction. The short-term physiological responses to a single bout of balance training exercises have received little attention.




Application of the Training Principles to Balance




Because balance involves the nervous and muscular systems and is influenced by flexibility and strength, balance training programs can be expected to follow the well-
 established training principles with important specific indications. Although there is more research needed in some areas, the following applications have been documented.


Specificity


There is some evidence that measures of muscular strength are associated with balance and falls. However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that balance and lower extremity muscle strength/power are independent of each other and task specific and should therefore be tested and trained independently from each other across the lifespan. Thus, if balance is needed, then, as with most physical fitness attributes, the training must be specific to balance.



Balance training programs may involve performing basic balance tasks such as alternating one-leg stands, standing on one leg with eyes closed, backward walking, and the use of a wobble ball (

Figure 20.20

). Balance training may also use a specialized training aid such as the wobble board. The wobble board consists of a round section fixed to the top of a hemispherical section allowing for multiplanar movement. The wobble board is common in rehabilitative settings and has traditionally been used to help injured athletes work on strength, flexibility, and balance following a lower limb injury.










FIGURE 20.20
 Wobble Ball Training to Improve Balance.





Tai Chi is a form of training that employs self-initiated slow but continuous rhythmical movements and emphasizes multidirectional weight shifting, awareness of body alignment, and abdominal and lower extremity muscle function. Both cross-sectional and controlled studies have shown that Tai Chi can lead to improved functional balance, with a reduction in falls in older persons (

Li et al., 2004

). Pilates may also be used to improve balance (Barker, Bird, and Talevski, 2015).



Overload


Results from two meta-analyses (Lesinski et al., 2015a
, b
) indicate that an effective balance training program for younger (16–40 years) and older (≥65 years) individuals of both sexes is characterized by a training frequency of 3·wk−1
 for 11–15 minutes per session plus additional time for warm-up and cooldown for a total of 31–45 minutes per session or 91–150 minutes per week. Although data were insufficient to determine the effective number of exercises and sets for older individual, at least four separate exercises with a duration of 21–40 seconds in two sets for a total of 16–19 training sessions were found to be effective for younger individuals. Older adults benefited most from at least 36–40 training sessions. There is no methodological sound approach available for assessing intensity during balance training relative to an individual’s balance ability.


Rest/Recovery/Adaptation


There is no specific research information available in this area, but there is also no reason to assume that rest and recovery are not important for adaptation to occur.


Progression


It is essential to sufficiently and persistently challenge postural control during the course of balance training. Increasingly difficult activities can be achieved by narrowing the base of support (both feet side by side, to step placement, to tandem heel-to-toe positioning, to one-legged stance) and by limiting the use of sensory information (eyes open to eyes closed; standing on solid ground to standing on unstable supports) (Lesinski et al., 2015a
).


Individualization


As always, the exercises need to be selected to match the ability of each individual, and progression must be matched to the increasing balance exhibited by the individual.


Maintenance


Training-induced gains in balance are not stable in older individuals but appear to decline after 6 weeks of detraining. Therefore, it is recommended that participation in balance training be ongoing for older individuals to counteract age-related declines in balance performance (Lesinski et al., 2015b
).


Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


There is no research information on either retrogression or plateau on balance training. Reversibility does occur with detraining
.


Warm-up and Cooldown


There is a lack of definitive information as to whether balance training should be done before or after exercise and/or sports training sessions. Balance exercises are not typically included in general warm-up or cooldown activities beyond their link to certain flexibility activities. When balance training is conducted in isolation, both a warm-up and cooldown should be part of that training session (Lesinski et al., 2015a
, b
).




Adaptation to Balance Training




Balance training following the training principles outlined above is an effective means of improving static steady-state, dynamic steady-state, proactive and reactive balance, as well as performance in balance test batteries in older adults. Age does not appear to negatively impact balance adaptations when compared to young adults (Lesinski et al., 2015b
). There is similar evidence of balance improvement for measures of proactive and steady-state balance in healthy young adults but insufficient evidence for reactive balance. Favorable effects have also been shown on motor performance and injury prevention (Lesinski et al., 2015a; Muehlbaurer et al., 2015
). Athletes of different specializations exhibit an enhanced ability to maintain balance in the specific conditions associated with their sports (Zemková, 2014
).




SUMMARY





1.
 The spinal cord performs the essential functions of connecting the peripheral nervous system with the brain and serving as a site of reflex integration.




2.
 Voluntary motor impulses are transmitted from the motor area of the brain to somatic efferent neurons, leading to skeletal muscles via the pyramidal pathways.




3.
 Reflexes play an important role in maintaining an upright posture and responding to movement in a coordinated fashion. Reflexes are rapid, automatic responses to stimuli in which a specific stimulus results in a specific motor response.




4.
 The myotatic reflex is initiated in response to a sudden change in length of the muscle. When a muscle is quickly stretched, the annulospiral nerve endings in the NMS transmit an impulse to the spinal cord, which results in an immediate strong reflex contraction of the same muscle from which the signal originated.




5.
 The inverse myotatic reflex is initiated when tension increases abruptly and intensely and stimulates Golgi tendon organs; it results in inhibition of the tensed muscle group, causing relaxation.




6.
 Volitional control of movement can function at the level of the motor unit as well as at the whole muscle level.




7.
 Flexibility is joint specific, and the degree of flexibility is specific to the individual. Flexibility may be either static or dynamic, but dynamic cannot easily be measured. Dynamic stretching, static stretching, or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques are recommended to enhance flexibility.




8.
 An acute bout of stretching:




a.
 Increases range of motion




b.
 Does not adversely impact performance if dynamic stretching is utilized and/or static stretching or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching is limited to less than 45–60 seconds per muscle group incorporated into a comprehensive warm-up at least 10 minutes prior to training or competition




c.
 Does not appear to mitigate injury




d.
 Has no beneficial effect on delayed-onset muscle soreness




9.
 Flexibility training adaptations:




a.
 Include an improvement in range of motion




b.
 Have not conclusively been shown to protect against injury




c.
 May decrease eccentrically induced muscle damage leading to delayed-onset muscle soreness




10.
 Despite popular belief, scientific evidence suggests that resistance training is not detrimental to flexibility. In fact, studies have shown that heavy resistance training results in either an improvement or no change in flexibility.




11.
 Balance is an important fitness component of particular interest because of its relationship to falls in the elderly. Balance is both static and dynamic, and the type of balance is situational.
