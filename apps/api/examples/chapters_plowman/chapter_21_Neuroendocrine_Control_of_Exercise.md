Identify changes that may occur in a target cell as a result of the binding of a neurotransmitter or hormone to a cell receptor (receptor activation).






Describe the functions of the autonomic nervous system that relate directly to regulating the exercise response.






Identify the primary hormones involved in regulating the exercise response and describe the exercise response of these hormones.






Identify the adaptations that occur in the hormonal system as a result of exercise training.








Introduction




You know from your own experience that when you exercise, certain changes take place in your body. You consciously initiate the most obvious change—contraction of the muscles—by activating the nervous system, which in turn signals the muscles to contract. You may also be aware of other changes, such as an increased breathing rate, increased heart rate, and increased sweating; these responses you do not consciously initiate. Still other changes—fuel mobilization, enzyme actions, and energy utilization—also occur during exercise without conscious initiation, or even awareness of their occurrence. These changes are all part of an ongoing internal effort to maintain homeostatic balance. Homeostasis
 is the dynamic state of equilibrium in the internal functioning of the body. It is controlled and coordinated by the nervous and endocrine (hormonal) systems of the body. Furthermore, these two complementary and often overlapping systems regulate the body’s response to any disruption in homeostasis, such as the disruption created by exercise. The nervous system is the faster-acting regulator of the body, whereas the endocrine system is the slower-acting regulator. The two systems interact and overlap in multiple ways to support exercise. Because these two systems function so closely together, they are often referred to as the neuroendocrine
 (or neurohormonal
) system. While Chapter 20
 examines the role of the nervous system in initiating movement, this chapter addresses the role of the neuroendocrine system in regulating the body’s responses to exercise and adaptations to training. Because the neuroendocrine system controls body systems, including those described in this book (cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and neuromusculoskeletal), the basic principles of neuroendocrine control are critical for understanding the exercise responses, training adaptations, and the integrated nature of all the systems studied in exercise physiology.



Both the nervous system and the hormonal system rely on chemical messengers to communicate with target cells. While neurons rely on electrical signals to conduct messages within a cell, they communicate with adjacent cells via chemical messengers called
 neurotransmitters
.
 
Figure 21.1

 depicts the cells of the nervous and hormonal systems and the chemical messengers they use. Neurons are secretory cells that release neurotransmitters at the site of the target cell. Endocrine glands, or hormone-producing tissues, release chemical messengers called
 hormones
 into the bloodstream or another body fluid. These hormones, in turn, have systemic or local effects. Thus, a hormone can be defined as a chemical substance that originates in glandular tissue (or cells) and is transported through body fluids to a target cell to influence physiological activity.










FIGURE 21.1

 Chemical Messengers of the Nervous and Hormonal Systems.
 Both the nervous system and the hormonal system rely on chemical messengers to communicate with target organs. Neurons release neurotransmitters in close proximity to the target organ. Endocrine glands release hormones into body fluids (often the blood) and may have an effect on target organs throughout the body.







Homeostasis
 A dynamic state of equilibrium in the internal functioning of the body.



Neurotransmitters
 Chemical messengers with which neurons communicate with target cells of either other neurons or effector organs.



Hormones
 Chemical substances that originate in glandular tissue (or cells) and are transported through body fluids to a target cell to influence physiological activity.





The effect of hormones on target cells can be further delineated as autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine. Autocrine function refers to the action of a hormone on the cell that secreted the hormone. Paracrine function refers to the action of a hormone released into the body fluids that has an effect on a nearby cell, and endocrine function refers to a hormone released into the bloodstream that has an effect on target cells at a distant site. If a neuron releases a chemical substance into the bloodstream, this substance is called a
 neurohormone
.




The effect of chemical messengers (neurotransmitters, hormones, and neurohormones) on target cells is mediated by the substance’s binding to a receptor on (or in) the target cells. The chemical messenger binds to the receptor because of the complementary shape of the messenger and the receptor. Thus, chemical messengers bind only to very specific receptors. The messenger-receptor binding is known as
 receptor activation
. It results in one or more changes within the target cell:




1.
 Change in permeability, electrical state, or transport properties of the cell




2.
 Change in enzyme activity of the cell (altering metabolism)




3.
 Change in secretory activity of the cell




4.
 Muscle contraction




5.
 Protein synthesis

 Outline of Nervous and Endocrine Systems








Exercise as a Stressor That Activates the Neural and Hormonal Systems




As detailed in Chapter 1
 and discussed throughout this text, exercise causes a disruption in homeostasis and simultaneously creates the need for the body to increase oxygen and nutrient delivery to the working muscles to support the metabolic demands of activity. These needs are met by the joint action of the neural and hormonal systems. Understanding the neurohormonal response to exercise is necessary for understanding how the bodily systems respond to exercise or any stressor (Hackney, 2006
; Selye, 1956
)
.



Both the neural and the hormonal regulatory systems are involved in the stress response system, as shown in the schematic outline in
 
Figure 21.2

. The primarily neural component is called the brainstem (locus ceruleus)-sympathetic nervous system pathway, shown on the left. The primarily hormonal component is called the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and is the pathway on the right. Notice, however, the overlap of the two systems. The
 hypothalamus
 is both a neural and an endocrine organ, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system stimulates many target organs by direct innervation and causes the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla. When the individual encounters a stressor, the hypothalamus coordinates the response. As both a neural structure and an endocrine gland, the hypothalamus orchestrates the body’s response by stimulating both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine glands.










FIGURE 21.2
 Neurohormonal Regulation of the Exercise Stress Response.
 The nervous and hormonal systems have multiple, and often overlapping, roles in regulating the exercise response. The hypothalamus serves as both a neural tissue (activating the brainstem) and a hormone-secreting gland.





The sympathetic nerve fibers originate in the brainstem and travel throughout the body to a variety of target sites. The sympathetic nerve fibers also go to and control the adrenal medulla. Norepinephrine (NE) is

 released by sympathetic nerve fibers, and both NE and epinephrine (E) are secreted by the adrenal medulla. The NE released from the sympathetic nerve endings and from the adrenal medulla is the same chemical. However, when NE is released by the nerves, it is considered to be a neurotransmitter, and when it is released by the adrenal medulla, it is considered to be a hormone. The NE and E secreted by the adrenal medulla circulate in the bloodstream to the target sites, where they mimic and reinforce the actions of the sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate these same target sites, for example, in elevating the heart rate. This response pattern is often referred to as sympathoadrenal activation. Both NE and E may also influence other endocrine glands, as indicated by the connecting line to the anterior pituitary gland in
 
Figure 21.2

 (

Chrousos and Gold, 1992

).




The hypothalamus directly regulates endocrine glands both neurally and hormonally through a series of releasing factors, sometimes called releasing hormones. In the generic stress response, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is released by the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which acts on specific target sites.




The following sections discuss the neural and hormonal responses to exercise separately in greater detail, but it is useful to remember the considerable overlap between these systems.





The Nervous System




The nervous system is a fast-acting control system that regulates an almost endless list of bodily functions. In general, the nervous system has three primary functions:



1.
 Monitoring the internal and external environment through sensory receptors




2.
 Integrating the information it receives




3.
 Initiating and coordinating a response by activating muscles (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac) and glands (including endocrine glands and sweat glands)




These functions are accomplished by the cells of the nervous system (neurons) communicating with each other and with
 effector organs
 (muscle and glands). Communication within a neuron occurs by electrical signals (action potentials). Communication between neurons or between neurons and an effector organ (e.g., skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, glands) occurs by chemical signals (neurotransmitters).



The Autonomic Nervous System


As described in Chapter 20
, the nervous system can be structurally divided into the central nervous system
 (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system
 (PNS) (see Figure 20.1
). Recall that functionally, the somatic nervous system
 innervates skeletal muscles and is responsible for controlling their contraction. In contrast, the autonomic nervous system
 (ANS) provides subconscious neural regulation of the internal environment of the body by innervating cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and endocrine glands.



The ANS has two branches, which work in opposition to each other through dual innervations.
 
Figure 21.3

 is a schematic overview of major body organs influenced by the two divisions of the ANS; organs directly involved in regulating the response to exercise are highlighted by being shown in color. The sympathetic nerves exit the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar region, whereas parasympathetic nerves exit the spinal cord from the cranial nerves and the sacral area. The
 sympathetic nervous system
 (SNS) supports activities associated with the “fight or flight” stress response and is vital in regulating the body’s integrated response to exercise (including increased oxygen delivery to the working muscles, fuel utilization in support of increased metabolic demands, and heat dissipation). The
 parasympathetic nervous system
 (PSNS) supports activities associated with “rest and digest” and is vital in the process of recovering from exercise. Changes in the balance of SNS and PSNS activity are responsible for many of the adjustments made during exercise and adaptations resulting from exercise training.










FIGURE 21.3
 Components of the Autonomic Nervous System.
 Sympathetic fibers exit the spinal cord at the thoracic and lumbar regions, whereas parasympathetic fibers exit from cranial nerves and the sacral region of the spinal cord. Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are longer than sympathetic preganglionic neurons and synapse with postganglionic fibers near or within target organs.




Neural Communication and Responses


Neurons are the functional unit of the nervous system. Excitation of a neuron leads to the generation of an electrical signal—termed an action potential (see Chapter 20
 for full discussion). Once generated in the axon, the action potential moves along the entire length of the axon, causing a neurotransmitter to be released from the terminal end of the axon. The terminal end of the axon communicates with other neurons, muscle cells, or glands across junctions known as synapses
. A synapse between a neuron and a muscle cell is known as a neuromuscular junction
.



The dominant form of synapse is a chemical synapse, which involves the release of a neurotransmitter from the neuron. (The sequence of events involved in the release of a neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction is detailed in
 
Chapter 20

.) Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter released from somatic motor neurons, parasympathetic and sympathetic preganglionic fibers, and parasympathetic postganglionic fibers (

Figure 21.4

). Acetylcholine is always excitatory to skeletal muscle, but may be inhibitory or excitatory to target cells of the autonomic nervous system (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle,

 glands), depending on the target cell receptors to which it binds. Norepinephrine (NE) is the neurotransmitter released by most sympathetic postganglionic neurons; neurons innervating sweat glands are an important exception. NE is also inhibitory or excitatory depending on the receptors to which it binds. Neurons that release ACh are called
 cholinergic fibers
; neurons that release NE are called
 adrenergic fibers
.










FIGURE 21.4
 Neurotransmitters of the Somatic and Autonomic Divisions of the Nervous System.
 Neurons of the somatic nervous system (α-motor neurons) release acetylcholine (ACh), which causes skeletal muscle to contract. Neurons of the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system secrete ACh. Preganglion fibers of the sympathetic nervous system also secrete ACh, but postganglionic fibers secrete norepinephrine (NE). Autonomic fibers innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands.







Synapse
 The gap, or junction, between terminal ends of the axon and other neurons, muscle cells, or glands.





The response of the target organ depends not only on the neurotransmitter but also on the receptor to which it binds. Receptors that bind ACh are called cholinergic receptors, and receptors that bind NE are called adrenergic receptors. The two types of
 cholinergic receptors
 are nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and the two types of
 adrenergic receptors
 are termed alpha (α) and beta (β). These latter are further subdivided into α
1
, α
2
, β
1
, β
2
, and β
3
 receptors (

Hall, 2016

). Because target organs may have more than one type of receptor, they may have different responses.
 
Table 21.2

 outlines the effects of the SNS and PSNS on selected effector organs. This table shows the general principle that activation of the SNS supports activities associated with the “fight or flight” stress

 response, while the PSNS is associated with the “rest and digest” mode.

Measuring Autonomic Nervous System Activity


Changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic activity have profound effects. However, autonomic responses are not easily measured. The most direct measure, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), measures electrical activity, typically in the peroneal nerve (located in the lower leg); this is an invasive method that provides an index of sympathetic excitement (Vallbo et al., 1979
). More commonly, autonomic nervous system function is estimated by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery from exercise.
 Heart rate variability
 is the beat-to-beat variation in the time of the R to R intervals on a standard ECG. A healthy heart rate is not fixed but rather varies moment to moment in response to physiological stimuli. For instance, in a healthy individual with a resting heart rate of 60 b·min−1
, the interval between beats is not exactly 1 second but varies in a range of different times that average 1 second. Heart rate variability is typically determined using a standard ECG and a computer to assess interbeat (beat to beat) interval duration over a specified time period. Lower variability reflects poor autonomic tone and is associated with a poor cardiovascular risk profile, elevated risk of coronary heart disease, increased risk of metabolic disease, and increased risk of all-cause mortality (Dekker et al., 2000
; Thayer et al., 2010
; Tsuji et al., 1994
; Wulsin et al., 2015
).






FOCUS ON RESEARCH: Clinically Relevant






Effect of Training Status on ANS Recovery






Exercise results in activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a shift in autonomic balance. The rate of recovery from this shift in autonomic balance depends on the intensity and duration of the activity and the training status of the individual. The quantification of HRV is a noninvasive tool to investigate changes in autonomic balance. HRV analysis can provide several useful variables, including mean HR, mean HR interval, and the root mean square of sequential deviations (RMSSD). RMSSD is often expressed as a percentage of pre-exercise values. A return to 100% indicates that pre-exercise autonomic balance has been restored.







As part of a larger study to investigate autonomic recovery from different exercise training regimens, Sieler et al. compared autonomic recovery from a high-intensity training session in highly trained athletes with recreationally trained athletes. The highly trained group (
n
 = 9) had a mean age of 23 years, HRmax of 189 b·min
−1
, and a
 

 of 72 mL kg
−1
·min
−1
; they trained an average of 14 hr·wk
−1
. The recreationally trained group (
n
 = 8) had a mean age of 27 years, HRmax of 189 b·min
−1
, and a
 

 of 60 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
; they trained an average of 7 hr·wk
−1
·Both groups performed high-intensity interval exercise on a treadmill. Participants first performed a 20-minute warm-up, then completed a 30-minute interval session consisting of 6 × 3 minute intervals at a velocity eliciting 95–100% of
 

 with 2 minutes of active recovery periods, followed by a 10-minute cool-down. The RPE associated with the exercise session was 18 in both groups.The figure below presents the RMSSD for the group of recreationally and highly trained athletes for the 4-hour postexercise period. The recovery of parasympathetic control after the intense interval exercise session was significantly slower (60–90 minutes) in the recreationally trained versus the highly trained subjects.








Highly trained subjects had a more accelerated recovery from intense interval work than recreationally trained athletes. This adaptation may be an important factor in the ability of highly trained athletes to tolerate typical twice-daily training regimens common among elite endurance athletes.

Heart Rate Variability
 The beat-to-beat variation in the time of the R-to-R intervals on a standard ECG.





Heart rate recovery following a graded exercise test is an easily obtained measure that is frequently used to estimate autonomic response to a challenge. Heart rate recovery is the difference between maximum heart rate and the heart rate after a specified time (usually 1 or 2 minutes) of recovery. The primary determinant of heart rate recovery is thought to be parasympathetic reactivation; thus, a faster heart rate recovery indicates a greater parasympathetic response (

Carnethon and Craft, 2008

). A delayed decrease in heart rate during the first minute after a graded exercise test is a powerful predictor of overall mortality, independent of workload, presence or absence of ischemia, and changes in heart rate during exercise (

Cole et al., 1999

;
 
Nishime et al., 2000

).



Autonomic Nervous System Control during Exercise


The role of the autonomic nervous system in regulating the exercise response is very diverse. As previously stated, the exercise response is mediated primarily through the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. In addition to direct nerve stimulation via
 innervation of multiple organs (see Figure 21.2
), sympathetic nerve stimulation leads to the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla. These circulating hormones serve to augment the response of the sympathetic nervous fibers that directly innervate various organs. As summarized in Figure 21.5
, the primary functions of the sympathetic branch of the ANS during exercise are to









FIGURE 21.5
 Primary Results of Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) Stimulation during Exercise.
 Activation of the sympathetic nervous system during exercise is responsible for many of the acute exercise responses.





1.
 Enhance cardiorespiratory function:




a.
 Increase cardiac output




b.
 Regulate blood flow and maintain blood pressure and blood volume




c.
 Ensure that the body can stop any unnecessary bleeding




2.
 Maintain thermal balance




3.
 Increase fuel mobilization for the production of energy




Autonomic nerve fibers innervate the respiratory system and the heart. Stimulation of the SNS causes a decrease in airway resistance (bronchial dilation), facilitating movement of air into and out of the lungs. Stimulation of the SNS also increases heart rate and force of contraction, causing an increase in cardiac output and an increase in blood pressure. The increased cardiac output is important for transporting fuel and oxygen necessary to support muscular contraction and for transporting waste products that build up as a result of contraction and must be eliminated from the body

.




Related to enhancing cardiovascular function, the SNS also plays an integral role in redirecting blood flow during exercise and maintaining blood pressure. These functions are achieved by controlling the diameter of blood vessels. Sympathetic nerve stimulation causes blood vessels (arterioles) in visceral organs, skin, and nonworking muscles to vasoconstrict (decrease in diameter). This allows more blood to be redirected to the contracting muscles to support their metabolic needs. Sympathetic nerve stimulation also plays an important role in maintaining fluid balance during exercise by causing the release of renin and antidiuretic hormone—two hormones directly involved in fluid balance (see
 
Chapter 11

).




Additionally, in response to SNS activation, the blood has an increased tendency to clot. This appears to be a protective mechanism associated with the increased risk of injury in situations in which the body is stressed. Furthermore, the increased clotting potential during SNS activation is balanced by an increased ability to breakdown clots (fibrinolysis) in healthy individuals. However, in individuals with cardiovascular disease, especially endothelial dysfunction, this increased coagulatory potential can be dangerous (see
 
Chapter 17

).




The ANS also helps maintain thermal balance by controlling blood flow to the skin and by regulating sweat glands. During exercise, particularly exercise performed in the heat, vasodilation of skin blood vessels facilitates heat loss by increasing blood flow in cutaneous vascular beds near the surface of the body where heat can be more easily dissipated. Sympathetic nerve stimulation also causes sweat gland secretion. Interestingly, the sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate sweat glands release ACh (unlike most sympathetic nerve fibers that release NE). The evaporation of sweat is the primary mechanism for heat loss during most exercise (see
 
Chapter 14

).




Finally, sympathetic nerve stimulation also helps to support the increased metabolic needs of exercise. The metabolic effects of the SNS are broad and include an increase in lipolysis in adipose tissue and an increase in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. Thus, both fatty acids and glucose are mobilized to support the working muscles.




In addition to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system described above, the parasympathetic nervous system is simultaneously inhibited in the immediate pre-exercise anticipation stage and during exercise. The inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system is often referred to as parasympathetic withdrawal. It is the withdrawal of parasympathetic nervous input that is responsible for the initial rise in heart rate seen with exercise and why immediate pre-exercise heart rates (such as might be taken before a treadmill test) are not accurate resting values.





The Endocrine System




The endocrine system, along with the nervous system, regulates the body’s response to exercise. Although many hormones have changed blood concentrations during exercise, this textbook concentrates only on those hormones that play a primary role in regulating the exercise response or training adaptations. The primary role of the hormonal system during exercise is to help regulate the metabolic and cardiovascular systems (Bunt, 1986
). Secondarily, hormones are involved in muscle, bone, and adipose tissue functions.


The Basic Structure of the Endocrine System


The endocrine system is composed of a series of ductless glands, other tissues, and the hormones they secrete. Hormones are chemical substances that originate in glandular tissue (or cells) and are transported through body fluids to a target cell to influence physiological activity. The major endocrine glands involved in exercise or training (Figure 21.6
) include the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas, and gonads (ovaries and testes). Other tissues that also function as endocrine glands and secrete hormones include the heart, kidneys, liver, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as endothelial and immunological cells. Hormones released from ductless glands are released directly into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body. Hormones released from tissue cells are excreted into the surrounding extracellular fluid, from which they may diffuse into nearby cells to exert an autocrine or a paracrine function (see Figure 21.1
). Although a complete inventory and description of all hormones is beyond the scope of this book, Table 21.3
 lists those hormones directly involved in regulating exercise responses, training adaptations, or other functions discussed in this text.









FIGURE 21.6
 Major Endocrine Glands.





TABLE 21.3
 Hormones Involved in Regulating Exercise






Activation of the Hormonal System


The hormonal system can be stimulated to release hormones (chemical mediators) through multiple pathways. Once secreted, hormone levels in the blood are dependent on multiple factors, and their biological activity depends on still other factors. The following section provides a brief overview of the activation of the hormonal system
.


SECRETION OF HORMONES Endocrine glands and tissues can be activated to secrete hormones in three ways: neural, hormonal, or humoral. Regardless of the type, the activation of an endocrine gland or hormone-secreting tissue always depends on a chemical signal. Furthermore, the synthesis and release of most hormones are regulated by negative feedback
 mechanisms; that is, the output (the hormone or a variable controlled by the hormone) shuts
 off the original stimulus or reduces its intensity. Negative feedback mechanisms cause the variable to change in a direction opposite to the original change, returning the variable to its “set point” and thus helping to maintain homeostasis.



Neural activation
 occurs directly when a neuron releases a neurotransmitter that signals the endocrine tissue to release a hormone. For example, sympathetic neurons release the neurotransmitter NE, which stimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones E and NE.




Hormonal activation
 literally means that one hormone (sometimes called hormone-releasing factor) stimulates another gland to release a hormone in a
 feed-forward
 control system. Hormones that stimulate the release of another hormone are called trophic hormones. The hypothalamus secretes numerous
 trophic
 hormones, including corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol (the long-term stress hormone). When hormones from one gland cause the target gland to secrete a hormone, which affects yet another gland, this is called an axis. The example given above describes the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis diagrammed in
 
Figure 21.2

.




The term
 humoral
 refers to blood or other body fluids.
 Humoral activation
 thus refers to stimulation of an endocrine gland by blood levels of nutrients, electrolytes, water, ions, or other factors. For example, the pancreas responds to blood levels of glucose (a nutrient) by releasing the hormone insulin. Likewise, the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands are stimulated to release calcitonin and parathyroid hormone, respectively, in response to blood levels of calcium (an electrolyte).



BLOOD HORMONE LEVELS The plasma concentration of a hormone depends on several factors including:



1.
 The rate at which the hormone is secreted




2.
 The rate at which it is broken down and removed from the blood




3.
 For some hormones, the effective, or biologically active amount; that is, how much of the hormone is bound to a protein versus how much is circulating in the free or unbound state




Hormones can be secreted in pulsatile (or rhythmic), circadian (day/night or 24-hour periodization), entropic (random moment-to-moment variation), or cyclical (often monthly) patterns as well as on demand. Some hormones act instantaneously; others require minutes to hours to days to have an impact. Hormones can be broken down and cleared from the body by the kidney, liver, or target cells. In addition, many hormones (primarily the steroids) circulate in blood bound to protein. However, to interact with a receptor, the hormone must be unbound, or “free.” In these cases, it is the amount of free hormone, not the total amount circulating, that determines the biological effectiveness of the hormone.




In addition to the factors listed above, hormonal blood levels are affected by disease, temperature, altitude, nutritional status, age, sex, exercise, hydration level, and training status.



EXTENT OF CELLULAR RESPONSE As stated earlier, hormones affect a target cell by binding to a receptor on or in the target cell. This binding requires complementary shapes between the hormone and the receptor. The hormone-receptor binding is known as receptor activation
. The extent of cellular response to receptor activation depends on three factors (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
):



1.
 The blood levels of the hormone




2.
 The relative number of receptors




3.
 The strength (affinity) of the bond between the hormone and receptor




Factors influencing the blood level of the hormone are described in the preceding section. The number of receptors on a cell for any given hormone can vary over time and in response to acute exercise and chronic exercise training. Hormone-receptor binding often destroys the receptor; as a result, replacement receptors are needed. High-affinity receptors produce a more pronounced hormonal effect than low-affinity receptors. High blood levels of a hormone may cause either an increase in the number of receptors (
up-regulation
) or a decrease in the number of receptors (
down-regulation
). Up-regulation increases the cell’s ability to bring about the hormone-specific cellular response; down-regulation prevents the target cells from overreacting to persistently high hormonal levels. Low blood levels of a hormone may also result in up-regulation. The more receptors, the lower the hormone concentration required to cause any given physiological response.



Mechanism of Hormonal Action


Hormones are divided into three general classifications: (1) proteins and polypeptides, (2) steroid-based hormones, and (3) derivatives of the amino acid tyrosine. Protein and polypeptide hormones include those released from the anterior and posterior pituitary gland, the pancreas, the parathyroid gland, and dozens of others. Steroid-based hormones are derived from cholesterol and include only those hormones secreted from the adrenal cortex (aldosterone and cortisol) and gonads (estrogen and testosterone). Derivatives of tyrosine include the hormones released from the thyroid (T3 and T4) and the adrenal medulla (epinephrine and norepinephrine).



For a hormone to bring about an action within a cell, it must first bind to a cellular receptor. Receptors may be on the cell membrane (often a transmembrane protein), in the cytoplasm, or in the nucleus of the cell. Once a hormone binds to a receptor on or in the target cell, a response is initiated. The sequence of steps from receptor activation to cellular response is known as the
 
signal

 transduction pathway

 or
 mechanism of action
. A hormone may exert its action through numerous transduction pathways; a full description of these pathways is beyond the scope of this text. However, as shown in
 
Figure 21.7

, signal transduction pathways may be broadly categorized into second messenger systems and gene activation pathways (

Hall, 2016

;
 
Marieb and Hoehn, 2016

).










FIGURE 21.7
 Mechanisms of Hormonal Action.
 Hormones may exert their effect on target organs (A)
 using a second messenger system (one example is shown) or (B)
 through direct gene activation.





Because they are lipid insoluble and cannot diffuse into a cell, many hormones exert their influence primarily through a
 second messenger system
. This mechanism begins when a hormone, known as the
 first messenger
 because it is delivering a chemical message from another tissue, binds to its specific receptor on the cell membrane. The binding of the first messenger to the receptor activates another membrane protein (e.g., G protein), which in turn activates a
 second messenger
 within the cell (e.g., adenylate cyclase). The second messenger initiates a cascade of chemical reactions (e.g., changing a protein kinase enzyme in the cell from an inactive to an active form) as shown in
 
Figure 21.7A

.




Steroid hormones and a few protein hormones are lipid soluble and diffuse easily into target cells. Once inside the cell, they operate by
 direct gene activation
. Lipid-soluble hormones enter the cell and bind to receptors either in the nucleus or in the cell cytoplasm (forming a complex that must then migrate into the nucleus). The activated hormone-receptor complex signals the chromatin portion of the DNA, a gene, to be transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA carries the code from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where a specific protein is synthesized (see
 
Figure 21.7B

). The protein produced may be a muscle filament or an enzyme that regulates cell metabolism.



Hormonal Communication and Responses


The hormonal system regulates and integrates a dizzying array of bodily functions. All hormones exert their influence by binding to a specific receptor on or in the cell. Several additional principles help explain how these hormone-receptor complexes translate into physiological responses that result from exercise. Figure 21.8
 summarizes these essential principles:









FIGURE 21.8
 Principles of Hormonal Response.
 A.
 Hormones bind to receptors because of complimentary structures. B.
 A hormone may have multiple effects within a single target organ. C.
 A hormone may affect multiple target organs.








A target cell may (and usually does) have many different receptor types on its surface (Figure 21.8A
). Furthermore, as noted earlier, the number of any given type of receptor may change over time based on cell needs.






A hormone may have several different functions within a cell (Figure 21.8B
). For example, when insulin binds to
 receptors on skeletal muscle cells, it may cause several things to happen, depending on metabolic conditions within the cell. These include an increase in the uptake of glucose into the cell, the formation of glycogen from glucose (by a process known as glycogenesis), or an increase in the rate at which glucose is broken down to produce ATP within the cell (glycolysis).






A hormone may affect multiple target cells (Figure 21.8C
). For example, when cortisol binds to receptors on the membrane of liver cells, it causes glycogen to be broken down into glucose through the process of glycogenolysis. Glucose levels in the blood thus increase, and glucose can be utilized as a fuel for active muscle cells and nervous tissue. However, when cortisol binds to receptors on adipose cells, it stimulates the breakdown of fats into free fatty acids and glycerol through the process of lipolysis. Thus, free fatty acid levels in the blood increase and can be utilized as a fuel for active muscle cells.






Interaction of Hormones


Many cellular responses require the joint action of many hormones. In a synergistic response
, the combined effect of the hormones may be greater than the sum of their individual effects. In a complementary response
, both or all hormones are needed to accomplish the task. Permissive
 hormones facilitate or potentiate the actions of another hormone, making their response more effective. In some situations, the actions of one hormone oppose another. These hormones are said to be antagonistic.




Role of the Endocrine System in Exercise




Exercise presents a physical stress that challenges homeostasis. In response, the neuroendocrine system, particularly the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reacts to help
 maintain homeostasis (Mastorakos and Pavlatou, 2005
). This section describes the hormonal response to exercise. The primary role of the endocrine system during an acute bout of exercise is to regulate the metabolic and cardiovascular systems, to conserve fluid, and to regulate stress-reactivity reactions (Bunt, 1986
; Hackney et al., 2016
). Exercise affects almost every endocrine gland, including reproductive glands, and endocrine responses to exercise play an important role in the adaptations to exercise training, including increased muscle size and regulation of body composition. The following sections primarily describe how the endocrine system helps regulate the metabolic and cardiovascular systems, with secondary emphasis on muscle, bone, and adipose tissue. Importantly, the hormonal system provides a major connection among various organs and tissues ensuring coordinated responses and adaptations to exercise. A full discussion of all the hormonal responses to various types of exercise is well beyond the scope of this textbook, but this is an important area of research that many students of Exercise Physiology may wish to explore further.


Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism


Hormones play a critical role in regulating metabolism by controlling GI tract motility and the absorption of foodstuff, the storage and release of fuel, and the metabolic activity of cells. The overall goal of hormonal regulation of metabolism is to ensure that metabolic fuels (carbohydrate, fat, and protein) are available continuously to meet the metabolic needs of the organism and that excess fuels are stored. Additionally, the hormonal regulation of metabolism ensures that blood glucose levels are maintained at levels necessary to supply the nervous tissue with required amounts of glucose. The challenge of maintaining appropriate blood glucose and mobilizing lipids and amino acids when needed occurs because we ingest food only periodically (typically 2–6 times a day), but the cells constantly need fuel available to support metabolic activity—and the metabolic needs of the body may change drastically, as they do with exercise.



The goals of the endocrine system relative to metabolic activity during exercise are to:




1.
 Mobilize fuel for the production of ATP energy needed to support muscle contraction




2.
 Maintain blood glucose levels (because neural tissue can use only glucose to produce energy)




Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, and cortisol operate together under the permissive influence of triiodothyronine (T
3
) to accomplish the first goal. Glucagon and insulin act antagonistically; glucagon levels increase, and insulin levels are simultaneously suppressed during exercise. As shown in
 
Figure 21.9

, glucagon, NE, E, growth hormone (GH), and cortisol affect three primary target cells: adipose, liver, and skeletal muscle cells. When these hormones bind to receptors on adipose cells, fat storage is inhibited and fat mobilization and uptake enhanced. When these hormones bind to receptors on the liver, glycogen (chains of glucose molecules chemically linked together) is broken down to glucose, and additional glucose is synthesized from other sources, such as alanine (an amino acid), glycerol, or lactate. When these hormones bind to receptors on skeletal muscle, stored glycogen is broken down to glucose. These hormones also cause skeletal muscles to increase their uptake and utilization of fatty acids, which aids in providing substrate for ATP resynthesis.

 Effect of Metabolic Hormones.
 Metabolic hormones affect adipose cells, liver cells, and skeletal muscle. The net effect of the metabolic hormones is to increase fuel availability
.




Hormonal Regulation of Cardiovascular Function


The goals of the hormonal system relative to cardiovascular function during exercise are to:



1.
 Enhance cardiac function




2.
 Distribute blood to active tissues




3.
 Maintain blood pressure by stabilizing fluid and electrolyte balance




Enhanced cardiac function and distribution of blood to working muscles are primarily accomplished by E and NE released from the adrenal medulla. These adrenal hormones reinforce the actions of the sympathetic nervous system (see earlier section on ANS Control During Exercise). In general, the two hormones have similar effects, but E is more important in increasing blood flow to skeletal muscle and the heart, and NE is more influential in causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure.




Two hormones predominate in the stabilization or maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance: antidiuretic hormone (ADH), sometimes called vasopressin, and aldosterone. These hormones act on the kidneys to increase water resorption and retain or excrete specific electrolytes (

Bunt, 1986

). By maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, these hormones positively affect blood volume and blood pressure as well (see
 
Chapter 11

).



Hormonal Involvement in Muscle, Bone, and Adipose Tissue


Hormones involved in the structure and function of muscle, bone, and adipose cells are not primarily responsible for the immediate goals of supporting acute exercise (although some, like myokines, may be involved). Many are important during recovery and generally facilitate training adaptations, especially changes in body composition (Bunt, 1986
; Kraemer, 1992b; Shai et al., 2015
); therefore, they will be discussed briefly. Tissue repair mechanisms are activated during recovery after all exercise sessions. Hormones that impact muscle, bone, and adipose tissue include growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors (IGF), testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and leptin. The role of PTH, calcitonin, and estrogen in bone health is detailed in Chapter 016
.



The impact of GH on protein synthesis in muscle is mediated through IGF. Growth hormone stimulates the release of IGF from the liver, and both muscle and connective tissue produce IGF. Specific effects of IGF include amino acid uptake, muscle synthesis, connective tissue (collagen) synthesis, bone and cartilage growth, and maintenance of fat-free muscle mass. Testosterone is responsible for the high ratio of muscle mass to fat mass that occurs in males at adolescence. Testosterone stimulates the release of GH and influences neural factors contributing to anabolic processes

.




Adipose tissue has long been thought of as a mere storage depot for body fat, but we now know that adipose tissue is also an endocrine organ that plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism (

Berggren et al., 2005

;
 
Galic et al., 2010

;
 
Greenberg and Obin, 2006

;
 
McMurray and Hackney, 2005

;
 
Ronti et al., 2006

). As shown in
 
Figure 21.10

, adipose tissue secretes a number of cytokines, specifically termed adipokines because they are released from adipose tissue, although they are chemically identical to cytokines released from immune cells. To date, several hundred adipokines have been discovered (BlÜher, 2016; Blüher and Mantzoros, 2015). Adipokines have diverse functions throughout the body.
 Adipokines
 are bioactive peptides released from adipose tissue that act locally and systemically through autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects. Adipokines influence multiple organs/systems and have a myriad of physiological

 roles, including mediating appetite (satiety), energy balance, and eating disorders; influencing insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism; helping regulate cardiovascular and immune function; as well as providing feedback that affects adipose tissue secretion and endocrine function.




The most prominent adipokine is the satiety hormone, leptin. Deficiencies in leptin or leptin receptors are associated with obesity (

Tomas et al., 2004

) (

Chapter 8

). Adiponectin is another adipokine and is associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Other adipokines are important mediators of inflammation and are discussed throughout this text in relation to vascular inflammation (

Chapter 15

), muscle damage (

Chapter 19

), and overtraining (

Chapter 22

). Adipokines interact extensively with the cardiovascular system and play a role in the regulation of vascular function, blood pressure control, and hemostasis (

Blüher and Mantzoros, 2015; Mishra et al., 2016

). Adipokines also affect the GI system, which releases gut hormones [ghrelin (stomach) and peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) (intestines)] that play key roles in regulating appetite (

Schubert et al., 2014

). An exciting new area of research is the role of beige and brown adipose tissue (see
 
Chapter 8

) in endocrine function (

Villarroya et al., 2013

). Historically, research has been focused on white adipose tissue (WAT), while recent research is now investigating the role of BAT in a healthy metabolic profile. Adipose tissue, including WAT, beige, and BAT, functions as an endocrine organ and plays an important role in integrating the functions of the neuroendocrine system, the immune system, and metabolism. These physiological links help explain the role of increased adiposity in the development of atherosclerosis, hemostatic imbalance, insulin resistance, and the development of the metabolic syndrome.

Hormonal Responses to Exercise




It should be fairly obvious that the action of most of the aforementioned hormones increases during exercise (except for insulin). Without an increase in hormonal secretion, the enhanced functions just described would not occur. What is not so obvious is the pattern of response seen in blood concentrations of each of these hormones to exercises of different intensities, durations, and metabolic demands. Recall that changes in blood concentration of hormones may not simply indicate an increase in secretion, because hormonal levels are affected by changes in clearance rates, blood volume, receptor-binding turnover, and other factors (Bunt, 1986
; Kraemer, 1992a
). The following section presents what is known about hormonal response patterns in relation to the six categories of exercise used throughout this text:



1.
 Short-term light-to-moderate submaximal aerobic exercise




2.
 Long-term moderate-to-heavy submaximal aerobic exercise




3.
 Incremental aerobic exercise to maximum




4.
 Static exercise




5.
 Dynamic resistance exercise




6.
 Very short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise




In many instances, the hormonal responses in all six categories of exercise have not been identified. In general, much more is known about long-term moderate- to-heavy aerobic exercise and incremental exercise to maximum than other categories of exercise.




Although it might seem overwhelming to consider how different hormones respond to various categories of exercise, it is important to appreciate the differences in hormonal response based on the type of exercise performed. Indeed, many of the metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses and muscular and body composition adaptations described earlier in this text are determined in large part by these endocrine responses.



Metabolic and Cardiovascular Hormones


Epinephrine and Norepinephrine (Catecholamines)


Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) are released from the adrenal medulla as a result of sympathetic nervous system stimulation. These hormones have widespread actions throughout the body and affect both the metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses to exercise. When interpreting the responses of E and NE to exercise, remember that NE is also released from sympathetic nerve endings. Because neural stimulation occurs more quickly than the endocrine response, the initial increase in NE in response to exercise is from the sympathetic nervous system (see Figure 21.2
). Both E and NE are later released from the adrenal medulla. In this light, it should not be surprising that NE shows an elevation at lower workloads than E and that blood levels are generally higher for NE than E (Galbo, 1983
).



The catecholamines are often called the “stress hormones,” and they have widespread effects throughout the body and play an important role in coordinating adjustments to exercise, particularly intense exercise. Cardiovascular adjustments such as an increased heart rate and force of contraction and vasoconstriction in nonworking muscles are accomplished by the actions of the sympathetic nervous system and augmented and reinforced by circulating E and NE. Catecholamines are critical to the control of circulation, blood clotting, and immune defense and thus warrant considerable attention.




Minimal increases in both E and NE occur during short-term light-to-moderate submaximal aerobic exercise (

Figure 21.11A

 and
 
B

). During long-term moderate-to-heavy submaximal aerobic exercise, the increase depends on time and is gradual if energy is supplied aerobically up to the point of fatigue (

Figure 21.11C

 and
 
D

). Incremental aerobic exercise to maximum elicits positive exponential increases in both E and NE (

Figure 21.11E

 and
 
F

), clearly indicating that a lower limit of submaximal intensity must be exceeded before a response is achieved and that above that point the increase in hormonal level depends on intensity (

Acevedo et al., 2007

). NE starts to spill out of organs by sympathetic nerve stimulation at intensities close to 70% of
 

. E and NE from the adrenal medulla are secreted at intensities above 80–90% of
 

 (

Borer, 2003

). The E and NE response to static exercise (

Figure 21.11G

 and
 
H

) is larger than during dynamic resistance exercise of equal heart rate or aerobic energy demand (oxygen consumption), and the rise in plasma E seems to be larger relative to NE than during aerobic exercise (

Galbo, 1983

). The response of E and NE to dynamic resistance exercise appears to be related

 to the force of muscle contraction, the amount of muscle tissue stimulated, and the amount of rest between repetitions (

Figure 21.11I

 and
 
J

) (

Kraemer, 1988

;
 
Kraemer and Ratamess, 2005

). Very short-term, high-intensity anaerobic work, such as in the Wingate anaerobic test (WAT), results in a large increase in both E and NE (

Vincent et al., 2004

).

Fluid Balance Hormones


Exercise causes rapid shifts in body fluid compartments, including a rapid decrease in plasma volume. Plasma volume may decrease by approximately 15% in the first few minutes of exercise, largely because the increase in blood pressure leads to an increase in capillary filtration pressure that pushes plasma into the interstitial space. Additionally, sweat loss during prolonged exercise can cause further reductions in plasma volume. Protecting against excessive fluid loss is important to maintain an aqueous environment for metabolic reactions, to maintain thermal balance, and to support cardiovascular function. Several hormones function together to help maintain fluid balance in response to exercise stress.



Antidiuretic hormone, released from the posterior pituitary, increases water retention, whereas aldosterone, released from the adrenal gland, increases salt and water retention. Thus, these two hormones act to maintain plasma volume. Aldosterone is linked with angiotensin II and renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted to angiotensin II, which initiates a signal for the adrenal glands to release aldosterone. Angiotensin II is also a potent vasoconstrictor helping to maintain blood pressure during vasodilation in working muscles. Thus, renin, antidiuretic hormone, and aldosterone work in concert to help maintain fluid balance, and thereby cardiovascular function, during exercise. (See
 
Chapter 11

 for a discussion of the hormonal control of blood volume.) Changes in renin, antidiuretic hormone, and aldosterone—known as fluid balance hormones—occur parallel to each other. They highly correlate with changes in NE and have similar time courses.

Metabolic Hormones


A number of overlapping hormonal responses help ensure that skeletal muscles can increase their metabolic activity during exercise. As discussed earlier, the catecholamines play an important role regulating metabolic responses to exercise (by increasing lipolysis, stimulating insulin, and suppressing glucagon). This section focuses on several other metabolic hormones directly involved in regulating the metabolic response to exercise.



The exercise responses of the metabolic hormones have been studied most extensively during long-term moderate-to-heavy submaximal aerobic exercise and incremental aerobic exercise to maximum. Therefore, what is known about the exercise response of these hormones applies primarily to these categories of exercise. Although plasma levels are presented for each hormone in the figures, keep in mind that changes in plasma levels may reflect not changes in secretion but rather changes in clearance rates. The responses might also reflect autonomic nervous system changes.



Insulin and Glucagon


Insulin operates to store fuel, whereas glucagon’s role is to mobilize fuel. Therefore, in general, the responses of these two hormones are close to mirror images of each other. The ratio of glucagon to insulin primarily controls fuel mobilization, however. Insulin has multiple actions, including increasing glucose and free fatty acid uptake and decreasing glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In contrast, glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and is important for maintaining blood glucose levels during prolonged exercise.



During short-term light-to-moderate submaximal aerobic exercise, insulin declines a small amount initially before leveling off, and glucagon rises a small amount initially before leveling off (

Galbo, 1983

). Long-term moderate-to-heavy submaximal aerobic exercise causes an initial rapid increase in glucagon followed by a gradual increase (

Figure 21.12A

) and a complementary initial rapid drop in insulin followed by gradual decline (

Figure 21.12B

) (

Galbo, 1983

). During incremental exercise to maximum, glucagon increases in a positive exponential manner. The increase in glucagon is proportionally greater as exercise intensity increases than is the decline in insulin (

Figure 21.13A

 and
 
B

). Indeed, at high workloads (>60%
 

), plasma insulin levels begin to rise again, resulting overall in a truncated U-shaped curve that remains below resting levels. Neither static activity nor short-term high-intensity exercise (such as sprinting or dynamic resistance exercise) appears to affect either insulin or glucagon much, because fuel demands for these activities do not require extensive mobilization. However, some authors have reported decreased insulin levels following a bout of resistance exercise (

Raastad et al., 2000

).

Growth Hormone


Exercise causes an increase in circulating growth hormone (GH) that is influenced by intensity and duration, fitness level, age, gender, nutritional status and body composition (Nindl et al., 2014
). As a protein hormone, GH has a slow rate of response, secretion, and clearance (Galbo, 1983
). Thus, there is a delay between the onset of exercise and changes in blood hormonal levels. The greater the intensity of the exercise, the shorter this delay is. Short-term light-to-moderate submaximal aerobic exercise and static exercise are too brief for any changes to become apparent. A short but high-intensity exercise causes a peak value in GH that may occur from 15–30 minutes into recovery.

Multiple Factors Affect Energy Balance and Adiposity






Exercise professionals routinely prescribe exercise to increase caloric expenditure (energy output) in an attempt to maintain caloric balance or to create an energy deficit (calorie expenditure > calorie intake) to decrease adiposity. Much of Chapter 8
 in this text is devoted to such issues. This chapter focuses on hormonal responses to exercise, including the hormones that regulate hormonal adjustments to exercise.







Below is a schematic illustration of factors that influence energy intake and output and their relationship to adiposity.








Exercise professionals prescribing exercise for energy balance must consider many factors. The accompanying schematic reminds us:






1.
 A large number of factors affect energy balance.




2.
 The various factors interact extensively.




3.
 Hormones have a central role in the body’s responses to exercise, in regulating hunger, and in influencing adipose tissue.




4.
 Adipose tissue releases adipokines that in turn affect other hormones, the exercise response, and hunger.



Source: McMurray and Hackney (2005)
.









Long-term moderate-to-heavy submaximal aerobic exercise leads to a gradual increase in GH over 30–60 minutes (

Figure 21.12C

) (

Galbo, 1983

). If the activity continues much longer, however, as in a marathon, GH concentrations return to near baseline levels. With incremental aerobic exercise to maximum (

Figure 21.13C

), GH concentration increases with increasing workloads in a positive exponential fashion after the initial delay

.




GH release increases during and following resistance exercise. High total work and short rest periods are associated with a much larger increase in GH than low total work volume and long rest periods (

Kraemer, 1992a

;
 
Thomas et al., 2013

). Similarly, exercise using large muscle mass results in greater elevations of GH than those using a small muscle mass. Research suggests that the metabolic properties of the muscle affect the GH response. That is, protocols that cause high lactate levels (e.g., programs that use moderate- to high-intensity and high-volume exercise that stress large muscle mass and that use relatively short rest intervals, thus stressing the fast glycolytic fibers) produce the most substantial increases in GH in both men and women (

Kraemer and Ratamess, 2005

;
 
Thomas et al., 2013

). GH response to exercise can be influenced by a

 variety of factors such as oxygen demand and availability, afferent signals from muscle metabolic receptors, motor center activity, catecholamines, and changes in core temperature (

Thomas et al., 2013

). Evidence also suggests that GH response is affected by menstrual state (normal cycling or disordered menstrual cycle) (

Nakamura et al., 2011

). Although research has consistently shown an increase in GH with exercise, researchers have also investigated the amplitude and pulsatile release of GH during recovery from exercise as this appears to be related to desired exercise outcomes such as decrease in fat mass (Weltman et al., 2008; Wideman et al., 2006). See Focus on Research Box for analysis of a study investigating the secretory profile of GH following aerobic and resistance exercise.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Growth Hormone Secretory Profiles after Aerobic and Resistance Exercise






Growth hormone levels increase with exercise, and the increase in GH is thought to play an important role in the anabolic and lipolytic actions that accompany exercise. In fact, many people engage in exercise training programs in order to increase muscle mass and decrease fat mass, and these changes are mediated, at least partially through GH. Thus, understanding the GH response to different types of exercise is of considerable interest. And, the effect of GH is not dependent solely on the blood concentrations. Rather, the structure of the GH molecule and the amplitude of its pulsatile release may be even more important than circulating concentrations. Thus, Nindl and colleagues undertook a study to document growth hormone secretion profiles during a 20-hour recovery period after aerobic and resistance exercise bouts. This study included eight healthy male volunteers who were recreationally trained and who participated in five independent conditions in random order:





1.
 Control




2.
 A moderate-duration aerobic exercise session (MA: 1 hours; 3 bouts of 15-minute cycling at 70% of VO
2
 peak; 5- to 7-minute rest b/t bouts)




3.
 A long-duration aerobic exercise session (LA: 2 hours; 3 bouts of 15-minute cycling at 70% of VO
2
 peak; 5- to 7-minute rest b/t bouts)




4.
 A moderate-duration resistance exercise-session (MR: 1 hours; 25 sets 5 or 10-RM/set; 90- to 120-second rest intervals)




5.
 A long-duration resistance exercise-program (LR: 1 hours; 25 sets 5 or 10-RM/set; 90- to 120-second rest intervals)






The accompanying figure shows the GH concentration peak profiles for a representative volunteer for each of the conditions. Long-duration aerobic exercise had the greatest effect on GH concentration. Statistical analysis revealed that only long-duration aerobic exercise caused a significant amplification of GH release.








The authors speculate that the increased GH release following long-duration aerobic exercise is due to the higher energy demands of this exercise and the greater demand for postexercise fat mobilization.

 46(10):1917–1927 (2014).









The effect of exercise on IGF is less clear than the response of GH. IGF levels may rise immediately following acute exercise; however, these findings are inconsistent (

Nemet et al., 2003

). Research has reported both increases and decreases in IGF concentration despite increases in circulating GH (

Kraemer et al., 1995

;
 
Nemet et al., 2003

).



Cortisol


Like growth hormone, the steroid-based cortisol is a slow-acting hormone. In addition to multiple roles in metabolism, cortisol has numerous biological functions throughout the body, as outlined in Table 21.4
. Cortisol is also considered a “stress hormone” because it mediates many responses to stress, particularly chronic or long-term stress. As such, cortisol is an important mediator of immune response to exercise (see Chapter 22
).



TABLE 21.4
 Multiple Effects of Cortisol on Various Bodily Functions









Source:
 Modified from Borer (2003).





It is difficult to generalize a pattern of cortisol’s exercise response because of the initial delay in exercise-enhanced concentrations and because in short-duration

 and/or low- to moderate-intensity activity, clearance of the hormone exceeds secretion. This means that although secretion may increase, blood concentrations actually decrease (

Sutton et al., 1990

). This outcome can be seen in
 
Figure 21.12D

, which depicts the response of cortisol to long-term moderate-to-heavy exercise. Work intensity less than or equal to 50% of
 

 results in a steady decrease in blood cortisol level, whereas intensity loads from approximately 60–90% of
 

 cause a gradual rise in blood cortisol level over time, despite a constant workload. The truncated U pattern for incremental exercise to maximum seen in
 
Figure 21.13D

 reinforces the importance of intensity in the cortisol response. Indeed, cortisol may not increase until anaerobic metabolism makes a significant contribution to the total energy supply. Anaerobic exercise causes greater increases in cortisol than aerobic exercise, even at the same total work output, probably because of the greater intensity (

Kraemer, 1988

,
 
1992a

). Further research suggests that greater intensity exercise, such as high-intensity interval training, causes a transient increase in cortisol and appears to promote anabolic processes (

Wahl et al., 2013

). Dynamic resistance exercise causes large increases both during and after high-intensity sessions, probably because of its large anaerobic component. Exercise involving large muscle groups results in greater elevations of cortisol than exercise involving small muscle groups (

Smilios et al., 2003

). Cortisol levels in the blood remain elevated up to several hours after exercise. Exercise programs causing the greatest change in GH (and lactate) also result in the most substantial changes in cortisol (

Kraemer and Ratamess, 2005

).

Thyroid and Parathyroid Hormone


The pattern of thyroid and parathyroid hormonal responses to the different categories of exercise is unclear (Galbo, 1983
). Numerous studies have reported no change in blood concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3
) or thyroxine (T4
). However, it is possible that free T3
 and free T4
 change without resulting in changes in the total concentration of thyroid hormone; this lack of change does not mean an unchanged turnover (Berent and Wartofsky, 2000
). Following long-term heavy aerobic exercise, free T4
 increases slightly, while free T3
 declines gradually over time, resulting in nonpathological hypothyroidism. It is believed that reduced secretion from the thyroid gland, reduced conversion of T4 to T3, and increased target tissue uptake may contribute to the exercise-induced hypothyroid state (Hackney et al., 2012
).



Similarly, parathyroid hormone concentrations have been shown to increase during endurance exercise, with low parathyroid concentrations present during recovery (

Scott et al., 2014

). The data are insufficient to draw conclusions regarding parathyroid hormone responses to different exercise intensities. Additionally, limited research exists in relation to calcitonin hormone responses to exercise.



Hormones Related to Muscle, Bone, and Adipose Tissue


Muscle


A single bout of resistance exercise leads to acute changes in the hormonal environment (an increase in catecholamines and IGF) that is linked to the cellular processes involved in protein turnover and muscle growth (Kraemer and Ratamess, 2005
). Muscle protein
 turnover is an important part of protein metabolism and is necessary for muscle breakdown (during exercise) and subsequent muscle repair (during recovery) (Crewther et al., 2006
). High weight, low repetition resistance training sessions cause large acute increases in growth hormone and the catabolic hormone, cortisol. On the other hand, high repetition, low weight resistance training sessions cause little or no change in GH and modest changes in cortisol. During and following high-intensity dynamic aerobic and resistance exercise, testosterone levels in men are elevated and remain so for a couple of hours during recovery. Prolonged endurance exercise results in an initial increase, followed by a return to baseline or below during recovery (Cumming, 2000
). Women have much lower basal levels of testosterone than men, and there are inconsistencies in the literature as to the extent that testosterone increases in women following resistance exercise (Enea et al., 2011
). There is strong evidence that menstrual cycle state (normal cycling or disordered menstrual cycle) affects resting testosterone levels (Nakamura et al., 2011
).



Recently, research has documented that skeletal muscle also acts as an endocrine gland and releases “myokines” in response to muscle contractions. These myokines act as autocrines (have an impact on skeletal muscle itself ), as paracrines, and as endocrines with an impact on the function of the liver, pancreas, cardiovascular system, and adipose tissue (white, beige, and brown). The most notable myokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serves to ensure fuel availability during exercise by aiding in the release of glucose from the liver and fatty acids from adipose tissue (

Nimmo, et al., 2013

;
 
Schnyder and Handschin, 2015

).

The Influence of Menstrual Cycle Hormonal Fluctuations on Physiological Responses to Exercise






Although this chapter focuses on the effects of exercise and exercise training on the neurohormonal system, fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle can potentially cause changes in exercise performance or the physiological responses and adaptations to exercise/exercise training. Current literature suggests that fluctuations in female reproductive hormones do not affect muscle contractile characteristics or 

 (and its determinants). Similarly, neither maximal strength nor intense anaerobic activities appear affected by the menstrual cycle. During prolonged exercise in the heat, however, the exercise time to exhaustion decreases during the midluteal phase (when progesterone is increased and body temperature is elevated) (Janse de Jonge, 2003
; Marsh and Jenkins, 2002
).







There is some controversy concerning the lactate response to exercise during various phases of the menstrual cycle that may be the result of different analysis techniques.









Forsyth and Reilly (2005)

 studied 11 endurance-trained eumenorrheic (regularly cycling) female athletes not taking oral contraceptives at the midfollicular (6–10 days after menses) and midluteal (6–10 days after the LH surge) phases of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual phase was confirmed by blood hormonal analyses. Subjects were tested at 06:00 and 18:00 hours on a Concept II rowing machine using an incremental test to maximum. Lactate threshold (LT1) was determined three ways: by a mathematical curve-fitting procedure, by the visual procedure shown in

), and at the fixed blood lactate concentration [La] of 4.0 mmol·L
−1
 (LT2). Ventilatory threshold (VT1) was also determined. At rest and a fixed exercise intensity, [La] was significantly lower in the midluteal phase than in the midfollicular phase. In the midluteal phase, LT at 4.0 mmol·L
−1
 occurred at a significantly higher exercise intensity, heart rate, and oxygen consumption than in the midfollicular phase. Blood lactate concentrations at VT1 and LT1 (but not power output, heart rate,
 

, or ratings of perceived exertion) using the mathematical curve-fitting procedure were significantly lower in the midluteal phase, but no changes were observed in any variable when LT1 was determined by the visual curve-fitting technique. The curve-fitting techniques provide information regarding the balance between lactate production and clearance. Below the LT1 threshold, production and clearance are equal. The glycogen-sparing effect of estrogen in the luteal phase likely causes a decrease in lactate production above LT1. This impact is masked when a set concentration is used for the lactate threshold.








These findings suggest that the menstrual cycle phase must be carefully considered when a fixed value of blood lactate is used to establish responses to training or even training load. Workouts linked to absolute lactate values may need adjustment throughout the menstrual cycle. When lactate thresholds are of interest, testing should be performed during the same menstrual cycle phase for each testing session. Alternately, use of the visual curve-fitting techniques should eliminate the problem.

Bone


Acute submaximal aerobic and resistance exercise results in elevated blood levels of estrogen and progesterone (Chilibeck, 2000
; McMurray and Hackney, 2005
). Kemmier and colleagues (Kemmier et al., 2003
) have shown that free testosterone, estradiol, and GH increase as a result of a single bout of high-impact exercise in postmenopausal females. IGF does not change, but the insulin-like growth factor–binding protein-3 increases biphasically (two peaks) during exercise and then 22 hours after exercise. This could be important for osteoporosis prevention.


Adipose Tissue


Testosterone may suppress leptin in an acute bout of exercise, but this is confounded by the duration and intensity of the exercise. In general, serum leptin concentrations are unchanged by short-duration (<~40 minutes) light- to-moderate submaximal exercise. However, both very short-duration high-intensity anaerobic exercise (including resistance exercise) and long-duration moderate-to- heavy submaximal aerobic exercise appear to reduce serum leptin concentrations. These findings may also be related to changes in nutrient availability or flux at the adipocytes. The clinical relevance of the effects of exercise on circulating leptin concentration has not yet been established (Hulver and Houmard, 2003
; Zafeiridis et al., 2003
). Low and moderate aerobic exercise do not cause a change in adiponectin, but levels (corrected for plasma volume changes) increase 30 minutes after heavy or maximal aerobic exercise (Ferguson et al., 2004
; Jürimäe et al., 2005
, 2006a
,b
; Kraemer and Castracane, 2007
).



Adipose tissue releases multiple inflammatory factors including IL-6. During prolonged exercise, there is a suppression of adipose derived IL-6, but following exercise, there is a rise in levels of IL-6. It is hypothesized that the rise in IL-6 may alter fat metabolism in recovery from exercise (

Nimmo et al., 2013

).





Hormonal Adaptations to Training




Training programs are not usually deliberately designed to bring about adaptations in the hormonal system. No research-based training principles have been established, and few systematic attempts have been made to vary intensity, duration, frequency, length of training period, and modality in large numbers of subjects. Some information has been derived from cross-sectional studies that compared untrained (or sedentary) individuals to trained (or fit) individuals. Some information has also been derived from testing individuals before and after a training period. More information and consensus exists about hormonal responses to a long-term absolute submaximal aerobic exercise training program that is moderate to heavy in intensity. This section describes those changes and what training adaptations are known to result from resistance training programs. It is important to understand that adaptations in one hormone may impact plasma levels of another, and changes in receptor sensitivity may not be reflected in circulating hormone levels. Furthermore, adaptations in sympathetic nervous system responses may cause changes in hormonal levels. As with hormonal responses to exercise, training adaptations in the metabolic, cardiorespiratory, and neuromuscular systems often result from adaptations in the endocrine system.


Adaptations Related to Metabolic Function


Most of what is known about hormonal training adaptations comes from studies comparing the response of individuals to a prolonged bout of exercise before and after exercise training (Figure 21.14
). The major hormones involved in fuel mobilization (glucagon, insulin, NE, E, cortisol) all show a dampening effect as a result of exercise training; that is, the change from resting levels that occurs during exercise represents a smaller disruption of homeostasis than in the untrained state (Bunt, 1986
). Given that endurance training decreases the sympathetic nervous system response to an absolute workload, epinephrine and norepinephrine are expected to have muted responses (Figure 21.14A
).

The decline in insulin is less in the trained than in the untrained state (

Figure 21.14B

). The rise in glucagon is also less: so much less that 60 minutes of submaximal exercise may not be long enough or intense enough to cause a glucagon response in a trained individual (

Figure 21.14C

) (

Coggan and Williams, 1995

;
 
Sutton et al., 1990

). Increased insulin sensitivity compensates for these changes. Growth hormone and cortisol have the same dampening effect, although both of these appear to have higher resting levels in aerobically trained than in untrained individuals (

Figure 21.14D

 and
 
E

). Resistance-trained individuals appear to have unchanged resting GH concentrations (

Kraemer, 1992a

;
 
Kraemer and Ratamess, 2005

).



Adaptations Related to Cardiovascular Function


Neither of the hormones primarily responsible for fluid and electrolyte balance (ADH and aldosterone) show any clear training adaptation. However, plasma volume is higher in trained versus untrained individuals. The thyroid hormones adapt with an enhanced turnover rate, but too little is known about parathyroid hormone to draw any conclusion
.



At the end of incremental exercise to maximum, E, NE, and cortisol are increased posttraining. Higher values reflect the trained individual’s ability to do more high-intensity work (

Borer, 2003

;
 
Bunt, 1986

;
 
Kjaer and Lange, 2000

;
 
Sutton et al., 1990

).



Adaptations Related to Muscle, Bone, and Adipose Tissue


Muscle


It has been hypothesized that IGF initially decreases as a result of training but that after an unknown length of time (probably longer than 5 weeks), resting levels of both GH and IGF increase, indicating an anabolic (tissue growth) internal environment (Eliakim et al., 2000
).



The impact of chronic training on testosterone is controversial, possibly depending on the level of training. Moderate training results in an increase and extreme training a decrease (

Urhausen and Kindermann, 2000

). Together, a training increase in testosterone and growth hormone could contribute to increases in muscle mass (

Kraemer, 1992b

).



Bone


Moderate exercise training appears to result in elevated resting levels of estrogen and progesterone, whereas severe training results in decreased resting levels. Male and female athletes reportedly have lower PTH levels and higher bone mineral density than nonathletes (Chilibeck, 2000
).


Adipose Tissue


Training suppresses leptin levels (Gleim and Glace, 2000
) if fat mass is lost. Exercise training often leads to a decrease in overall body fat. Levels of leptin are generally low in athletes of both sexes as well as in recreational runners, consistent with low levels of body fat. Also, in the general population, activity levels and leptin have been shown to be negatively related in both
 sexes (Popovic and Duntas, 2005
). Finally, some studies have reported decreased resting concentrations of leptin with endurance or resistance training (McMurray and Hackney, 2005
). Acute low-to-moderate physical activity causes hormonal changes that facilitate lipolytic activity, but trained individuals may be more sensitive to hormonal signals for the mobilization of fat as a fuel source (McMurray and Hackney, 2005
). Training increases resting adiponectin levels in previously sedentary individuals (Blüher et al., 2006
) but not necessarily in already highly trained athletes. For example, elite rowers despite a volume-extended training season did not exhibit any resting adiponectin level changes ( Jürimäe et al., 2006a
,b
).


Hormonal Adaptations to Resistance Training


A hallmark of resistance training is an increase in muscle mass/hypertrophy. Hormones are thought to play an important role in mediating this adaptation. Figure 21.15
 depicts a theoretical model by which hormones, and other factors, may respond to mechanical and/or metabolic stress and result in muscle hypertrophy. Multiple hormones are involved in various cellular responses that result in increased protein synthesis. This section will only address the primary hormonal adaptations that have been investigated following resistance training.









FIGURE 21.15
 Theoretical Model of the Role of Hormones in Mediating Muscle Hypertrophy.
 GH, growth hormone; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IL-6, interleukin-6; ROS, reactive oxygen species.




Growth Hormone and IGF


It is widely thought that resistance programs designed to increase muscle mass result in increases in GH and IGF (Crewther et al., 2006
). It is believed that exercise-induced elevations of GH and IGF are mediated by increased lactate and hydrogen ion concentrations in the blood whereby a reduction in pH influences the secretion of GH hormone (Schoenfeld, 2013
). As seen in Figure 21.16A
 and B
, a resistance training program results in a small but significant decrease in resting GH and IGF concentrations (Mitchell et al., 2013
). Figure 21.17A
 and B
 shows the overall response to a single bout of resistance training before and after a training program. The values represent the area under the curve for the response and are thus much larger than the resting values. The data indicate that a resistance training program results in a small but significant decrease in the amount of GH and IGF secreted during exercise. Some research also suggests that acute GH responses may differ depending on age (Simon et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015), but considerably more research is needed to understand the effect of age and gender on hormonal adaptation to resistance training.

, and Free Testosterone (C)
.











FIGURE 21.17
 Effect of Resistance Training on Exercise Response of Growth Hormone (A)
, Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (B)
, and Free Testosterone (C)
.




Testosterone


The effect of resistance training on testosterone appears to be dependent on factors such as age, gender, training status, and exercise modality (Kramer et al., 2005; Schoenfeld, 2013
). As seen in Figure 21.16C
, research indicates that resistance-training programs result in slightly lower resting concentrations of testosterone, although the significance of these small changes remains unclear (Mitchell et al., 2013
). It is thought that testosterone only influences muscle hypertrophy in hypo- or hyper-testosterone conditions, emphasizing the importance of other components within the signaling cascade. Figure 21.17C
 shows data that indicate that the free testosterone released during a single bout of resistance training is also significantly decreased following a resistance training program, but the magnitude of the decrease is small. The role of testosterone in metabolic adaptations requires further investigation to determine its effect within normal ranges (Mitchell et al. 2013
)
.


IL-6


IL-6 is released from muscle cells and is implicated in structural adaptations following a resistance training program. However, research studies report inconsistent findings regarding IL-6 and its contribution to muscle hypertrophy. Some studies have shown increased IL-6 concentration in the blood immediately postexercise but no direct role of IL-6 in hypertrophic adaptations (Mitchell et al., 2013
). Other research has found no difference in IL-6 as a result of training programs. It is possible that measuring IL-6 in the active muscle instead of blood concentrations would allow researchers to draw more meaningful conclusions regarding the influence of IL-6 on muscle size structure (Mitchell et al., 2013
).




SUMMARY





1.
 The nervous system and hormonal system both help maintain homeostasis and respond to the stress of exercise. These systems interact and overlap in multiple ways, so much so that they are often referred to collectively as the neurohormonal system. Both systems communicate with target cells by chemical messengers.




2.
 A target cell is activated when the chemical message from the nervous system (neurotransmitter) or endocrine system (hormone) binds to receptors on or in the target cell. Receptor activation can cause one or more of the following: change in the electrical state of the cell, change in enzyme activity, change in secretory activity of the cell, muscle contraction, or protein synthesis.




3.
 The autonomic nervous system (ANS) carries information from the CNS to cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and endocrine glands. The two branches of the ANS, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, work in opposition to each other. The sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in directing the body’s response to exercise, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system is particularly important during recovery from exercise.




4.
 The exercise response is mediated primarily through the sympathetic nervous system. Its primary functions during exercise are to enhance cardiorespiratory function, regulate blood flow and maintain blood pressure, maintain thermal balance, and increase fuel mobilization for the production of energy.




5.
 During exercise, several metabolic hormones (glucagon, insulin, growth hormone, epinephrine [E], and norepinephrine [NE]) function together to mobilize fuel for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and to maintain blood glucose levels.




6.
 During exercise, several hormones help enhance cardiac function (E, NE), distribute blood to active tissue (E, NE), and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance (antidiuretic hormone [ADH], renin, and aldosterone).




7.
 Hormonal adaptations may result from aerobic exercise training, or individuals may become more sensitive to a lower level of hormone so that the same effect occurs following training even without a changed baseline hormonal level. The most common pattern is a blunted hormonal response to exercise following training (glucagon being an important exception).




8.
 Resistance training is consistently associated with small but significant reductions in resting and exercise levels of GH, IGF, and testosterone.
