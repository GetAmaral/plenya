Introduction




All types of human movement, no matter what the mode, duration, or intensity, require an expenditure of energy above resting values. Much of this energy comes from the use of oxygen. To supply the working muscles with the needed oxygen, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together. The responses of the respiratory system during exercise are detailed in Chapter 10
. This chapter describes the parallel cardiovascular responses to dynamic aerobic activity, static exercise, and dynamic resistance exercise. Minimal attention is paid here to short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise because this type of activity is typically performed to stress the metabolic system and is therefore discussed in detail in the metabolic unit.




Cardiovascular Responses to Aerobic Exercise




Aerobic exercise requires more energy—and therefore more oxygen (remember the term aerobic means “with oxygen”)—than either static or dynamic resistance exercise. How much oxygen is needed depends primarily on the intensity of the activity and secondarily on its duration. As in the discussion of respiration, this chapter categorizes exercises as:



1.
 Short-term (5–10 minutes), light (30–49% maximal oxygen consumption,
 

) to moderate (50–74%
 

) submaximal exercise




2.
 Long-term (>30 minutes), moderate to heavy (60–85%
 

) submaximal exercise




3.
 Incremental exercise to maximum (increasing from ~30 to 100%
 

).



Short-Term, Light to Moderate Submaximal Aerobic Exercise



Figure 12.1
 depicts generalized cardiovascular responses to short-term, light to moderate submaximal aerobic exercise. The actual magnitude of each variable’s change depends on the work rate or load, environmental conditions, and the individual’s genetic makeup and fitness level. At the onset of light- to moderate-intensity exercise, cardiac output (

) initially increases to plateau at a steady state (see Figure 12.1A
). Cardiac output plateaus within the first 2 minutes of exercise, reflecting the fact that cardiac output is sufficient to transport the oxygen needed to support the metabolic demands of the activity. Cardiac output increases because of an initial increase in both stroke volume (SV) (Figure 12.1B
) and heart rate (HR) (Figure 12.1C
); both level off within 2 minutes.

During exercise of this intensity, the cardiorespiratory system can meet the body’s metabolic demands; thus, this type of exercise is often called
 steady-state
 or steady-rate exercise. During steady-state exercise, energy provided aerobically is balanced with the energy required to perform the exercise. The plateau in cardiovascular variables (in
 
Figure 12.1

) indicates that a steady state has been achieved.






Steady-State
 A condition in which the energy provided during exercise is balanced with the energy required to perform that exercise, and factors responsible for the provision of this energy reach elevated levels of equilibrium.





Stroke volume (SV) increases rapidly at the onset of exercise due to an increase in venous return, which in turn increases the end-diastolic volume (EDV) (preload). The increased preload stretches the myocardium and causes it to contract more forcibly, as described by the Frank-Starling law of the heart (

Chapter 11

). Contractility of the myocardium is also enhanced by the sympathetic nervous system, which is activated during physical activity. The increase in the EDV and the decrease in the end-systolic volume (ESV) both contribute to the increase in the SV during light to moderate dynamic exercise (

Poliner et al., 1980

). HR increases immediately at the onset of activity as a result of parasympathetic withdrawal. As exercise continues, further increases in the HR result from the sympathetic nervous system activation (

Rowell, 1986

).




Systolic blood pressure (SBP) rises in a pattern very similar to that of cardiac output: an initial increase followed by a plateau once steady state is achieved (

Figure 12.1D

). The increase in SBP results from the increased cardiac output. SBP would be even higher if not for the fact that resistance decreases, thereby partially offsetting the increase in cardiac output. When blood pressure (BP) is measured intra-arterially, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) does not change. When it is measured by auscultation, it either does not change or may go down slightly. DBP remains relatively constant because of peripheral vasodilation, which facilitates blood flow to the working muscles. The small rise in SBP and the lack of a significant change in DBP cause the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to rise only slightly, following the pattern of SBP.




Total peripheral resistance (TPR) decreases because of vasodilation in the active muscles (

Figure 12.1E

). This vasodilation results primarily from the influence of local chemical factors (lactate, K
+
, and so on), which reflect increased metabolism. The TPR can be calculated using Equation 11.8:











Example






Calculate TPR for an individual doing short-term, light to moderate submaximal aerobic exercise by using the following information from Figure 12.1A
 and D
:











The computation is












Thus, in this example, TPR is 7.33

.







The decrease in TPR has two important implications. First, vasodilation of the vessels supplying the active muscle causes decreased resistance that leads to an increased blood flow, thereby increasing the availability of oxygen and nutrients. Second, the decreased resistance keeps MAP from increasing dramatically. The increase in the MAP is determined by the relative changes in cardiac output and the TPR. Since cardiac output increases more than resistance decreases, the MAP increases slightly during dynamic aerobic exercise.



Myocardial oxygen consumption increases during dynamic aerobic exercise because the heart must do more work to increase cardiac output to supply the working muscles with additional oxygen. The rate-pressure product (RPP) increases due to increases in the HR and the SBP. This increase reflects the greater myocardial oxygen demand of the heart during exercise (

Figure 12.1F

). In the

Blood volume decreases during submaximal aerobic exercise.
 
Figure 12.2

 shows the reduction of plasma volume during 30 minutes of moderate cycle ergometer exercise (60–70%
 

) in a warm environment (

Fortney et al., 1981

). The largest decrease occurs during the first 5 minutes of exercise, and then plasma volume stabilizes. This rapid decrease in plasma volume suggests that it is fluid shifts, rather than fluid loss, that account for the initial decrease (

Wade and Freund, 1990

). The magnitude of the decrease in plasma volume depends on the intensity of exercise, environmental factors, and the individual’s hydration status.

Cardiac output reflects the total amount of blood pumped per minute by the heart. Cardiac output increases

 during exercise, but there are also adjustments in how the blood flow is distributed to different organs.
 
Figure 12.3

 shows the distribution of cardiac output at rest and during light aerobic exercise. Notice that cardiac output increases from 5.8 to 9.4 L·min
−1
 in this example (the increase in
 

 is illustrated by the larger pie chart). The most dramatic change in cardiac output distribution with light exercise is the increased percentage (from 21 to 47%) and the increased blood flow (from 1,200 to 4,500 mL) to the working muscles to support energy production. Skin blood flow also increases to meet the thermoregulatory demands of exercise. The absolute blood flow to the coronary muscle also increases, although its percentage of cardiac output remains relatively constant. The absolute amount of cerebral blood flow remains constant while the percentage of cardiac output distributed to the brain decreases. Both renal and splanchnic blood flow are modestly decreased during light exercise. In summary, with aerobic exercise, cardiac output increases, and it is redistributed so that tissues that need increased blood flow, such as the muscles and skin, receive it, and other tissues receive either equal or less blood flow.

Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Aerobic Exercise


The cardiovascular responses to long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise (60–85% of 

) are shown in Figure 12.4
. Similar to light to moderate workloads, cardiac output increases rapidly during the first minutes of exercise and then plateaus and remains relatively constant throughout the exercise (Figure 12.4A
). Notice, however, that the absolute cardiac output attained is higher during heavy exercise than during light to moderate exercise. The increase in cardiac output results from increased SV and HR.

SV has an initial increase, plateaus, and then has a negative (downward) drift as exercise duration continues past approximately 30 minutes. SV increases rapidly during the first minutes of exercise and then plateaus after a workload of approximately 40–50% of
 

 is achieved (

Åstrand et al., 1964

) (

Figure 12.4B

). Thus, during work that requires more than 50%
 

, the SV response does not depend on intensity. SV remains relatively constant during the first 30 minutes of heavy exercise.




As with short-term, light to moderate submaximal aerobic exercise, the increase in SV is believed to result from an increased venous return (leading to the Frank-Starling mechanism) and increased contractility due to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Thus, changes in SV occur because EDV increases and ESV decreases (

Poliner et al., 1980

). EDV increases primarily because of the increased venous return of blood to the heart by the active muscle pump and increased venoconstriction, which decreases venous pooling. ESV decreases because of augmented contractility of the heart, which effectively ejects more blood.

The Importance of Fluid Ingestion






The magnitude of cardiovascular drift is heavily influenced by fluid ingestion. The accompanying figure presents data from a study in which participants cycled for 2 hours with or without fluid replacement. Values are for minutes 20 through 120; the initial increase in these variables is not shown. When participants consumed enough water to completely replace the water lost through sweat, cardiac output remained nearly constant throughout the first hour of exercise and actually increased during the 2nd hour (panel A). Cardiac output was maintained in the fluid replacement trial because SV did not drift downward (panel B). HR was significantly lower when fluid replacement occurred (panel C). This information is important for coaches and fitness leaders. If your clients exercise for prolonged periods, they must replace the fluids that are lost during exercise, or performance will suffer.

 Hamilton et al. (1991)
.





If the exercise continues beyond approximately 30 minutes, SV gradually drifts downward while remaining above the resting value. This downward shift is most often attributed to thermoregulatory stress, which results in vasodilation, plasma loss, and a redirection

 of blood

 to the cutaneous vessels to dissipate heat, effectively reducing venous return and thus SV. This theory suggests that HR increases to compensate for a decrease in SV in order to maintain
 

. An alternate viewpoint suggests that the downward drift in SV is due to an increase in HR (due to augmented sympathetic nerve activity) that leads to a reduced filling time, thus leading to a reduced SV (

Rowland, 2005b

).




HR initially increases, plateaus at steady state, and then has a positive drift as exercise continues for a prolonged period. HR increases sharply during the first 1–2 minutes of exercise, the magnitude of which depends on the intensity of exercise (

Figure 12.4C

). The increase in HR is brought about by parasympathetic withdrawal and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. After approximately 30 minutes of heavy exercise, HR begins to drift upward. The increase in HR is proportional to the decrease in SV, so cardiac output is maintained during exercise.




These cardiovascular changes, notably in HR and SV, during long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise without a change in workload, are known as
 cardiovascular drift
. Cardiovascular drift is probably associated with rising body temperature during prolonged exercise. Exercise and heat stress produce competing regulatory demands, as the skin and the muscles compete for increased blood flow. SV decreases as a result of vasodilation, a progressive increase in the fraction of blood being directed to the skin, a decrease in filling time, and a loss of plasma volume (

Rowell, 1974

;
 
Sjogaard et al., 1988

).






Cardiovascular Drift
 The changes in observed cardiovascular variables that occur during prolonged, heavy submaximal exercise without a change in workload.





SBP response to long-term, moderate to heavy submaximal aerobic exercise is characterized by an initial increase, a plateau at steady state, and a negative drift. SBP increases rapidly during the first 1–2 minutes of exercise, the magnitude of increase depending on the intensity of the exercise (

Figure 12.4D

). SBP then remains relatively stable or drifts slightly downward as a result of continued vasodilation and a resultant decrease in resistance (

Ekelund and Holmgren, 1967

). DBP does not change, or changes so little that it has no physiological significance, during prolonged exercise in a thermoneutral environment. But it may decrease slightly in a warm environment because of increased vasodilation resulting from heat production. Because of the increased SBP and the relatively stable DBP, MAP increases modestly during prolonged activity. Again, as in light to moderate exercise, MAP increases modestly due to a large increase in
 

 that is offset by a significant decrease in resistance

.




TPR decreases rapidly, plateaus, and then has a slight negative drift during long-term heavy exercise (

Figure 12.4E

) because of vasodilation in active muscle and because of vasodilation in cutaneous vessels (

Rowell, 1974

). Finally, because both HR and SBP increase substantially during heavy work, the rate-pressure product increases markedly with the onset of exercise and then plateaus at steady state (

Figure 12.4F

). An upward drift in rate-pressure product may occur after approximately 30 minutes of exercise because the HR increases more than SBP decreases. The high rate-pressure product reflects the large amount of work the heart must perform to support heavy exercise.




During prolonged exercise, particularly in a warm environment, total body fluid is continually lost due to sweating. This loss typically ranges from 900 to 1,300 mL·hr
−1
, depending on work intensity and environmental conditions (

Wade and Freund, 1990

). If fluid is not replaced during long-duration exercise, plasma volume will continually be reduced throughout the exercise.





Figure 12.5

 shows the distribution of cardiac output at rest and during heavy aerobic exercise. Notice that cardiac output increases from 5.8 L·min
−1
 at rest to 17.5 L·min
−1
 in this example, almost a threefold increase. The most dramatic change here is the increased blood flow to the working muscle, which now receives 71% of cardiac output. Skin blood flow is also increased to meet the thermoregulatory demands. The absolute blood flow to the coronary muscle increases while its percentage of cardiac output remains relatively constant. The absolute cerebral blood flow remains constant, while its percentage of cardiac output decreases. Both renal and splanchnic blood flow are further decreased as exercise intensity increases. Although blood flow to the working muscle increases during aerobic exercise, blood flow to the inactive muscle decreases because of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction in inactive muscle is necessary to ensure that cardiac output can supply adequate blood flow to the working muscle. In summary, cardiac output increases, and it is redistributed during heavy aerobic exercise so that tissues that need increased blood flow receive it and other tissues receive either equal or less blood flow.

FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Interval Exercise versus Steady-State Exercise






Throughout this book, we examine the exercise response to various categories of exercise, such as the cardiovascular responses
 in this chapter. Most studies examining cardiovascular responses to exercise have used continuous activity. Yet, many clinical populations (e.g., people undergoing cardiac rehabilitation) and many athletic populations use interval training. Interval workouts generally use repetitions from several seconds to several minutes in length and intensities from light to very hard.







Foster et al. set out to determine the cardiovascular responses to continuous exercise compared to those of very short-term, high-intensity interval exercise when the total power output remained constant. A group of adults (mean age = 52.9 years) participated in two separate 15-minute cycling trials—one involving steady-state exercise, the other using interval exercise. Participants cycled at 170 W for the full 15 minutes in one trial and alternated 1-minute “hard” (220 W) and “easy” (120 W) periods in the second trial, resulting in an equal power output (170 W) for both trials. Cardiovascular measurements were obtained before exercise (0 minute) and after minutes 4, 7, 12, and 15 and are presented in the accompanying graphs.








The results showed no significant difference in any of the variables between the steady-state exercise and the interval exercise. The authors concluded that heart function during interval exercise is remarkably similar to continuous steady-state exercise at the same average power output, when moderate duration and evenly timed hard and easy periods are used. These results are good news for individuals with low levels of fitness who may not be able to perform 15 minutes of continuous activity when starting an exercise program. Even if such individuals are unable to perform the high-intensity interval exercise used in this experiment, fitness professionals can assure them that alternating periods of “hard” and “easy” work results in cardiovascular responses similar to those resulting from sustained exercise of the same average power output.

Figure 12.6

 presents data from a study in which participants exercised on a cycle ergometer for 8 minutes, then added an arm-cranking exercise (

Secher et al., 1977

).

 The combination of leg and arm cycling increased cardiac output modestly but actually caused a decrease in leg blood flow because a portion of cardiac output now had to be distributed to the working muscles in the arm.

Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum



Figure 12.7
 presents cardiovascular responses to incremental aerobic exercise to maximum. Note that unlike the graphs for light to moderate and heavy exercise (presented in Figures 12.1
 and 12.4
), the cardiovascular variables are now presented with percentage of maximum work on the x-axis. Incremental exercise to maximum (or a max test) consists of a series of work stages, each becoming progressively harder, that continue until volitional fatigue. The duration of each work stage (level of intensity) varies from 1 to 3 minutes to allow a steady state to occur, at least at the lower workloads. Max tests are performed in laboratory settings to quantify physiological responses to the maximal work that an individual can perform. Incremental tests to maximum may or may not include the direct measurement of oxygen consumption.
 The techniques used in the direct measurement of oxygen consumption are presented in Chapter 4
.

During an incremental test, cardiac output has a rectilinear increase and plateaus at maximal exercise (

Figure 12.7A

). The initial increase in cardiac output reflects an increase in the SV and the HR; however, at workloads greater than 40–50%
 

, the continued increase in cardiac output in untrained individuals is achieved almost completely by an increase in the HR. As shown in
 
Figure 12.7B

, in untrained individuals, the SV increases rectilinearly initially and then plateaus at approximately 40–50% of
 

 (

Åstrand et al., 1964

;
 
Higginbotham et al., 1986

). The exact SV response to incremental exercise continues to be debated (

González-Alonso, 2008

;
 
Munch et al., 2014

;
 
Rowland, 2005a

,
 
2005b

;
 
Warburton and Gledhill, 2008

). As indicated above, it has traditionally been believed that the SV plateaus at approximately 50%
 

 in untrained individuals. However, there appears to be considerable interindividual variability in this response, and many laboratories have reported an increase in the SV at maximal exercise in most endurance athletes and some untrained individuals (

Ferguson et al., 2001

;
 
Gledhill et al., 1994

;
 
Warburton et al., 1999

). In contrast, other researchers have documented a decrease in the SV at the maximal exercise (

Mortensen et al., 2005

;
 
Stringer et al., 1997

), and some researchers contend that after an initial increase (due to the skeletal muscle pump returning the pooled venous blood to the heart), the SV remains essentially unchanged during the incremental maximal exercise (

Rowland, 2005b

). Much of the controversy is undoubtedly associated with difficulties in measuring the SV during maximal exercise (see
 
Chapter 11

), with the use of different exercise protocols, and with individual variability.




Theoretically, stroke volume could increase due to an increase in EDV, a decrease in ESV, or a combination of both.
 
Figure 12.8

 provides data on changes in the EDV and the ESV during progressively increasing exercise (

Poliner et al., 1980

). The EDV increases largely because of the return of blood to the heart by the active muscle pump and the increased sympathetic outflow to the veins causing venoconstriction and augmenting venous return. ESV decreases because of augmented contractility of the heart, which ejects more blood and leaves less in the ventricle. More recent work using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) suggests that the decrease in ESV accounts for most of the increase in SV during maximal exercise (

La Gerche et al., 2013

).

 Changes in EDV and ESV That Accountfor Change in SV during Incremental Exercise.

 Based on data from Poliner et al. (1980).





HR increases in a rectilinear fashion throughout much of the submaximal (~120–170 b·min
−1
) portion of incremental exercise and plateaus at maximal exercise (

Figure 12.7C

) (

Åstrand and Rhyming, 1954

;
 
Hale, 2008

). Myocardial cells can contract at over 300 b·min
−1
 but rarely exceed 210 b·min
−1
 because a faster HR would not allow for adequate ventricular filling. Thus, SV and ultimately cardiac output would decrease. Consider the simple analogy of a bucket brigade. Up to a point, it is useful to increase the speed of passing buckets under the water source, but the maximum rate is limited because of the time required for the buckets to be filled with water.




The arterial BP responses to incremental dynamic exercise to maximum are shown in
 
Figure 12.7D

. SBP increases rectilinearly and plateaus at maximal exercise, often reaching values in excess of 200 mmHg in very fit individuals. This increase is caused by the increased cardiac output, which outweighs the simultaneous decrease in resistance. SBP and HR are routinely monitored during exercise tests to ensure the safety of the participant. If either of these variables fails to rise with an increasing workload, cardiovascular insufficiency and an inability to adequately perfuse tissue may result, and the exercise test should be stopped. A drop in SBP of 10 mmHg or more that occurs despite an increase in workload represents an absolute indication that the exercise test or session should be discontinued. Similarly, a rise in SBP above 250 mmHg or in DBP above 115 mmHg are relative indications (meaning they may be superseded by clinical judgment) that indicate that the exercise test or session should be discontinued because these are not normal blood pressure responses (American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM], 2014).




DBP typically remains relatively constant or changes so little it has no physiological significance, although it may decrease at high levels of exercise. Diastolic pressure remains relatively constant because vasodilation in the vasculature of the active muscle is balanced by vasoconstriction in other vascular beds. Diastolic pressure is most likely to decrease when exercise is performed in a hot environment because skin vessels are more dilated and there is decreased resistance to blood flow. A rise in DBP above 115 mmHg is an indicator that the exercise test or session should be discontinued.




Individuals with an exaggerated BP response to exercise are at greater risk for hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease mortality than those with a

 normal exercise BP response (ACSM, 1993;

Exaggerated Blood Pressure Responses and Carotid Atherosclerosis






It has been known for some time that an exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise, in otherwise apparently healthy individuals, is predictive of future hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease mortality. In this study, researchers investigated the hypothesis that an exaggerated SBP response to incremental aerobic exercise to maximum was associated with carotid atherosclerosis (deposition of fatty plaque in the carotid artery) in middle-aged (~48 years) men.







The researchers used data from over 9,000 apparently healthy men who had undergone an exercise stress test and a series of cardiovascular tests. No participants had a history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Approximately 4% or 375 participants had an exaggerated SBP response to exercise (defined as SBP >210 mmHg). When the researchers compared the group that had an exaggerated SBP response to exercise to those who had a normal response, they found that individuals with an exaggerated SBP response to exercise had a 2.02 times increased risk for carotid atherosclerosis.








These results suggest that an exaggerated SBP response to exercise is independently related to an increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis.

TPR decreases in a negative curvilinear pattern and reaches its lowest level at maximal exercise (

Figure 12.7E

). Decreased resistance reflects maximal vasodilation in the active tissue in response to the need for increased blood flow during maximal exercise. The large drop in resistance is also important for keeping MAP from becoming too high. The rate-pressure product increases in a rectilinear fashion plateauing at maximum in an incremental exercise test (

Figure 12.7F

), paralleling the increases in HR and SBP.

The reduction in plasma volume during submaximal exercise also occurs in incremental exercise to maximum. Because the magnitude of the reduction depends on the intensity of exercise, the reduction is greatest at maximal exercise. A decrease of 10–20% can be seen during incremental exercise to maximum (Wade and Freund, 1990
).



Considerable changes in cardiac output occur during maximal incremental exercise.
 
Figure 12.9

 illustrates the distribution of cardiac output at rest and at maximal aerobic exercise. Maximum cardiac output in this example is 25 L·min
−1
. Again, the most striking change is the tremendous amount of cardiac output that is directed to the working muscles (88%). At maximal exercise, skin blood flow is reduced to direct the necessary blood to the muscles. Renal and splanchnic blood flows also decrease considerably. Blood flow to the brain and cardiac muscle is maintained.

Maximal Oxygen Consumption


Oxygen consumption rises rectilinearly in direct proportion to the exercise intensity during an incremental exercise to maximum (Figure 12.7G
). The highest amount of oxygen an individual can take in, transport, and utilize to produce ATP aerobically while breathing air during heavy exercise is called maximal oxygen consumption
 (

)
. As described above, the maximal oxygen intake is measured during an incremental maximal exercise test. As described in Chapter 11
, 

 can be defined by rearranging the Fick equation (see Equation 11.9) to the following equation:









Maximal Oxygen Consumption (
)
 The highest amount of oxygen an individual can take in transport and utilize to produce ATP aerobically while breathing air during heavy exercise.





The rectilinear increase in cardiac output during a maximal incremental exercise test is described above. The changes in the a-vO

diff (discussed in
 
Chapter 10

) are an increase with a plateau at approximately 60%
 

. The result of these changes is the rectilinear rise in oxygen up to maximum, which has been discussed.

 are routinely administered by coaches and trainers to determine an athlete’s fitness or to track changes in fitness, by researchers to better understand the mechanisms that limit exercise or to probe questions related to physiological function under stressful conditions, and by medical personnel to assess cardiorespiratory function.






 is commonly used as the criterion measure of cardiorespiratory (also called aerobic) fitness. In reality,
 

 is an integrated measure of fitness that encompasses the ability of the body to take in (respiratory system), transport (cardiovascular system), and utilize (the metabolic system) oxygen. Thus,

 primarily as a cardiovascular variable and it is discussed in depth in this chapter.



CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING When the individual reaches volitional fatigue the highest oxygen
 consumption may or may not represent an actual maximal value. Before labeling the highest value as 

, the exercise tester has to decide whether any given test truly is a maximal one. The term 

 is used to represent the highest value obtained during the test if the tester is not certain that a true maximal value was achieved. Criteria used to determine whether the test is a maximal test include:



1.
 A lactate value greater than 8–9 mmol·L
−1
 (

Åstrand, 1956

;
 
Åstrand et al., 2003

)




2.
 A heart rate ± 12 b·min
−1
 of predicted maximal heart rate (220 minus age) (

Durstine and Pate, 1988

)




3.
 A respiratory exchange ratio (RER, see
 
Chapter 4

) of 1.0 or 1.1, primarily depending on the age of the subject (

Holly, 1988

;
 
MacDougall et al., 1982

)




4.
 A plateau in oxygen consumption. The classic definition of a plateau is a rise of 2.1 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 or less, or a rise of 0.15 L·min
−1
 or less, in oxygen consumption ( 


) with an increase in workload that represents a change in grade of 2.5% while running at 7 mi·hr
−1
 (11.2 km·hr
−1
) with 3-minute stages (

Taylor et al., 1955

). An alternative is to define a plateau as an increase of less than half the expected theoretical rise based on the change in speed, grade, or speed and grade (

Plowman and Liu, 1999

). The expected increase can be calculated using the
 
ACSM (2014)

 equations provided in Appendix B.



FACTORS LIMITING At some point, an individual cannot continue to increase the intensity of the exercise load or to work at maximum effort because the body cannot provide and utilize more oxygen to support an additional workload. But what specifically limits 

? Figure 12.10
 summarizes possible limitations to oxygen consumption within the major systems involved in oxygen delivery and use during exercise.

Theoretically, maximal oxygen uptake could be limited by any system (or step) along the pathway of bringing oxygen into the body and delivering it to the

 mitochondria for the production of ATP. Thus, any of the following systems may limit
 

:




1.
 The respiratory system, because of inadequate ventilation, oxygen diffusion limitations, or an inability to maintain the gradient for the diffusion of O
2
 (a-vO
2
diff)




2.
 The cardiovascular system, because of inadequate blood flow (


) or oxygen-carrying capacity (Hb)




3.
 The metabolic functions within skeletal muscle, such as an inability to produce additional ATP because of limited number of mitochondria, limited enzyme levels or activity, or limited substrates




Evidence suggests that each of these systems may limit
 

 in certain conditions (

Bergh et al., 2000

). For example, a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO
2
) at altitude or with asthma causes a reduction in
 

. Medications (such as beta-blockers) that limit cardiac output also cause a decrease in
 

, as does a reduction in hemoglobin associated with anemia. Certain diseases in which muscle enzymes involved in metabolism are deficient can also result in reduced
 

.




Although factors in each of these systems may limit
 

, the question remains: What limits
 

 in healthy humans performing maximal exercise? This question has energized exercise physiologists for decades, beginning with the work of A. V. Hill in the 1920s, and it continues to engender lively debate among physiologists today (

Bassett and Howley, 2000

;
 
Bergh et al., 2000

;
 
Elliott et al., 2015

;
 
Ferretti, 2014

;
 
Grassi, 2000

;
 
Hale, 2008

;
 
Rowland, 2013

;
 
Saltin, 1985

).




Current research suggests that maximal oxygen uptake is limited by the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the muscle, rather than the ability of the muscle mitochondria to utilize oxygen (

Bergh et al., 2000

;
 
Elliott et al., 2015

;
 
Hale, 2008

;
 
Rowell, 1993

;
 
Saltin, 1985

). Specifically, cardiac output appears to be the limiting factor in
 

 (

Bergh et al., 2000

;
 
di Prampero, 2003

;
 
Saltin, 1985

).




Research evidence suggests that oxygen uptake is not limited by pulmonary ventilation in normal, healthy athletes without exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (

Chapter 10

). Generally, the functional capacity of the respiratory system is believed to exceed the demands of maximal exercise (

Rowell, 1993

). The only respiratory or cardiovascular variable likely to impose a limitation on oxygen transport is a-vO
2
diff

.




Many researchers report that skeletal muscles have the ability to use more oxygen than can be supplied by the respiratory and cardiovascular systems (

Richardson, 2000

;
 
Rowell, 1993

;
 
Saltin, 1985

). Not all researchers agree with this view, though, and some have proposed that failure of muscle performance may explain exhaustion during maximal exercise (

Noakes, 1988

).




Possibly, the factors limiting
 

 vary with the fitness level of the individual. According to this hypothesis, in an untrained individual, the respiratory capacity for gas exchange exceeds the cardiovascular system’s capacity to deliver oxygen. A training program results in little change in the respiratory capacity but large changes in the cardiovascular capacity. Thus, in some highly trained individuals who have exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (

Chapter 10

), the increased cardiovascular capacity may exceed the respiratory capacity (

Dempsey, 1986

;
 
Legrand et al., 2005

;
 
Powers et al., 1989

). In this case, the respiratory system becomes the factor limiting
 

. One final point to remember, although it is interesting to probe the question, “what limits
 

?” we must resist the temptation to allow the search for an answer to obscure the fact that a close interaction exists among the various systems ensuring a continuous supply of oxygen to the working tissue during exercise (

Mitchell and Saltin, 2003

).



Upper-Body versus Lower-Body Aerobic Exercise


Upper-body exercise is routinely performed in a variety of industrial, agricultural, military, recreational, and sporting activities. The cardiovascular responses to exercise using muscles of the upper body are different in some important ways from exercise performed using muscles of the lower body. Figure 12.11
 presents data about cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise to maximum in able-bodied individuals using the upper body (arm cranking on an arm ergometer) versus lower body (cycling on a cycle ergometer). Notice that a higher peak 

 was achieved during lower-body exercise. Comparisons at any given level of oxygen consumption also show differences in cardiovascular responses to submaximal upper- and lower-body exercise. When the oxygen consumption required to perform a submaximal workload is the same, cardiac
 output is similar for upper- and lower-body exercise (Figure 12.11A
). However, the mechanism to achieve the required increase in cardiac output is not the same. As shown in Figure 12.11B
 and C
, upper-body exercise results in a lower SV and a higher HR at any given submaximal workload (Clausen, 1976
; Miles et al., 1989
; Pendergast, 1989
). SBP, DBP, MAP (Figure 12.11D
), total peripheral resistance (Figure 12.11E
), and rate-pressure product (Figure 12.11F
) are significantly higher in upper-body exercise than in lower-body exercise performed at the same oxygen consumption.

There are several likely reasons for the differences. The higher HR observed during upper-body exercise is thought to reflect a greater sympathetic stimulation (

Åstrand et al., 2003

;
 
Davies et al., 1974

;
 
Miles et al., 1989

). SV is lower during upper-body exercise because of the absence of the skeletal muscle pump augmenting venous return from the legs. The greater sympathetic stimulation that occurs during upper-body exercise may also be partially responsible for the increased BP and total peripheral resistance. Upper-body exercise often involves a static component that causes an exaggerated BP response. For instance, using an arm-cranking ergometer has a static component because the individual must grasp the hand crank.

 Clinically Relevant





Cardiovascular Demands of Shoveling Wet, Heavy Snow






As the text has described, upper-body exercise is associated with greater cardiovascular strain (exemplified by higher HRs and higher BPs at any given submaximal level of oxygen consumption) than lower-body exercise. Similarly, both static and dynamic resistance exercise are characterized by modest increases in HR but exaggerated increases in BP. Snow shoveling involves a unique combination of a predominantly upper-body activity with both static and dynamic components. In addition, snow shoveling is always done in cold and sometimes frigid conditions and often when the individual is under the added stress of digging out to get somewhere on time. It is not unusual to hear about individuals collapsing and dying of heart attacks while clearing snow.







In a classic study, Franklin et al. performed an experiment to determine the specific demands of snow shoveling on the heart. Ten sedentary, healthy, young adult males cleared two 15-m paths of wet, heavy snow 5–13 cm deep outside in the cold (2°C) for 10 minutes. In one trial, they used a 1.4-kg plastic shovel. They were told to repeatedly lift and throw the snow to the side at a self-selected rate. The group mean was 12 ± 2 loads per minute at approximately 7.3 kg per load for a total of 872.7 kg (1,920 lb) over the 10-minute time span. In the second trial, they used a motorized snow blower. Ten to fifteen minutes of rest was permitted between the randomly assigned trials. On another day, each participant underwent a treadmill maximal oxygen consumption test in the laboratory. The results are presented in the accompanying table.








After only 2 minutes of snow shoveling, the participants’ average HR was 85% of the treadmill HRmax. The HR continued to increase until it reached 98% HRmax. The SBP during the snow shoveling exceeded the treadmill maximum by 9.3%. The total body oxygen consumption was only 61.3%
 

, but the myocardial oxygen consumption, as indicated by the rate-pressure product, was 107% of that required during maximal treadmill work. The disproportionate increase in myocardial oxygen demand relative to total body oxygen demand during shoveling was attributed to several factors: a reduced myocardial efficiency of arm exercise, a large static exercise component, the Valsalva maneuver, and the inhalation of cold air that could cause a spasm or constriction in the coronary arteries. These results clearly indicate that shoveling wet, heavy snow even for a short time period (10 minutes) places a tremendous physiological demand on the heart.








In contrast, using the snow blower resulted in elevations to only 69% HRmax, 89% maximal SBP, 25%
 

, and 61% maximal myocardial oxygen consumption, as reflected by the rate-pressure product. Whereas the manual shoveling was perceived as “very heavy” work, using the snow blower resulted in a “fairly light” rating.








The healthy but untrained participants in this study completed the shoveling without any adverse cardiac or musculoskeletal complications. Such work, especially if continued for 20–60 minutes, would provide a heavy but acceptable workout. However, these results suggest that individuals with a history of heart disease, symptoms suggestive of cardiac disorder (dizziness, chest pain, and abnormal electrocardiograms), or one or more major coronary risk factors (see
 
Chapter 15

) should avoid this work or take precautions when faced with the task of clearing wet, heavy snow. These precautions include:









Take frequent breaks or use a work-rest approach.






Use both arms and legs in the lift-throw action.






Regulate body temperature with a hat, scarf over the mouth, and layers that can easily be added or removed.






Avoid large meals, alcohol consumption, and smoking immediately before and after shoveling.






Consider using a motorized snow blower.

When maximal exercise is performed using upper-body muscles,
 

 values are approximately 30% lower than when maximal exercise is performed using lower-body muscles (

Miles et al., 1989

;
 
Pendergast, 1989

). Maximal HR values for upper-body exercise are 90–95% of those for lower-body exercise, and SV is 30–40% less during maximal upper-body exercise. Maximal SBP and the rate-pressure product are usually similar, but DBP is typically 10–15% higher during upper-body exercise (

Miles et al., 1989

).




The different cardiovascular responses to an absolute workload performed with the upper body versus the lower body dictate that exercise prescriptions for arm work cannot be based on data obtained from testing with leg exercises. Furthermore, the greater cardiovascular strain associated with upper-body work must be kept in mind when one prescribes exercise for individuals with cardiovascular disease.

Cardiovascular Responses to Static Exercise




Static work occurs repeatedly during daily activities, such as lifting and carrying heavy objects. It is also a common form of activity encountered in many occupational settings, particularly manufacturing jobs where lifting is common. Additionally, many sports and recreational activities have a static component associated with their performance. For example, weight lifting, rowing, and racquet sports all involve static exercise. The magnitude of the cardiovascular response to static exercise is affected by several factors, but most importantly by the intensity of muscle contraction.


Intensity of Muscle Contraction


The cardiovascular response to static exercise depends on the intensity of contraction, provided the contraction is held for a specified time period. The intensity of a static contraction is expressed as a percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC). Figure 12.12
 illustrates the cardiovascular response to static contractions of the forearm (handgrip) muscles at 10, 20, and 50% MVC. Notice that at 10 and 20% MVC, the contraction could be held for 5 minutes, but at 50% MVC, the contraction could be held for only 2 minutes. Thus, as in aerobic exercise, intensity and duration are inversely related. Also note that the data presented in this figure are from handgrip exercises. Although the pattern of response appears to be similar for different muscle groups, the actual values may vary considerably depending on the amount of active muscle involved.

Cardiac output increases during static contractions due to an increase in HR, with the magnitude of the increase dependent on the intensity of exercise. SV (

Figure 12.12B

) remains relatively constant or decreases slightly during low-intensity contractions and decreases during high-intensity contractions. There is a marked increase in SV immediately following the cessation of high-intensity contractions (

Lind et al., 1964

;
 
Smith et al., 1993

). This is the same rebound rise in recovery as seen in a-vO
2
diff, minute ventilation (


), and
 

 (see
 
Figure 4.5

). The reduction in SV during high-intensity contractions probably results from both a decreased preload and an increased afterload. Preload is decreased because of high intrathoracic pressure, which compresses the vena cava and thus decreases the return of venous blood to the heart. Because arterial BP is markedly elevated during static contractions (increased afterload), less blood is ejected at a given force of contraction. HR (

Figure 12.12C

) increases during static exercise. The magnitude and the rate of the increase in HR depend on the intensity of contraction. The greater the intensity, the greater the HR response.




Static exercise is characterized by a rapid increase in both systolic pressure and diastolic pressure, termed the

 pressor response
, which appears to be inappropriate for the amount of work produced by the contracting muscle (

Lind et al., 1964

). Since both systolic and diastolic pressures increase, there is a marked increase in MAP (

Figure 12.12D

) (

Donald et al., 1967

;
 
Lind et al., 1964

;
 
Seals et al., 1985

;
 
Tuttle and Horvath, 1957

). As in any muscular work, static exercise increases metabolic demands of the active muscle. However, in static work, high intramuscular tension results in mechanical constriction of the blood vessels, which impedes blood flow to the muscle. The reduction in muscle blood flow during

 static exercise results in a buildup of local by-products of metabolism. These chemical by-products (H
+
, adenosine diphosphate, and others) stimulate sensory nerve endings, which leads to a pressor reflex, causing a rise in MAP (pressor response). This rise is substantially larger than the increase during aerobic exercise requiring similar energy expenditure (

Asmussen, 1981

;
 
Hanson and Nagle, 1985

). Notice in
 
Figure 12.12D

 that holding a handgrip dynamometer at 20% MVC for 5 minutes resulted in an increase of 20–30 mmHg in MAP, and holding 50% MVC for 2 minutes caused a 50 mmHg increase in MAP!






Pressor Response
 The rapid increase in both systolic pressure and diastolic pressure during static exercise.





Total peripheral resistance, indicated by TPR in
 
Figure 12.12E

, decreases during static exercise, although not to the extent seen in dynamic aerobic exercise. The smaller decrease in resistance helps to explain the higher BP response to static contractions. The high BP generated during static contractions helps overcome resistance to blood flow from mechanical occlusion. Because the SBP and the HR both increase during static exercise, there is a large increase in myocardial oxygen consumption and thus rate-pressure product. This is often a concern in clinical populations such as cardiac rehabilitation patients.

 summarizes cardiovascular responses to static exercise.



Blood Flow during Static Contractions


Blood flow to the working muscle is impeded during static contractions because of the mechanical constriction of the blood vessel supplying the contracting muscle (Freund et al., 1979
; Sjogaard et al., 1988
). Figure 12.13
 depicts blood flow in the quadriceps muscle when a 5 and 25% MVC contraction were held to fatigue. The 5% MVC load could be held for 30 minutes; the 25% load could be held for only 4 minutes. Quadriceps blood flow is greater during the 5% MVC, suggesting that at 25% MVC, there is considerable impedance to blood flow. In fact, blood flow during the 25% MVC load was very close to resting levels despite the metabolic work done by the muscle. The response occurring during recovery suggests that when contraction ceases, a mechanical occlusion to the muscle is released. The marked increase in blood flow during recovery compensates for the reduced flow during sustained contraction. The relative force at which blood flow is impeded varies greatly among different muscle groups (Lind and McNichol, 1967
; Rowell, 1993
).

Mechanical constriction also occurs during dynamic aerobic exercise. However, the alternating periods of muscular contraction and relaxation during rhythmical activity allow—and, indeed, encourage—blood flow, especially through the venous system.



Comparison of Aerobic and Static Exercise



Figure 12.14
 compares the HR and the BP responses to fatiguing handgrip (static) exercise (30% MVC held to fatigue) and a maximal treadmill (incremental aerobic) test to fatigue. The incremental aerobic exercise is
 characterized by a large increase in the HR, which contributes to an increased cardiac output. The treadmill exercise response also shows a modest increase in the SBP and a relatively stable or decreasing DBP. Aerobic exercise is said to impose a “volume load” on the heart. Increased venous return leads to increased SV, which contributes to an increased cardiac output. In contrast, fatiguing static exercise is characterized by a modest increase in the HR, but a dramatic increase in the BP (pressor response
). Mean BP increases as a result of increased SBP and DBP. Static exercise is said to impose a “pressure load” on the heart. Increased MAP means that the heart must pump harder to overcome the pressure in the aorta.

Cardiovascular Responses to Dynamic Resistance Exercise




Weight-lifting or resistance exercise includes a combination of dynamic and static contractions (Hill and Butler, 1991
; MacDougall et al., 1985
). At the beginning of the lift, a static contraction exists until muscle force exceeds the load to be lifted and movement occurs, leading to a dynamic concentric (shortening) contraction as the lift continues. This is then followed by a dynamic eccentric (lengthening) contraction during the lowering phase (McCartney, 1999
). A static component is always associated with gripping the barbell. During dynamic resistance exercise, cardiorespiratory system responses are dissociated from the energy demand. In contrast, during dynamic endurance activity, responses in the cardiorespiratory system are directly related to the use of oxygen for energy production. In part, the reason for this dissociation between oxygen use and cardiovascular response to resistance exercise is that much of the energy required for resistance exercise comes from anaerobic (without oxygen) sources. Another important difference between resistance exercise and aerobic exercise is the mechanical constriction of blood flow during resistance exercise because of the static nature of the contraction.



The magnitude of the cardiovascular response to resistance exercise depends on the intensity of the load (the weight lifted) and the number of repetitions performed. Cardiovascular responses also depend on how the load and repetitions are combined.



Varying Load/Constant Repetitions


As expected, cardiovascular responses are greater when heavier loads are lifted, assuming the number of repetitions is constant (Fleck, 1988
; Fleck and Dean, 1987
). For example, as shown in Figure 12.15
, when participants performed 10 repetitions of arm curling exercises with dumbbells of three different weights (identified as light, moderate, and heavy), the SBP was highest at the completion of the heaviest set (Wescott and Howes, 1983
). The SBP increased 16, 22, and 34% during the light, moderate, and heavy sets, respectively. The DBP, measured by auscultation, did not change significantly with any of the sets. There is disagreement about the DBP response to resistance exercise; some authors report an increase, while others report no change
 (Fleck, 1988
; Fleck and Dean, 1987
; Wescott and Howes, 1983
). These discrepancies may reflect differences in measurement techniques (auscultation versus intra-arterial assessment) and timing of the measurement.

.




Varying Load/Repetitions to Failure


A different pattern of response is seen when a given load is performed to fatigue, which lifters typically call failure. In this case, the individual performs maximal work regardless of the load. Figure 12.16
 shows the cardiovascular response at the completion of leg extension exercise performed to failure. Participants performed 50, 80, and 100% of their one repetition maximum (1-RM) as many times as they could, and cardiovascular variables were recorded at the end of each set (Falkel et al., 1992
). Participants could perform the 100% load only one time, of course, but they could perform the 80 and 50% loads an average of 8 and 15 times, respectively. Thus, the greatest amount (volume) of work was performed when the lightest load was lifted the greatest number of times. Cardiac output at the completion of the set was highest when the lightest load was lifted for the most repetitions—that is, when the total work was greatest (Figure 12.16A
).

The SV at the end of a set was similar for each condition (

Figure 12.16B

) and was slightly below resting levels. This is in contrast to significant increases in the SV that occur during aerobic exercise. Thus, dynamic resistance exercise does not produce the SV overload of dynamic aerobic exercise (

Hill and Butler, 1991

;
 
McCartney, 1999

). The HR was highest after completion of the set using the lightest load and lifting it the most times (

Figure 12.16C

). The HR was lowest when a single repetition using the heaviest weight was performed, and hence when the least amount of work was done. HRs between 130 and 160 b·min
−1
 have been reported during resistance exercise (

Hill and Butler, 1991

). There is some evidence that the HR and the BP attained at fatigue are the same when loads between 60 and 100% of 1-RM are used, regardless of the number of times the load can be performed (

Nau et al., 1990

).



Constant Load/Repetitions to Failure


When the load is heavy, MAP and HR increase with succeeding repetitions in a set to failure (Fleck and Dean, 1987
; MacDougall et al., 1985
). Figure 12.17A
 shows the MAP, measured intra-arterially, during a set of leg press exercises that represented 95% of 1-RM; Figure 12.17B
 shows the HR during these exercises. In this study, peak SBP averaged 320 mmHg, and peak DBP averaged 250 mmHg! The dramatic increase in BP during dynamic resistance exercise results from the mechanical compression of blood vessels and performance of the Valsalva maneuver (as explained in Chapter 10
). The TPR is higher during dynamic resistance exercise than during dynamic aerobic exercise because of the vasoconstriction caused by the pressor reflex. In fact, some studies have reported a slight increase in the TPR during resistance
 exercise, rather than the decrease observed with aerobic exercise (Lentini et al., 1993
; McCartney, 1999
; Miles et al., 1987
). Myocardial oxygen consumption and thus the rate-pressure product can reach extremely high levels because of the tachycardia and the exaggerated SBP response. Dynamic resistance exercise also causes large (about 15%) but transient decreases in plasma volume (Hill and Butler, 1991
).

Cardiovascular responses to resistance exercise are summarized in
 
Table 12.1

.




Resistance exercises are generally undertaken to enhance muscle size or to improve muscular health (strength or endurance). The goal is not to stress the cardiovascular system. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to adequately compare cardiovascular responses to resistance exercise among different populations (male versus female, children versus adult, and young versus older adults). Therefore, this exercise category is not included in the following sections.





Male-Female Cardiovascular Differences During Exercise




The pattern of cardiovascular responses to aerobic exercise is similar for both sexes, although the magnitude of the response may vary for some variables. Many of the differences in cardiovascular responses between the sexes are related to differences in body size and structure.


Short-Term, Light to Moderate and Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Exercise


Females have a higher cardiac output and HR, but a lower SV, than males during submaximal exercise when work is performed at the same absolute workload (Åstrand et al., 1964
; Becklake et al., 1965
; Freedson et al., 1979
). The higher HR more than compensates for the lower SV in females, resulting in the higher cardiac output seen at the same absolute workload. Thus, if a male and a female perform the same exercise, the female will typically be stressing the cardiovascular system to a greater extent (Figure 12.18
). This relative disadvantage to women results from several factors. First, females typically are smaller than males; they have a smaller heart and less muscle mass. Second, they have a lower oxygen-carrying capacity than males. Finally, they typically have lower aerobic capacity (

).









FIGURE 12.18
 Male and Female Exercising Together.





When males and females perform the same relative workload (both working at the same percentage of their
 

), a different pattern emerges. The importance of distinguishing between relative and absolute workloads is shown in
 
Figure 12.19

. This figure shows results from a study that compared the cardiovascular response of men and women to the same absolute work rate (600 kg·min
−1
) and the same relative work rate

 (50%
 

). Although cardiac output was higher in women during the same absolute work rate, it is lower for women when the same relative work rate was performed (

Figure 12.19A

). The SV (

Figure 12.19B

) was lower in women than in men whether the work was expressed on an absolute or relative basis. Notice that the values are very similar for both conditions, suggesting that the SV has plateaued as would be expected at 50%
 

 in both conditions. The difference in HR between the sexes (

Figure 12.19C

) was smaller when exercise was performed at the same relative work rate.

Males and females display the same pattern of response for BP; however, males tend to have a higher SBP at the same relative workloads (

Deschenes et al., 2006

;
 
Malina and Bouchard, 2004

;
 
Ogawa et al., 1992

). Much of the difference in the magnitude of the BP response is attributable to differences in resting SBP. The DBP response to submaximal exercise is very similar for both sexes. Thus, MAP is slightly greater in males during submaximal work at the same relative workload. The pattern of response for resistance is similar for males and females, although males typically have a lower resistance because of their greater cardiac output. Males and females both exhibit cardiovascular drift during heavy, prolonged submaximal exercise. Changes in plasma volume appear to be greater in men than in women at the same absolute submaximal exercise intensity (

Deschenes et al., 2006

).



Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum


The cardiovascular response to incremental exercise is similar for both sexes, although again there are differences in the maximal values attained. Maximal oxygen consumption (

) is higher for males than for females. When 

 is expressed in absolute values (L·min−1
), males typically have values that are 40–60% higher than in females (Åstrand, 1952
; Sparling, 1980
). When differences in body size are considered and 

 values are expressed relative to body weight (in mL·kg−1
·min−1
), the differences between the sexes decrease to 20–30%. If differences in body composition are considered and 

 is expressed relative to fat-free mass (in mL·kg−1
 of fat-free mass per minute), the difference between the sexes is reduced to 0–15% (Sparling, 1980
). Reporting 

 relative to fat-free mass is important in terms of understanding the influence of adiposity and fat-free mass on 

. However, it is not a very practical way to express 

 because, in reality, consuming oxygen only in relation to fat-free mass is not an option. Individuals cannot leave their fat mass behind when exercising.




Figure 12.20

 represents the distribution of
 

 values for males and females expressed per kilogram of weight and per kilogram of fat-free mass. This figure demonstrates the important point that there is considerable variability in
 

 for both sexes. Thus, although males generally have a higher
 

, some females will have a higher
 

 than the average male.

, expressed in relative terms (

) and absolute terms (

), and average body weight (

Figure 12.21C

) between the sexes across the age span. Differences in
 

 are largely explained by the differences in the size of the heart (and thus maximal cardiac output) and the differences in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Males have approximately 6% more red blood cells and 10–15% more hemoglobin

 than females; thus, males have a greater oxygen-carrying capacity (

Åstrand et al., 2003

).

Males typically have a maximal cardiac output that is 30% higher than that of females (

Wells and Plowman, 1983

). Maximal SV is higher for men, but the increase in SV during maximal exercise is achieved by the same mechanisms in both sexes (

Sullivan et al., 1991

). Furthermore, if maximal SV is expressed relative to body weight, there is no difference between the sexes. The maximal HR is similar for both sexes.




Males and females display the same pattern of BP response; however, males attain a higher SBP than females at maximal exercise (

Malina and Bouchard, 2004

;
 
Ogawa et al., 1992

;
 
Wanne and Haapoja, 1988

). The DBP response to maximal exercise is similar for both sexes. Thus, MAP is slightly greater in males at the completion of maximal work. The pattern of response for total peripheral resistance and rate-pressure product is the same for both sexes. Total peripheral resistance is greatly reduced during maximal exercise in both sexes. Because the HR response is similar and the SBP is greater in males, males tend to have a higher rate-pressure product at maximal exercise levels than do females.

 summarizes the differences between the sexes in cardiovascular variables at various exercise levels.

Static Exercis
e


The HR response to static exercise (Figure 12.22A
) is similar in males and females (Misner et al., 1990
). However, as shown in Figure 12.22B
, when a group of young adult, healthy participants held maximal contractions of the handgrip muscles for 2 minutes, the BPs reported for women were significantly lower than those reported for men (Misner et al., 1990
). The SV and cardiac output responses in women during maximal static contraction of the finger flexors were similar to the responses previously reported in men, but no direct comparisons between men and women were made in this study (Smith et al., 1993
).

Cardiovascular Responses of Children and Adolescents to Exercise




The cardiovascular response of children to resistance exercise is similar to that of adults, with the HR and the BP increasing progressively throughout a set (Nau et al., 1990
). However, as stated previously, beyond this there are little data, so resistance exercise responses will not be discussed further in this section.



The pattern of responses in the cardiovascular variables in children and adolescents to aerobic exercise is similar to the pattern in adults. This is not meant to imply that children are simply “little adults.” Often, the actual values are higher or lower than those for adults, but overall, the direction and the relative degree of change are very similar across the age range. Differences can frequently be attributed to differences in body size, structure, and maturity (

Rowland, 2005a

,
 
2005b

).



Short-Term, Light to Moderate and Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Exercise


The pattern of cardiac output response to submaximal aerobic exercise is similar in children and adolescents to adults, with cardiac output increasing rapidly at the onset of exercise and plateauing at a steady state
. However, children have a lower cardiac output than adults at all levels of exercise, primarily because children have a lower SV at any level of exercise (Bar-Or, 1983
; Rowland, 1990
). As children grow and mature, cardiac output and SV increase at rest and during exercise. The lower SV in children is compensated for, to some extent, by a higher HR. The HR response to any given exercise intensity is highest in young children (Bar-Or, 1983
; Cunningham et al., 1984
) and declines as children grow into adolescents (Rowland, 2005a
, 2005b
). Children, adolescents, and adults all exhibit the cardiovascular drift phenomenon of a slight (~15%) progressive rise in HR, simultaneous decreases in SV and MAP, and no change in cardiac output with prolonged exercise (Asano and Hirakoba, 1984
; Rowland, 2005a
). SV in girls is less than that in boys at all levels of exercise (Bar-Or, 1983
).



As always, the magnitude of the cardiovascular response depends on the intensity of the exercise.
 
Table 12.3

 reports the cardiac output, SV, and HR values of children 8–12 years old during treadmill exercise at 40, 53, and 68%
 

 (

Lussier and Buskirk, 1977

). Both cardiac output and HR increase in response to increasing intensities of exercise. SV peaks at 40%
 

 and changes little with increasing exercise intensity. This is consistent with the finding that SV plateaus at 40–50%
 

 in untrained adults (

Åstrand et al., 1964

).




TABLE 12.3
 Cardiovascular Responses in Children to Submaximal Exercise of Various Intensities

 Lussier and Buskirk (1977).





The SBP in children increases during exercise, as it does in adults, and depends on the intensity of the exercise. Boys

 tend to have a higher SBP than girls (

Malina and Bouchard, 2004

). The magnitude of the increase in systolic pressure at submaximal exercise is less in children than in adults (

James et al., 1980

;
 
Wanne and Haapoja, 1988

). The failure of SBP to reach adult levels is probably the result of lower cardiac output in children. As children mature, the increases in the SBP during exercise become greater. Diastolic pressure changes little during exercise but is lower in children than adults (

James et al., 1980

;
 
Wanne and Haapoja, 1988

).




Similar decreases in resistance occur in children as in adults, a result of vasodilation in working muscles. Rate-pressure product increases in children and adolescents during exercise. However, the work of the heart reflects the higher HR and lower SBP for these age groups than for adults. Blood flow through the exercising muscle appears to be greater in children than in adults, resulting in a higher a-vO
2
diff and thereby compensating partially for the lower cardiac output (

Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland and Green, 1988

).



Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum


The cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise to maximum are similar for children, adolescents, and adults; however, children and adolescents achieve a lower , maximal cardiac output, and a lower maximal SV. HR rises in a rectilinear fashion with incremental exercise in children as in adults. However, at approximately 60% 

, it begins to taper. Maximal HR is higher in children than in adults (Cunningham et al., 1984
; Rowland, 1996
, 2005a
).



The maximal oxygen consumption typically attained by youths between the ages of 6 and 18 is shown in
 
Figure 12.23

. As children grow, their ability to take in, transport, and utilize oxygen improves. This improvement represents dimensional and maturational changes—specifically, heart volume, maximal SV, maximal cardiac output, blood volume and hemoglobin concentration, and a-vO
2
diff increase.

The rate of improvement in absolute
 

 (expressed in L·min
−1
) is similar for boys and girls until approximately 12 years of age (

Figure 12.23A

). Maximal oxygen uptake continues to increase in boys until the age of 18; it remains relatively constant in girls between the ages of 14 and 18 years.




When
 

 is expressed relative to body weight (expressed as mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
), it remains relatively constant throughout the years between 8 and 16 for boys (

Figure 12.23B

). However,
 

 (expressed as mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
) tends to decrease in girls as they enter puberty and their adiposity increases (

Figure 12.23B

). As children mature, they also grow, and the developmental changes indicated previously are largely offset if
 

 is described per kilogram of body weight. The large area of overlap for reported values of
 

 for boys and girls in
 
Figure 12.23

 reflects the large variability in
 

 among children and adolescents.




There appears to be a major difference between children/adolescents and adults in terms of the meaning of
 

. In adults,
 

 reflects both physiological function (cardiorespiratory power) and cardiovascular endurance (the ability to perform strenuous, large-muscle exercise for a prolonged period of time) (

Taylor et al., 1955

). In children and adolescents,
 

 is not as directly related to cardiorespiratory endurance as in adults or at least more complex than in adult individuals (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Krahenbuhl et al., 1985

;
 
Rowland, 1990

;
 
Rowland, 2013

).
 
Figure 12.24B

 shows performance as determined by the number of stages or minutes completed in the PACER test (

Léger et al., 1988

). This progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance run (PACER) was described in
 
Chapter 11

. Recall that a higher number of laps completed is positively associated with a higher
 

.
 
Figure 12.24A


 shows that for boys, the mean estimated value of
 

, expressed in mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
, changes very little from age 6 to 18. However, mean performance on the PACER test (

Figure 12.24

B)
 shows a definite linear improvement with age. The girls show the same trend as the boys before puberty, but thereafter,
 

 declines steadily and PACER performance plateaus. Similar results have been reported for treadmill endurance times and other distance runs (

Cumming et al., 1978

) and measured
 

 as well as estimated (

Rowland, 2005a

). Thus, in general, endurance performance improves progressively throughout childhood, at least until puberty, but
 

, expressed relative to body size, does not.

The reason for the weak association between
 

 and endurance performance in young people is unknown. The most frequent suggestion is that children use more aerobic energy (require greater oxygen) than adults at any submaximal pace. This phenomenon is called running economy and is fully discussed in the unit on metabolism (

Chapter 4

). More important than the actual oxygen consumption at a set pace, however, may be the percentage of
 

 that value represents, and more so in children than adolescents (

McCormack et al., 1991

). Other factors that may affect endurance running performance in children and adolescents include body composition, particularly the percentage of body fat; sprint speed, possibly as a reflection of a high percentage of muscle fibers differentiated for speed and power; and various aspects of body size (

Cureton et al., 1991

,
 
1977

;
 
Mayhew and Gifford, 1975

;
 
McVeigh et al., 1995

). There is also the possibility that many children and adolescents are not motivated to perform exercise tests and therefore do not perform well despite high
 

 capabilities.




The BP response is similar for children and adults; however, there are again age- or size-related quantitative differences. For a given level of exercise, a small child responds with a lower SBP and DBP than an adolescent, and an adolescent responds with lower BP than an adult. The lower BP response in young children is consistent with their lower SV response. Typically, boys have a higher peak SBP than girls (

Riopel et al., 1979

;
 
Wade and Freund, 1990

). This difference too is most likely attributable to differences in SV. Myocardial oxygen consumption at maximal exercise increases as children grow—predominantly through the influence of higher maximal SBP since maximal HR is stable until late adolescence.

Static Exercis
e


Children’s and adolescents’ cardiovascular responses to static exercise appear to be similar to adults’ (Rowland, 2005a
, 2005b
). Table 12.5
 presents data from two studies that investigated cardiovascular responses to 3 minutes of leg extension exercise at 30% of MVC. One study tested young men between the ages of 25 and 34 (Bezucha et al., 1982
) and the other young boys aged 7–12 (Rowland et al., 2006
). In both studies, static exercise resulted in typical responses: an increased MAP, an elevated HR, a decreased SV, and a small rise in cardiac output. Similarly, a study that compared premenarcheal girls and young women found no differences in cardiovascular responses to 3 minutes of 30% MVC of the handgrip muscles (Smith et al., 2000
).

Cardiovascular Responses of Older Adults to Exercise




Aging is associated with diminishing function in many systems of the body. Thus, aging is characterized by a decreased ability to respond to physiological stress (Skinner, 1993
). There is considerable debate, though, about how much loss of function is inevitably related to age, how much is related to disease, and how much can be attributed to a sedentary lifestyle often accompanying aging. Each of these factors causes decrements in function, but for an individual, it is often difficult to know which one or which combination may cause an observed change.



Many older adults remain active into their later years and perform amazing athletic feats. For example, Mavis Lindgren began an exercise program of walking in her early 60s. She slowly increased her training volume and began jogging. At age 70, she completed her first marathon. In the next 12 years, she raced in over 50 marathons (

Nieman, 1990

). Many studies of physical activity suggest that by remaining active in the older years, individuals can markedly reduce loss of cardiovascular function, even if they do not run a marathon.



Short-Term, Light to Moderate and Long-Term, Moderate to Heavy Submaximal Exercise


At the same absolute submaximal workload, cardiac output and SV are lower in older adults, but HR is higher than in younger adults. The pattern of systolic and diastolic pressure is the same for younger and older individuals. The difference in resting BP is maintained throughout the exercise, so that older individuals have a higher SBP, DBP, and MAP at any given level of exercise (Ogawa et al., 1992
). The higher BP response is related to a higher TPR in older individuals, resulting from a loss of elasticity in the blood vessels. Because HR and SBP are higher for any given level of exercise in older adults, myocardial oxygen consumption and thus rate-pressure product are also higher in older individuals than in younger adults.


Incremental Aerobic Exercise to Maximum


Cardiorespiratory responses to incremental exercise change with advancing age (Edvardsen et al., 2013
). Maximal cardiac output is lower in older individuals than in younger adults. This results from a lower maximal HR and a lower maximal SV. Maximal SV decreases with advancing age, and the decline is of similar magnitude for both men and women, although women have a much smaller maximal SV initially. Maximal HR decreases with age but does not vary significantly between the sexes. A decrease of approximately 10% per decade, starting at approximately age 30, has been reported for 

 in sedentary and active adults (Åstrand, 1960
; Heath et al., 1981
; Wilson and Tanka, 2000
). There is some indication that the rate of decline in 

 is greater in men than in women (Stathokostas et al., 2004
; Weiss et al., 2006
). Figure 12.21A
 and B
 depict the change in 

 from childhood to 75 years of age.



Like resting BP, SBP and DBP responses to maximal aerobic exercise are typically higher in older individuals than in younger individuals of similar fitness (

Ogawa et al., 1992

). Maximal SBP may be 20–50 mmHg higher in older individuals and maximal DBP 15–20 mmHg higher. As a result of an elevated SBP and DBP, MAP is considerably higher at maximal exercise in older than in younger adults.




TPR decreases during aerobic exercise in older adults but not to the same extent as in younger individuals. This difference is a consequence of the loss of elasticity of the connective tissue in the vasculature that accompanies aging. Since the decrease in maximal HR for older individuals is greater than the increase in maximal SBP when compared to younger adults, older individuals have a lower rate-pressure product at maximal exercise.
 
Table 12.6

 presents typical cardiovascular values at maximal exercise in young and old adults of both sexes.

 Cardiovascular Responses to Maximal Exercise in Young and Older Adults

 Ogawa et al. (1992).




Static Exercis
e


Many studies have described the cardiovascular responses to static exercise in older adults (Goldstraw and Warren, 1985
; Petrofsky and Lind, 1975
; Sagiv et al., 1988
; VanLoan et al., 1989
). As an example, Figure 12.25
 depicts the cardiovascular responses of young and old men to sustained handgrip exercise over a range of submaximal static workloads (VanLoan et al., 1989
). Note that cardiac output (Figure 12.25A
) and SV (Figure 12.25B
) values are lower than normally reported, because of the measurement technique. However, the relative differences between the responses of the young and the older participants show that cardiac output, SV, and HR (Figure 12.25C
) were lower for the older men than for the younger men at each intensity. In contrast, BP responses (Figure 12.25D
 and E
) were higher for the older men at each intensity. As with dynamic aerobic exercise, the differences in the cardiovascular responses between
 the two age groups are probably due to an age-related increase in resistance due to a loss of elasticity in the vasculature and a decreased ability of the myocardium to stretch and contract forcibly (VanLoan et al., 1989
). The rate-pressure product (Figure 12.25F
) was higher for the younger participants than for the older participants at 30, 45, and 60% MVC. The small difference in rate-pressure product reflected a higher HR in younger participants at each intensity of contraction, which was not completely offset by a lower SBP in the younger participants.

SUMMARY





1.
 During short-term, light to moderate aerobic exercise, cardiac output (


), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and rate-pressure product (RPP) increase rapidly at the onset of exercise and reach steady state within approximately 2 minutes. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remains relatively unchanged, and resistance decreases rapidly and then plateaus.




2.
 During long-term, moderate to heavy aerobic exercise,
 

, SV, HR, SBP, and RPP increase rapidly. Once steady state is achieved, cardiac output remains relatively constant owing to the downward drift of SV and the upward drift of HR. SBP and resistance may also drift downward during prolonged, heavy work. This cardiovascular drift is associated with rising body temperature.




3.
 During incremental exercise to maximum,
 

, HR, SBP, and RPP increase in a rectilinear fashion with increasing workload. SV increases initially and then plateaus at a workload corresponding to approximately 40–50%
 

 in normally active adults and children. DBP remains relatively constant throughout an incremental exercise test. Resistance decreases rapidly with the onset of exercise and reaches its lowest value at maximal exercise.




4.
 The decrease in resistance during aerobic exercise has two important implications. It allows greater blood flow to the working muscles and keeps blood pressure from rising excessively. The increase in cardiac output would produce a much greater rise in blood pressure if it were not for the fact that there is a simultaneous decrease in resistance.




5.
 The highest oxygen consumption during an incremental test may or may not represent an actual maximal value. The term
 

 is used to represent the highest value obtained during the test if the tester is not certain that a true maximal value was achieved. Specific criteria should be used to determine whether the test is truly a maximal test.




6.
 Maximal oxygen uptake may be limited by any system (or step) along the pathway of bringing oxygen into the body and delivering it to the mitochondria for the production of ATP. Although factors in each of these systems may limit the
 

, research suggests that cardiac output is the limiting factor in
 

 in most individuals.




7.
 Blood volume decreases during aerobic exercise. Most of the decrease occurs within the first 10 minutes of activity and depends on exercise intensity. A decrease of 10% of blood volume is not uncommon.




8.
 SV initially increases during dynamic aerobic exercise and then plateaus at a level that corresponds to 40–50%
 

. The increase in SV results from changes in end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV). EDV increases primarily because the active muscle pump returns blood to the heart. ESV decreases owing to augmented contractility of the heart, thus ejecting more blood and leaving less blood in the ventricle.




9.
 The pattern of cardiovascular response is the same for both sexes. However, males have a higher cardiac output, SV, and SBP at maximal exercise. Additionally, males have a higher
 

. Most of these differences are attributable to differences in body size and heart size between the sexes and to the greater hemoglobin concentration of males.




10.
 The pattern of cardiovascular response in children and adolescents is similar to the adult response. However, children have a lower
 

, SV, and SBP at an absolute workload and at maximal exercise. Most of these differences are attributable to differences in body size and heart size.




11.
 As adults age, their cardiovascular responses change. Maximal
 

, SV, HR, and
 

 decrease. Maximal SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increase.




12.
 Static exercise is characterized by modest increases in HR and
 

 and exaggerated increases in SBP, DBP, and MAP, known as the pressor response.




13.
 Dynamic resistance exercise results in a modest increase in
 

, an increase in HR, little change or a decrease in SV, and a large increase in blood pressure.
