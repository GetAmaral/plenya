 Muscular Training Principles and Adaptations








OBJECTIVES




After studying the chapter, you should be able to:






Apply each of the training principles to the development of a resistance training program.






Describe muscular adaptations to resistance training.






Identify similarities and differences in training adaptations between males and females, children and adults, and young and older fitness participants.






Discuss the relationship between muscle function and low-back pain.








Introduction




The previous chapters have discussed how isolated muscle fibers and intact muscles contract to produce coordinated movement. This chapter discusses specific applications of the training principles for the development of muscular fitness and the training adaptations that result from an exercise training program. The final section applies this information to the problems of low-back pain.



Although a training program can be developed using static contractions, in reality such programs are rare. Therefore, this chapter focuses on dynamic resistance and isokinetic training programs. The term
 resistance training program
 is used inclusively to encompass dynamic resistance and isokinetic training unless otherwise specified.



Overview of Resistance Training



Resistance training
 is a systematic program of exercises involving the exertion of force against a load, with the goal of developing strength, endurance, and/or hypertrophy of the muscular system (Davies and Barnes, 1972
). It is commonly called weight training
. Resistance training is a recommended component of a well-rounded fitness program for healthy children, adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, and older adults. A resistance training program should be individualized, be progressive, and involve all the major muscle groups (American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM], 2009
; Haskell et al., 2007
; Nelson et al., 2007
).

The scientific and medical community accepts that muscular strength is a necessary trait for health, functional ability, athletic performance, and an enhanced quality of life. Resistance training is acknowledged as an effective way to develop musculoskeletal health and is now routinely recommended by health and fitness professionals. Especially when incorporated as part of a comprehensive fitness program, resistance training helps reduce the risk factors associated with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon cancer; maintains muscle mass in weight loss; and improves dynamic stability and preserves functional capacity (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Bird et al., 2005

). The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) position stand titled “Progression Models in Resistance Training for Healthy Adults” provides guidelines for progression models of resistance training that can be applied to novice, intermediate, and advanced training levels (

ACSM, 2009

).




When done under skilled supervision with proper instruction in form, breathing, body mechanics, and prescription of loads, resistance training can be enjoyed by all individuals. It carries a relatively low risk of harm for prepubescent children (

Behm et al., 2008

;
 
Faigenbaum and Myer, 2010a

;
 
Faigenbaum et al., 2009

,
 
2015

). Resistance training is also appropriate and effective in older adults as long as training principles are properly applied (

Borde et al., 2015

;
 
Nelson et al., 2007

;
 
Ribeiro et al., 2014

;
 
Steib et al., 2010

).





Application of the Training Principles




The training principles for a safe and effective resistance training program are the same as for other types of exercise programs.


Specificity


As in any training program, a plan for muscular fitness must be specific to the individual’s goals. Individuals may pursue resistance training as part of a comprehensive fitness program, to improve overall health, to enhance functional capacity, to change personal appearance, or to improve athletic performance. For muscular fitness, the goals of a resistance training program may include the development of muscular strength, hypertrophy, power, muscular endurance, or any combination of the above. Of course, these goals overlap. A person who gains muscle mass (hypertrophy), for example, is certainly stronger. However, the resistance training program should emphasize the goal that is most important to the individual. Many individuals focus on different components of muscular fitness at different times as part of a well-designed periodization plan.



Muscles respond specifically to different types of contraction and loads imposed. Athletes in many sports, including basketball, football, hockey, volleyball, etc., use dynamic resistance programs to increase muscle strength, mass, and power. Athletes in other sports, including swimming, are more likely to use isokinetic training programs to develop strength through a specified range of motion.




The specificity training principle applies to the muscle groups being trained, the type of contraction performed, the selection of single- or multiple-joint exercises, and the velocity of contraction. Because resistance training is specific to the muscle groups being trained, a resistance training program should include at least one exercise for all the major muscle groups of the body. It is recommended that all resistance training programs include a concentric and eccentric component. Although most resistance training programs should include single-joint and multiple-joint exercises, programs designed to develop muscular power should emphasize multiple-joint exercises (

ACSM, 2009

).




Specificity also applies to the velocity of contraction in isokinetic exercises (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Kawamori and Haff, 2004

;
 
Perrin, 1993

). Exercise performed at slow velocities generally increases torque specific to the training velocity. Training at high velocities generally increases strength at and below the exercise velocity and is thus not as specific as slow-velocity training. Furthermore, it is a misconception that the velocity of isokinetic exercise should be specific to athletic events (

Perrin, 1993

). In reality, the angular velocities of joint movements in

 many athletic events (such as throwing) far exceed what can be performed during isokinetic exercise.



Overload


Successfully applying the overload principle in resistance training requires the manipulation of intensity (load), volume, frequency, and rest intervals. The intensity
 of the workout can be expressed as a relative load (a percentage of an individual’s 1-RM) or an absolute load (a specific amount of weight). Volume
 is a measure of total amount of work done in an exercise session and can be expressed in several ways, for example, total number of repetitions, number of repetitions × number of sets, or number of repetitions × number of sets × intensity (Wernbom et al., 2007
). Table 19.1
 provides recommendations for the manipulation of these variables depending on the individual’s goal and fitness level. The amount of stress, or load, applied to the muscle largely determines the response of the muscle. A muscle exposed to near-maximal load will develop greater strength than a muscle experiencing many repetitions of a lighter load. In contrast, a muscle that performs many repetitions of a lighter load will develop relatively more muscular endurance than one exposed to a small number of near-maximal repetitions. There is an inverse relationship between the load (weight) that can be lifted and the number of repetitions that can be performed. By definition, the most weight that can be lifted one time is the one-repetition maximum (1 rep max; 1-RM)
. Figure 19.1
 provides guidelines for estimating the number of repetitions that are possible at various
 loads, expressed as a percentage of 1-RM (Baechle et al., 2000
). When using Figure 19.1
, keep in mind that the number of repetitions that can be performed at any given load is only an estimate. The actual number of repetitions that can be performed at any given load varies among individuals (resistance-trained athletes often can exceed the predicted repetitions) and among muscle groups.Complete the Check your Comprehension box to use the information presented in this section.

Historically, programs based on the overload principle began in 1948 when DeLorme and Watkins introduced
 progressive resistance exercise
. The DeLorme and Watkins program uses 30 repetitions per training session for each muscle group exercised. The 30 repetitions are broken down into 3 sets of 10 repetitions (reps) each, as follows:



Set 1 = 10 repetitions at 50% of 10-RM


Set 2 = 10 repetitions at 75% of 10-RM


Set 3 = 10 repetitions at 100% of 10-RM



Since the 1950s, considerable research has been done to determine the optimal number of repetitions and sets, the workload, and the frequency for developing muscular strength, endurance, and power. This research has led to the development of many training systems. No single combination of repetitions and sets produces the best results; however, the ideal number of sets depends on the individual’s goals and differences.




Modern progressive resistance training programs often address goals along a “strength-endurance” continuum. The proper manipulation of repetitions, intensity, sets, and rest periods is important in achieving desired goals. Campos et al. (2002) designed a study that investigated three different training regimes:




1.
 Low repetitions (3- to 5-RM); high intensity; 4 sets; 3-minute rests




2.
 Medium repetitions (9- to 11-RM); intermediate intensity; 3 sets; 2-minute rests




3.
 High repetitions (20- to 28-RM); low intensity; 2 sets; 1-minute rest




The authors found that maximal strength improved significantly more with the low-repetition group, but the maximal number of repetitions that could be performed at 60% of 1-RM improved the most in the high-repetition group. Maximal aerobic capacity and time to exhaustion on a graded exercise test increased only in the high-repetition group. In contrast, all three major groups of muscle fibers increased in the low- and intermediate-repetition group but not in the high-repetition group (Campos et al., 2002). These findings confirm that physiological adaptations to resistance training are dependent upon the design of the training program and the manipulation of the variables that determine overload, highlighting the importance of identifying an individual’s goal and designing a specific resistance training program to meet that goal.




To elicit improvements in both muscular strength and endurance, the ACSM recommends that a minimum of one set of 8–12 repetitions be performed with each of the major muscle groups 2–3 d·wk
−1
 (

ACSM, 2009

). It may be more appropriate for older or frailer individuals to perform 10–15 repetitions per muscle group (

Nelson et al., 2007

). Although greater gains in strength may result from performing more than one set of exercise, for the general public, the incremental strength gains from additional sets are offset by the longer period needed to complete the exercise and the increased risk of orthopedic injury. A meta-analysis compiled evidence that increasing training volume leads to improved muscle hypertrophy. This dose-response curve was characterized by an increase in the rate of hypertrophy in the initial part of the curve, followed by peak rate of hypertrophy and, in turn, followed by a plateau (

Wernbom et al., 2007

). Thus, athletes and individuals wishing to optimize muscular fitness (and hypertrophy in particular) may benefit from performing more than one set; this is reflected in current recommendations (see
 
Table 19.1

).




Resistance training programs need to address multiple considerations. Core exercises develop the strength and endurance of the muscles of the trunk and pelvis, which are responsible for body stability and essential for most human movement. Core strengthening has received greater emphasis in recent years, and it is currently recommended that all resistance training programs include core strengthening exercises

.




To avoid fatigue, it is recommended that exercises be arranged in a specific order, alternating lower-body with upper-body exercises. This tactic allows the muscles to recover between exercises or exercise sessions. Generally, large muscle groups should be exercised first, followed by smaller muscle groups. For example, if an exerciser wants to work the latissimus dorsi (lats) and the biceps, the lats should be worked first (pulldowns), because they involve a larger muscle group. This approach helps ensure that the fatigue of the smaller muscle group (the biceps) does not limit the work that can be performed by the larger muscle group (the lats).Complete the Check Your Comprehension2 box to determine your understanding of sequencing strength training exercises.

Check your answer in Appendix C.








The length of rest periods between exercise sets is also related to the overload placed on the muscles. If the goal is maximal strength gains, relatively long (several minutes) rest periods should be used between sets. If endurance is the primary goal, shorter rest periods should be used (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Baechle et al., 2000

).




The optimal frequency of resistance training also depends on the individual’s goals and training status. Additionally, frequency varies depending on training stage (periodization). Obviously, a competitive bodybuilder trains more frequently than an adult fitness participant hoping to derive the health-related benefits of resistance training. The ACSM recommends strengthening exercises at least 2 days a week to achieve the health-related benefits of such exercises (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Haskell et al., 2007

). Additional training leads to additional benefits. Training from 2 to 4 days a week appears to be most popular with weight lifters. Twice a week is considered the minimum necessary to improve muscular strength; training less than twice a week may predispose the individual to muscle soreness and injury. Athletes who train 4 days a week often follow a program that alternates an upper-body workout day with a lower-body workout day, so that 2 days a week are devoted to each anatomical area.




Competitive resistance-trained athletes often follow a training program in which they train 3 or 4 days consecutively and then take a day off. With such a program, they follow a split routine: each muscle group is exercised only twice a week. A split routine emphasizes a single muscle group in a workout. This muscle group is then rested for 48–72 hours. A variation of this program is the double-split routine in which two exercise sessions are performed on each workout day.




The frequency of training also depends on the individual’s periodization plan. An athlete may engage in resistance training 4–6 d·wk
−1
 in the general preparatory stage (off-season), 3 or 4 d·wk
−1
 in the specific preparatory stage (preseason), 1 or 2 d·wk
−1
 in the competitive season (in-season), and 1–3 d·wk
−1
 in the transition (active rest) stage of periodization.




The duration—the amount of time spent in the weight room—depends largely on the number of repetitions, the number of sets, and the number of exercises performed. In itself, time spent on resistance training is not a critical component of the exercise prescription.




Overloading for prepubescent children should involve the same factors as outlined for adults, with some modification. A beginning program should stress learning proper form, techniques, and safety considerations, such as spotting (

Behm et al., 2008

;
 
Faigenbaum and Myer, 2010b

;
 
Faigenbaum et al., 2015

). The equipment should fit the child, which may mean that some exercise machines (designed primarily for adult males) should not be used. Exercises should include major muscle groups and work both agonist and antagonist muscles at each joint.





Figure 19.2

 outlines guidelines from the International Consensus Statement for the progression of a resistance training program based on each athlete’s resistance training skill competency (RTSC) (

Lloyd et al., 2014

). Children should begin with a program consisting of 1–2 sets early in the training program while skill development is emphasized. In the early phase, it is recommended that intensity be less than or equal to 50% of 1-RM. As children become more skilled, it is reasonable to increase to 2–4 sets of 6–12 reps at up to 80% of 1-RM. A frequency of 2 or 3 d·wk
−1
 is recommended at this point. Highly skilled young athletes may undertake a resistance training program that involves multiple sets using weights of more than 85% of 1-RM. Historically, there has been concern about having children perform maximal lifts. However, studies (see Focus on Application: Clinically Relevant box) have shown that children can safely perform a 1-RM test to guide a lifting program.Please review the Check your Comprehension 3 – Case Study box to ensure your understanding of the use of resistance training to improve health.

Older adults also benefit from resistance exercise in many ways (including improved overall health, strength, and functional ability). Many professional organizations, including the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association, recommend resistance training for older individuals. Current recommendations for older individuals include 1 set of 10–15 repetitions of exercises involving all the major muscle groups at least 2 days a week (

Nelson et al., 2007

). However, research evidence suggests that older individuals seeking more strength gain have superior adaptations to 3-set resistance training than with 1-set training in leg exercises (

Paulsen et al., 2003

;
 
Steib et al., 2010

).

Is It Safe to Determine 1-RM in Children?






Establishing a 1-RM load is necessary to develop a resistance training program based on a percentage of maximal capacity. The safety of maximal testing has been explored for many populations, including older adults, and patients with cardiac and pulmonary disease. However, many clinicians and researchers have been cautious about maximal testing in children for fear of injury.







Faigenbaum and colleagues addressed the safety and efficacy of 1-RM testing in healthy children. The participants were healthy boys (
n
 = 64) and girls (
n
 = 32) between the ages of 6.2 and 12.3 years (mean age = 9.3 years). The children had no previous history of resistance training. The children participated in an introductory training session and were taught proper lifting technique for each exercise. Each participant’s 1-RM was then determined for an upper-body exercise (either standing chest press or seated chest press) and a lower-body exercise (either leg extension or leg press). All testing was performed on a weight machine. Before attempting a 1-RM, participants performed 6 reps with a relatively light load, then 3 reps with a heavier load, and finally a series of single reps with increasing loads. If the weight was lifted with proper form, the load was increased by 0.5–2.3 kg. On average, the upper-body 1-RM was determined within 7 trials and the lower-body 1-RM was determined within 11 trials. An NSCA-certified strength and conditioning specialist supervised all testing.








No injuries occurred during the study period, and the participants tolerated all testing well. No complaints of severe muscle soreness were reported. This study supports other smaller studies that found that children can perform 1-RM with no apparent adverse consequences when properly supervised. Since resistance training is becoming more popular and helps increase health and overall fitness in this population, a 1-RM strength test would be beneficial for practitioners to evaluate the effectiveness of a resistance program, assess the participant’s strengths and weaknesses, base the training program on, and motivate progress. Of course, the authors rightly note that any testing with children must be properly supervised and that great care must be taken to teach proper form and ensure that it is used—both during testing and during lifting exercises.

Rest/Recovery/Adaptation


Muscles adapt to the stress placed on them. The most obvious changes that result from a resistance training program are increased muscle strength and size. However, the extent to which muscles adapt to training by becoming stronger and bigger depends on the training program that is followed. For example, at some point during a resistance training program, individuals will realize that their initial 10-repetition maximal weight can now be lifted more than 10 times. This indicates that adaptation has occurred. The rate of adaptation depends on several factors, including rest periods and adequate diet, and the rate may not be the same for all muscle groups trained. The importance of rest (recovery) between exercise sessions to allow for the positive adaptations of exercise training cannot be overemphasized. At least 1 day of rest should follow a day of training for a particular muscle group. Adequate rest periods and alternating heavy and light days are important to allow training adaptations to occur and to prevent injury and soreness. As mentioned earlier, many competitive athletes who lift high volumes allow 72-hour rest periods before training the same muscle group again.




McLester et al. (2003)

 have investigated the time course of muscle endurance recovery in a group of young (18–30 years) and older (50–65 years) men using the number of repetitions that can be performed after a given time as a measure of recovery. The authors report that after 24 hours of recovery, neither of the groups could perform as many repetitions as they did on the initial day of testing. By 48 hours, both groups could perform the same number of repetitions, and by 72 hours, the younger subjects could perform more repetitions. This study reported large individual variability and suggests that individual recovery testing is practical.




Adaptation occurs in children as it does in adults. Careful monitoring of recovery between sessions is probably even more important for children to ensure they rest adequately (at least 48 hours).

Does Supervision of a Strength Training Program Make a Difference?






Many individuals seek the assistance of an exercise professional when implementing their training programs. A personal trainer may provide important information and advice and serve as a motivator. But does the supervision of a training program lead to improved performance? Mazzetti et al. (2000)
 investigated the influence of direct supervision of resistance training on strength performance. Their results suggest that supervision does make a difference. These researchers randomly assigned volunteers with 1–2 years of lifting experience to a supervised group or an unsupervised group for a 12-week training period. The supervised group was trained one-on-one by a personal trainer. The unsupervised group attended one private fitness consultation at the beginning of the training and performed subsequent training without direct supervision, although the personal trainer was present at all training sessions to answer questions concerning the program and to confirm the participants’ adherence to the program. Both groups followed identical periodized resistance training programs consisting of preparatory (10- to 12-RM), hypertrophy (8- to 10-RM), strength (5- to 8-RM), and peaking (3- to 6-RM) phases using free weights and variable resistance equipment. At the end of 12 weeks, there was no difference between the number of training sessions, sets, or repetitions performed per week for the squat and bench exercises. However, the supervised group had lifted more weight per set than the unsupervised group. Both training groups experienced increases in strength, but the supervised group had greater increases than the unsupervised group. These results clearly show that personal training (one-on-one supervision) can affect the strength gains achieved by participants, even if they have been lifting on their own for 1–2 years.

Progression


Once the body has adapted to the current training level, exercise stress should be increased following the overload principle if further adaptations are desired. This principle is the basis of progressive resistance exercise.



Progression should be done gradually. Progression can be accomplished by increasing the load, the repetitions, the number of sets, or the frequency of the workout or by decreasing the rest period between sets. Load and the number of repetitions are the variables most often manipulated. Again, the choice depends largely on the individual’s goals. If strength is the primary goal, then a heavier weight should be used. If endurance is the goal, then the same weight should be lifted more times. Often a combination of these two variables is used. For instance, many people begin with a weight they can lift for 6 repetitions. As they adapt to this stress, they progress to 7 repetitions, then 8 repetitions, and so on. Once they can perform 8–10 repetitions, they increase the weight to something they can again only lift for 6 repetitions. As recommended earlier, a novice lifter should begin by doing more repetitions with a lighter load. Once the body has adapted, the individual can lift heavier weights. Although it has been recommended that acute increases in training volume should be small (2.5–5%), advanced athletes often exceed this recommendation (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Kraemer and Ratamess, 2004

).




As in adults, progression in prepubescent children should be done slowly, especially in terms of intensity. Light to moderate loads of 8- to 15-RM are recommended for the first 2–6 months; after that, heavier loads can be introduced.



Individualization


The first step in individualizing a resistance training program is to determine the participant’s personal goals, followed by evaluating the individual’s current strength level. This assessment is usually done by determining the individual’s one-repetition maximum (1-RM). A 1-RM should be established for each muscle group exercised; it is then used to determine the work intensity. For example, a program may call for an individual to do 6 repetitions per set at 80% of the 1-RM.



The final step is determining the training cycle to be used. This technique is often referred to as periodization (see
 
Chapter 1

), and it is a common step among athletes who use resistance training as an integral part of their training programs for athletic competition. For instance, a player who is conditioning for basketball would follow a different weight training program during the transition phase, general preparatory phase, and specific preparatory phase than during the competitive season. Periodization is also important to individuals who use weight training to maintain health-related muscular fitness; it prevents boredom by regularly changing the training program. Competitive resistance-trained athletes also use periodization techniques to vary their training and to prepare for a peak season.
 
Table 19.2

 provides an outline for developing a training program based on the individualization of the training principles.




TABLE 19.2
 Developing a Resistance Training Program







Even if different individuals follow the same program, training adaptations should be expected at different rates. The principle of individualization states that responses to exercise vary among individuals because of factors unique to the individual. In resistance training, these factors include age, body size and type, initial strength, and, perhaps most importantly, genetic makeup (including fiber-type distribution).




A coach or exercise leader must be sensitive to differences in the rate of individual adaptation because it directly affects the progression of training. Unfortunately, it is a common mistake for a coach to design a program for the entire team and expect everyone’s adaptations to occur at the same rate. The result is often frustration for both the coach and athletes and sometimes even overtraining and/or injuries.




Individually prescribing a resistance training program is probably even more important for prepubescent children than for adults. Children are growing both physiologically and psychologically, and their rate of growth varies greatly. Periodization should be used with children as well as adults. Competition between children should be discouraged

.



Maintenance


Once the desired level of muscular strength and endurance is achieved, it can be maintained by reduced amounts of work as long as the intensity (workload) is maintained; that is, as long as the same weight is lifted, the individual can maintain strength with only one session per week. A reasonable program to maintain muscular strength and endurance would allow individuals to train at a similar workload but with fewer days per week.


Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


Despite the best plans of coaches, training improvements do not occur in a linear fashion. Even with progressively increasing workloads, at times performance will stay at the same level (plateau) or show a decrease (retrogression). The causes may be overtraining or individual differences. If overtraining is suspected, it is wise to include more rest days or include light days in the training regimen. It may also be beneficial to alter the training program using the periodization technique discussed earlier. Once training stops, achieved gains will be reversed.


Warm-Up and Cooldown


A proper warm-up raises body temperature and is often recommended to prevent injury and muscle soreness. Although a warm-up has not been conclusively proven to decrease the incidence of injury, some evidence is consistent with this theory. A higher temperature decreases the viscosity of the joint capsule and increases the speed of muscle contraction and relaxation and enzymatic reactions (Enoka, 1988
).



General and specific warm-ups for resistance training are recommended for weight lifting and isokinetic exercises (

ACSM, 2009

;
 
Perrin, 1993

). A general warm-up involves the major muscles of the body; it is similar to the warm-up used for aerobic exercise and includes activities such as jumping rope or jogging. Specific warm-up activities for weight training involve performing the same lifts that are part of the normal program but at a weight well below the training level. The duration and the intensity of the warm-up should be suited to the individual and the task to be performed. A proper warm-up should cause a rise in core body temperature of 0.5–1.0°C but should not be so strenuous that it causes fatigue. Generally, a warm-up is considered adequate when the individual begins to sweat.




A cooldown period, followed by stretching, is recommended after a training session. Cooling down may prevent muscle soreness and lead to an increase in flexibility, an aspect of muscular fitness often overlooked in resistance training programs. Importantly, cooling down helps prevent venous pooling of blood in the lower extremities.




A warm-up and cooldown are just as important for children as for adults. The same pattern of activities should be followed to increase body temperature and to stretch the muscles.



The Application of Training Principles to Bodybuilding


The sport of competitive bodybuilding has gained great popularity in the past several decades. Furthermore, many individuals engage in resistance training programs to enhance their physique. For these athletes, weight lifting is not only about gaining strength but also about “sculpting” the body. The goals of bodybuilding are to develop superior muscularity and mass, to develop symmetry and harmony between different body parts, and to enhance muscle density and visual separation of muscles. The effect of such programs is shown in Figure 19.3
. To achieve their goals, bodybuilders follow specific training strategies and a strict diet.









FIGURE 19.3
 Bodybuilders.
 A goal of bodybuilding is to “sculpt” the body.





The training strategies for bodybuilding are designed to increase muscle hypertrophy. As discussed earlier, this means that bodybuilders use a very high volume (load times repetitions) of training. The frequency of training varies, but split routines or double splits are most common among competitive bodybuilders. These programs often allow for training on 3 or 4 consecutive days, followed by a day of rest. This schedule allows for more than 48 hours of recovery for each muscle group. The overall cycle of training (periodization) is important to bodybuilders. Bodybuilders commonly do more strength training in the general preparatory phase of their periodization plan to build muscle mass. As the season approaches, the load is reduced and more repetitions are performed in an attempt to gain muscle symmetry

.




Diet is perhaps as important in bodybuilding as an appropriate resistance training program. To enhance muscle definition and promote visual separation of the various muscle groups, bodybuilders maintain a low percentage of body fat through a combination of training and diet. Bodybuilders follow a strict low-fat diet, despite the large number of calories. The practice of
 cutting
 or
 ripping
 refers to the bodybuilder’s attempt to decrease body fat and body water to very low levels before a competition in order to increase muscle definition.

Neuromuscular Adaptations to Resistance Training




Resistance training programs are important for health, fitness, and performance and are widely recommended by leading health organizations. This section addresses neuromuscular training adaptations from resistance training, with an emphasis on changes that occur within muscle tissue. Human skeletal muscle readily adapts to changes in the loading state. The hallmark adaptations to resistance training are increases in muscle strength and size (hypertrophy). Table 19.3
 summarizes neuromuscular adaptations to resistance training.



TABLE 19.3
 Neuromuscular Adaptations to Resistance Training






Muscle Function


Resistance exercise leads to increased muscular strength, endurance, and power. Increased strength is the most obvious result of a resistance training program and the reason many individuals participate in resistance training. Strength gains following a resistance training program vary widely, owing largely to differences in initial strength and the training program. Resistance training at least twice a week improves muscle strength and endurance by approximately 25–100% (Haskell et al., 2007
).



The increase in muscle strength from a resistance training program depends on the particular resistance training program and the muscle group(s) trained.

 shows the percent change in 1-RM during 11 weeks of training using two different training programs—one using 1 set of lower-body exercises and 3 sets of upper-body exercise (1L-3UB) and one using 3 sets of lower-body exercises and 1 set of upper-body exercise (3L-1UB). Notice that the percent changes were greater for the leg exercises (shown in panel A) when a greater number of sets using the lower body was used. However, for the upper-body exercises (panel B), there was no difference between groups, with both training groups increasing arm strength approximately 25% (

Rønnestad et al., 2007

).

The intensity of training also affects the magnitude of adaptation. A 12-week training program that compared low-intensity (15% of 1-RM) and high-intensity (70% 1-RM) contractions while carefully equalizing the total volume of training found that 1-RM quadriceps strength increased by 36% following high-intensity contractions and by 19% with low-intensity contractions (

Holm et al., 2008

).



Muscle Size and Structure


Resistance training increases muscle size and strength. The hypertrophic response to resistance training is affected by the individual factors, such as genetic background, age, and gender, and by the training protocol (Schoenfeld, 2010
). Although changes in muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) have been reported as early as 3 weeks after resistance training, it is likely that these early changes largely reflect muscle swelling due to muscle damage and inflammation (Damas et al., 2015
). Increases in muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) of 7–15% have been reported with 10–14 weeks of resistance training when intensity greater than 60% of 1-RM was used (Holm et al., 2008
; Rønnestad et al., 2007
). The increase in cross-sectional area of the whole muscle reflects an increase in individual muscle fiber cross-sectional area. The increased cross-sectional area of muscle results from hypertrophy of all three muscle fiber types, although the fast glycolytic (FG) fibers exhibit the greatest increase (Bird et al., 2005
). The hypertrophy that occurs is due to an increase
 in the total contractile protein (actin and myosin), in the size and number of the myofibrils per fiber, and in the amount of connective tissue surrounding the muscle fibers (Folland and Williams, 2007
; Schoenfeld, 2010
). Resistance training results in increased collagen synthesis and a strengthening of the connective tissue around the muscle. However, the ratio of connective tissue to skeletal muscle appears relatively consistent between trained and untrained individuals. There is also evidence of increased tendon stiffness with resistance training, which could enhance the rapid application of force (Folland and Williams, 2007
).




Figure 19.5

 presents data from a study in which muscle biopsies were taken from a group of resistance-trained (RT) and untrained (UT) men. Each major subdivision of muscle fiber type clearly had a greater cross-sectional area in the RT group than the untrained group. Furthermore, each of the muscle fiber types could produce greater force in the trained group (

Shoepe et al., 2003

).

Resistance training causes a conversion of muscle fiber subtypes in humans. High-intensity resistance training induces a change from fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) to fast glycolytic (FG) in the early phases of training, with transitions being complete by approximately 12 weeks of training (

Kraemer et al., 1995

). It appears that intensity of training is an important stimulus for this adaptation (

Holm et al., 2008

).




Resistance training can theoretically lead to
 hyperplasia—
an increase in number of muscle fibers. Hyperplasia could occur as a result of muscle fiber splitting or branching with subsequent hypertrophy or myogenesis or a combination of the two. However, the contribution of hyperplasia to increased muscle cross-sectional area (and strength) remains relatively unknown because of measurement difficulties. The exact role of hyperplasia in increased muscle size is highly controversial. However, given the magnitude of changes in muscle size attributable to hypertrophy, it seems that the contribution of hyperplasia to increased muscle cross-sectional area is minimal (

Folland and Williams, 2007

)

.



Neural Adaptations


While it is generally accepted that neural adaptations have a critical role in the increased force production resulting from resistance training, the precise changes that occur are not completely understood. This is, in large part, because of methodological difficulties associated with measuring neurological adaptations (Folland and Williams, 2007
). Resistance training programs typically result in strength gains within the first few weeks despite modest changes in muscle mass, suggesting that neural factors are largely responsible for early strength gains (Gabriel et al., 2006
; Sale, 1988
). Figure 19.6
 illustrates the relative contributions of neural and muscular adaptations to strength gains.

Neural adaptations to resistance training include increased neural drive to the muscle, increased synchronization of the motor units, and an inhibition of the protective mechanism of the Golgi tendon organs (

Fleck and Kraemer, 1987

;
 
Gabriel et al., 2006

). Increased neural drive indicates that greater muscle activation can occur because more motor units can be recruited. Evidence suggests that resistance-trained individuals exhibit greater synchronization—a higher correlation between timing of action potentials of concurrently active motor units that allows for greater force production. Indirect evidence also suggests that resistance training leads to changes in intermuscular coordination of agonists, antagonists, and synergists, which dampens inhibitory reflexes and allows for greater force production. Activation of Golgi tendon organs results in inhibition of the agonist via inhibitory motor neurons, thus providing an important protective reflex that limits excessive force generation within muscle (see
 
Chapter 20

). Resistance training dampens the reflex action of the Golgi tendon organ, although it is not clear whether this occurs by changing the receptor or the neural pathways (

Gabriel et al., 2006

).



Metabolic Adaptations


In addition to greater strength and hypertrophy, metabolic adaptations occur within muscle fibers that increase the ability of the muscle to generate ATP. These changes are characterized by an increased ability to generate ATP from anaerobic metabolism; thus, there is an increase in phosphocreatine (PC) and glycogen stores and an increase in the enzyme creatine phosphokinase that breaks down PC (MacDougal et al., 1977
). Refer to Chapters 2
 and 3
 for a review of anaerobic metabolism.


Hormonal Adaptations


An acute bout of resistance exercise results in a catabolic state in which muscle proteins are broken down. During recovery, anabolism predominates, leading to muscle repair and growth. This coupled process of catabolism and anabolism is responsible for the remodeling of muscle tissue in response to resistance training. Many anabolic and catabolic processes are controlled by the neuroendocrine system, with numerous acute hormonal responses to resistance exercise. In contrast, resistance training causes relatively few hormonal adaptations.



Published reports are not consistent about the chronic effect of resistance training on resting testosterone levels. Several studies have reported elevated resting testosterone levels, whereas many others have reported no change in resting levels of testosterone following resistance training. Similarly, findings are inconsistent regarding the effect of resistance training on resting cortisol levels. It appears that the majority of resistance training programs do not change resting growth hormone concentration, but limited amounts of data from high volume–low repetition resistance training program studies show that these types of programs may cause a more dramatic growth hormone response. Evidence suggests, however, that resistance training leads to an increased resting level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (

Kraemer and Ratamess, 2005

;
 
Mangine et al., 2015

).





Male-Female Resistance Training Adaptation Comparisons




Although men are typically stronger than women, both sexes respond to resistance training in a similar manner (Bird et al., 2005
; Borde et al., 2015
; Cureton et al., 1988
; Ribeiro et al., 2014
; Tesch, 1992
). Typically, sedentary males and females can attain strength gains of 25–100% in a training program, although the actual increase in strength varies among muscle groups and is affected by the individual’s initial strength (Haskell et al., 2007
). Figure 19.7
 shows the percentage change in muscle strength for men and women for the elbow flexors, elbow extensors, knee flexors, and knee extensors after 16 weeks
 of participation in a weight training program (Cureton et al., 1988
). In addition to having similar patterns of strength gains, the men and women in this study both had similar changes in muscle cross-sectional area (as determined from CT scans). The cross-sectional area of the upper-arm muscles for the men and women increased 15 and 23%, respectively, after the 16-week training program. Although the men had a greater cross-sectional area than did the women, both before and after training, in both sexes, the muscle strength and muscle cross-sectional area of the upper arm increased with training.

A review article analyzing the results of studies in which groups of men and women followed the same training program also found that men and women respond to resistance training with similar increases in muscle cross-sectional area. This review found that on average, muscle cross-sectional area increases an average 0.13% per day in males and 0.14% per day in females (

Wernbom et al., 2007

). A more recent study comparing the increase in training load in men and women after a 16-week resistance training program suggested that both experience similar increases in strength and body mass in response to resistance training, but women actually experienced a more significant increase in training load (

Ribeiro et al., 2014

).





Resistance Training Adaptations in Children and Adolescents




Resistance training produces strength gains in prepubescents and adolescents and is recognized as an important component of youth fitness programs (Faigenbaum et al., 2009
, 2015
). Unfortunately, there is mounting evidence that children are less active than in previous generations. This lack of activity can result in muscular weakness and lack of power that undermine sports participation and increase the risk for injuries. Resistance training programs have been shown to be an effective means to increase strength and improve motor performance skills in children and adolescents (Faigenbaum et al., 2015
).



Research suggests that strength gains of approximately 30% (range 13–40%) are typical following short-term resistance training programs (up to 20 weeks) in children. Increases in strength seem fairly consistent between prepubescents and adolescents. There is no apparent difference in the relative strength (percentage) increases between boys and girls (

Faigenbaum et al., 2009

) nor between children/adolescents and adults (

Rowland, 2005

).




Although the strength improvement in children and adolescents is consistent with improvements documented in adults, the underlying physiological adaptations that account for increased strength appear somewhat different. Resistance training does not appear to induce muscle fiber hypertrophy in preadolescents, possibly because of the lack of testosterone. Studies investigating prepubertal children have shown increases in muscle size in both experimental and control groups, suggesting that hypertrophy experienced during the prepubertal stage of childhood and adolescence is attributable primarily to biological maturation (

Cunha et al., 2015

). Changes do occur in the ability of the nervous system to activate motor units, as shown by increased EMG activity with training. Improved motor coordination is also thought to be a contributing neural factor. Thus, neurological factors rather than muscular factors are believed to be responsible for the strength changes in this age group (

Faigenbaum et al., 2009

;
 
Rowland, 2005

).





Resistance Training Adaptations in Older Adults




Resistance exercise is widely acknowledged as beneficial for older adults, and many agencies actively promote resistance exercise for this age group (ACSM, 2009
; Nelson et al., 2007
). Resistance training is also safe and effective for increasing muscular strength and cross-sectional area in older individuals (Aagaard et al., 2007
; Charette et al., 1991
; Csapo and Alegre, 2016; Frontera et al., 1991
; Nelson et al., 2007
). Because of the ability of resistance training to increase muscle mass, strength, and function, it is recognized as an appropriate way to compensate for age-related decline in muscle mass (sarcopenia) and combat other degenerative age-related disorders (Ciolac and Rodrigues-da-Silva, 2016
; Power et al., 2013
; Watanabe et al., 2014
). In fact, older men and women have similar or even greater strength gains than young individuals from resistance training. Resistance training is a recommended component of fitness programs for older adults and is considered important for minimizing or reversing physical frailty, which is prevalent among the elderly (ACSM, 2009
; Kraemer and Ratamess, 2004
). Chronic resistance training over a long period results in greater strength, rate of force development, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area than is evidenced in untrained individuals
 (Aagaard et al., 2007
). Short-term resistance training programs are also successful in leading to muscular adaptations in the elderly. Figure 19.8
 shows the improvements in dynamic strength of the knee extensors (quadriceps) and the knee flexors (hamstrings) following 12 weeks of training in older men (Rogers and Evans, 1993
). By the end of the training period, strength in both muscle groups had increased over 100%. Additionally, these men demonstrated an 11% increase in muscle cross-sectional area, accompanied by a 34% increase in ST fiber area and a 28% increase in FT fiber area. Similar improvements have been reported in women. Bacelar et al. had sedentary women (aged 64 ± 3 years) perform 20 sessions of resistance training program over 10 weeks to examine the effects on the participants’ muscle strength and bone mineral density. They found a significant increase in 10-repetition maximal bench press and leg press and no significant negative changes in lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density. The results suggest that resistance training in elderly females is an effective method to increase muscle strength and maintain bone mineral density (Bacelar et al., 2015
). A recent meta-analysis investigating the dose-response relationships of resistance training in healthy older adults found that resistance training improved muscle strength substantially but had small effects on measures of muscle size. The study also found that the length of training period had the greatest effect on muscle strength (Borde et al., 2015
).

Resistance training is also beneficial for frail, institutionalized men and women (

Fiatarone et al., 1990

). A group of 90- to 100-year-old men and women who engaged in a resistance training program for 8 weeks increased their strength 174% (from an average initial value of 8–21 kg). Their muscle cross-sectional area increased 15%. These improvements demonstrate rather remarkably the capacity of the muscular system to adapt to progressive resistance exercise as long as a person is willing to participate in a program at an appropriate intensity.




Most studies that have investigated the effects of resistance training in older adults have relied on participants who were not obese. Recently, researchers extended these findings by investigating the effects of resistance training in obese individuals. This is particularly important as many individuals enter old age with excess adiposity and obesity may limit the ability to perform muscular work. The authors studied 126 older adults (age 65–79 years) who were overweight or obese and found that resistance training improved body composition, muscle strength, and physical function in obese elderly, but those with higher levels of initial adiposity experienced less improvement (

Nicklas et al., 2015

). These findings highlight the important interaction among systems (metabolic and neuromuscular) and reinforce the need to find ways to help individuals maintain a healthy weight.





Figure 19.9

 summarizes the results of several studies that investigated changes in muscle strength and cross-sectional area that occur in the quadriceps of males and

 females of various ages after a resistance training program. These values indicate a percentage change from the initial values; they do not imply that females are stronger than males as adults nor that the elderly are stronger than the younger subjects. In fact, those who are weakest initially may be in the best position to show a high percentage improvement.

Muscular Adaptations to Aerobic Endurance Training Programs




Muscle fibers respond differently to aerobic training than to resistance training. Aerobic training is characterized by increased aerobic power (

) with little or no change in muscle strength or power. Similarly, the structural and metabolic changes in muscle fibers facilitate the production of large quantities of ATP, primarily by aerobic means, following an aerobic training program, thus enhancing muscular endurance.



Aerobic endurance training results in an increase in ST fiber size in adult males and no change in FT fiber size (

Gollnick et al., 1972

). There is also evidence that aerobic endurance training can result in the transformation of FG muscle fibers to FOG muscle fibers (

Fleck and Kraemer, 1987

). Aerobic endurance training in older men and women also results in an increase in the cross-sectional area of the ST fibers (averaging 12%) and an increase in the percentage of FOG fibers (

Coggan et al., 1990

).





Muscular Adaptations to Concurrent Training




Many sports require a combination of muscular strength and aerobic endurance, and thus, a combination of resistance and aerobic endurance training is required to improve performance. The integration of endurance- and resistance-based training into a training program is called concurrent training
. The most consistent finding from studies of concurrent training is that increases in strength and power are lower than with strength training alone but changes in aerobic fitness are only slightly lower than those found with aerobic training alone. However, research findings are not consistent. Other studies have shown that concurrent training has no inhibitory effect on the development of strength or aerobic endurance. Finally, at least one study has shown that the development of aerobic fitness but not strength is compromised by concurrent training (Leveritt et al., 1999
; Nader, 2006
).





Concurrent Training
 The integration of endurance- and resistance-based training into a training program.





Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the more prevalent finding of inhibition of strength during concurrent training. If individuals do high-intensity training in both modalities, overtraining may be responsible. The chronic hypothesis contends that skeletal muscles cannot adapt to both types of training at the same time because many of the adaptations shown in
 
Table 19.3

 are different. The acute hypothesis contends that residual fatigue from the aerobic endurance component compromises the ability to work as hard as necessary during the resistance training. While both of these hypotheses are intuitively reasonable, only limited evidence exists for either one (

Leveritt et al., 1999

). Newer data highlight potential molecular mechanisms (

Hawley, 2009

). It is now clear that different modalities of exercise cause different intracellular signaling mechanisms; endurance training elicits increases in mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity of muscle fibers and resistance training initiates a cascade of events leading to increased synthesis of muscle contractile protein. The stimulation of the different pathways may result in inhibition or interference with the other pathway (

Hawley, 2009

;
 
Nader, 2006

).




Periodization programs that emphasize one or the other type of training throughout the training year rather than concurrent high-intensity training in both modalities may be very important for optimizing both muscular and aerobic endurance adaptations for athletes in sports requiring high levels of both. Training for fitness typically involves exercise sessions on different days for the different modalities, as opposed to true concurrent training. Also peak levels of performance are not generally the goal. Therefore, inhibition of one type of training by the other is not typically a major concern.





Neuromuscular Adaptations to Detraining




Detraining can be defined as a partial or complete loss of training-induced adaptations as a result of training reduction or cessation. Detraining may occur due to lack of compliance with a training program, injury or illness, or a planned periodization cycle especially in the transition (active rest) phase.



Detraining leads to loss of neuromuscular adaptations. As with the other systems, the time course for the loss of adaptation depends on the individual’s training status and the extent to which training load is decreased. Strength-trained athletes retain strength gains during short periods of inactivity (2 weeks) and retain significant portions of strength gains (88–93%) during inactivity lasting up to 12 weeks (

Mujika and Padilla, 2000

). Thus, it appears that strength gains are preserved longer than many other training adaptations.




The effect of detraining on muscle strength is not consistent in all muscle groups or for all exercises. In one study, squat exercise strength decreased by only 13% following 30–32 weeks of detraining, whereas leg press strength decreased by 32% (

Staron et al., 1991

). There appears to be no differences in strength loss between the sexes during detraining, but there is evidence that older

 individuals lose strength gains more rapidly than younger people (

Lemmer et al., 2000

). There is some evidence in trained swimmers that muscular power (defined as a swim test) may decrease substantially during 4 weeks of inactivity even when muscular strength is maintained (

Neufer et al., 1987

). On the other hand, vertical jump (a field measure of muscle power) has been shown to be unchanged with 8 or 12 weeks of detraining (

Häkkinen et al., 1981

,
 
1985

).




Short-term detraining (2 weeks) in resistance-trained athletes has resulted in a significant decrease in fast-twitch (FT) muscle fiber cross-sectional area, whereas longer periods of detraining (12 weeks) have been associated with a significant decrease in cross-sectional area of both FT and slow-twitch (ST) muscle fibers (

Häkkinen et al., 1985

;
 
Hortobágyi et al., 1993

). Diminished neural activation (as measured by integrated electromyography [IEMG]) has been shown to occur with detraining (

Häkkinen and Komi, 1983

;
 
Häkkinen et al., 1981

,
 
1985

).




The impact of detraining in children is confounded by the concomitant effects of growth-related strength increases. The actual gains above this growth level do appear to be lost once training ceases (

Blimkie, 1988

).





Special Application: Muscular Strength/Endurance and Health




Athletes have long used resistance training programs to increase muscular function and to improve performance. There is now increasing evidence for both children/adolescents and adults of all ages that enhanced neuromuscular fitness, especially muscular strength/endurance, is also associated with an improvement in overall health status and, conversely, a reduction of risk for chronic disease, disability, and, in adults and adolescents, mortality (Institute of Medicine, 2012
; Ortega et al., 2012
; Plowman, 2013
; Smith et al., 2014
; Warburton et al., 2006
).



Mortality rates have been found to be lower in adult males and females when individuals with moderate/high muscular fitness (primarily measured by grip strength, sit- ups, leg and bench press) were compared with individuals with low muscular fitness, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, and other potentially confounding variables (

FitzGerald et al., 2004

;
 
Katzmarzyk and Craig, 2002

). In one large-scale study, researchers assessed muscular fitness in over 9,100 men and women between the ages of 20 and 82 years over an 8-year period (

FitzGerald et al., 2004

). Muscular fitness was based on a composite score from a maximal bench press, maximal leg press, and the number of sit-ups completed in 1 minute. For each individual test, participants were divided into tertiles, and a combined score from the three tests was used as an indicator of muscular fitness—defined as low, medium, or high. A mortality follow-up was conducted 7 years after the completion of the muscular fitness evaluation, revealing that 194 participants had died since their evaluation. A statistical analysis was performed comparing the relative risk of all-cause mortality across all three groups in which the relative risk was set at 1.0 for the low muscular fitness group. Participants in the moderate and high muscular fitness groups had a relative risk of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.44–0.93) and 0.80 (95% CI = 0.49–1.31) compared with the low muscular fitness group after statistically adjusting for differences in age, health status, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and cardiorespiratory fitness. In a related study, high muscular strength in male adolescents (females were not studied as the participants were Swedish military conscripts), as assessed by knee extension and handgrip tests, was associated with a 20–25% lower risk of premature mortality due to any cause or cardiovascular disease (

Ortega et al., 2012

). More details about this important study can be found in the accompanying Focus on Research box.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Relationship between Muscular Strength and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality






Understanding which factors contribute to premature mortality, defined as death before the age of 55 years, may help early treatment of disease or even prevent disease from developing. For example, as described in Chapter 15
, there are several risk factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including cigarette smoking, high cholesterol fractions, and physical inactivity. By decreasing the number of CVD risk factors an individual possesses, his or her likelihood of death from CVD is diminished. You are likely aware that research has found that obesity, hypertension, and low cardiorespiratory fitness are powerful predictors of premature mortality due to CVD. The influence of muscular strength on cardiovascular disease mortality, however, is less obvious and less well studied. However, one large-scale study provides compelling data.







In this study, the authors examined the influence that muscular strength during adolescence has on all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD (coronary heart disease and stroke). Just over 1 million 16- to 19-year-old adolescent males were included in the study. Baseline measures of muscle strength (knee extension and handgrip strength), body mass index (BMI), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) were recorded. Participants were followed until death, date of emigration, or the end of the follow-up period, whichever came first. The median follow-up period was 24.2 years.








Approximately 2.3% of the participants died throughout the follow-up period, 7.8% of which were due to CVD (coronary heart disease or stroke). Suicide, cancer, nonintentional accidents, and other causes of mortality accounted for the remainder of deaths during follow-up.








For analysis, participants were divided into tenths to assess how incremental increases in muscular strength influenced the likelihood of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. Compared with the weakest group (first tenth), greater muscular strength in the second, third, and fourth tenth groups resulted in a reduction in all-cause mortality (not shown). Mortality risk plateaued around a 20% reduction from the fourth tenth to the last tenth (strongest). Muscular strength alone was not associated with premature cardiovascular mortality; however, when adjusted for BMI and DBP, high muscular strength groups reduced their risk of cardiovascular mortality by 35% (see accompanying figure).








These findings suggest that low muscular strength during adolescence may be a valid predictor of premature death from all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, suggesting that interventions target those with strength levels lower than the population average. Greater levels of muscular strength do not appear to provide additional protection. Furthermore, the study indicates that risk of premature death is a complex issue, affected by multiple body systems (muscular, metabolic, and cardiovascular) working in concert.

Muscular fitness has also been shown to have a positive influence on cardiovascular risk factors (

Magnussen, Schmidt, Dwyer and Venn, 2012

;
 
Ortega et al., 2008

; Smith et al., 2014;
 
Warburton et al., 2001a

). Specifically, resistance training has been shown to lower LDL-C, raise HDL-C, and reduce both SBP and DBP (

Phillips and Winett, 2010

;
 
Strasser et al., 2010

).




Several lines of research indicate the positive effects of resistance training on metabolic health. Substantial improvements in blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (an index of glucose control), insulin sensitivity, and insulin stabilization have been reported in individuals with diabetes who have weight trained (

Phillips and Winett, 2010

;
 
Strasser et al., 2010

). Evidence is also emerging that indicates a positive impact of neuromuscular fitness on metabolic syndrome/metabolic health risk factors in both adults (

Churilla et al., 2012

;
 
Strasser et al., 2010

) and youths (

Artero et al., 2011

;
 
Benson et al., 2008

; Smith et al., 2013;
 
Steene-Johannessen et al., 2009

). This relationship appears to operate independently of, or in addition to, cardiorespiratory fitness and/or body mass/body composition. A large, multicenter European study examined the independent associations of muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in over 700 adolescents (aged 12.7–17.5) (

Artero et al., 2011

). In this study, adolescents in the lowest muscular fitness quartile (based on handgrip score) had a significantly elevated metabolic risk compared to all other fitness quartiles. Additional analysis revealed that the participants who were in the lowest quartile for muscular fitness and the lowest quartile for cardiorespiratory fitness had a significantly higher metabolic risk score than all other groups.




High levels of muscular strength and muscular endurance and/or resistance training improvements have also been shown to positively impact or predict long-term changes in body composition (

Institute of Medicine, 2012

;
 
Smith et al., 2014

;
 
Strasser et al., 2010

;
 
Warburton et al., 2001b

,
 
2006

). In general, resistance training programs are associated with a decrease in fat mass and visceral adipose tissue (a component of the metabolic syndrome). Because resistance training decreases fat mass and increases lean mass, it results in positive health benefits even in the absence of overall changes in body weight

.




The evidence for a positive association between muscular fitness and bone health is strong in children and adolescents (

Smith et al., 2014

). The optimal prevention strategy for maintenance of bone health in adults is the attainment of a strong, dense skeleton during the growth years. Despite a large genetic contribution to bone mass, resistance and high-impact exercise can contribute an additional 5–15% to bone formation (

Boreham and Riddoch, 2001

;
 
Faigenbaum et al., 2009

).




In addition to the evidence of a role of resistance training in improving cardiometabolic health and body composition, there is also extensive literature indicating that muscular fitness is an important determinant of quality of life, including measures of functional status and psychological well-being.




Because of the numerous benefits of muscular fitness, many organizations are promoting resistance training as a part of every complete fitness program.

 In fact, as described in the preceding paragraphs, there are many well-documented health benefits of resistance training programs, some of which are summarized in
 
Table 19.4

.

Special Application: Muscular Strength and Endurance and Low-Back Health




To have a healthy, well-functioning back, an individual must have flexible low-back (lumbar) muscles, hamstrings, and hip flexors and strong, fatigue-resistant abdominal and back extensor muscles. The goal is to keep the vertebrae aligned properly without excessive disk pressure, allowing a full range of motion in all directions. In addition, the pelvis must freely rotate both posteriorly and anteriorly without straining the muscle or fascia (Table 19.5
).



TABLE 19.5
 Theoretical Relationship between Physical Fitness Components and Healthy or Unhealthy Low-Back or Spinal Function







Unfortunately, as illustrated in Figure 19.10 at some point in their lives, 60–80% of all people experience low-back pain (LBP). The condition is disabling in 1–5% of the population. Most cases of LBP occur between the ages of

 25 and 60 years, but 12–26% of children and adolescents are LBP sufferers. Males and females are affected equally.










Figure 19.10.
 Approximately 60-80% of the population experience low-back pain (LBP) at some point.





The exact causes and risk factors for LBP have not been identified. However, there has been great interest in the link between muscular fitness and the absence or occurrence of LBP. Some tests of health-related physical fitness have included sit-and-reach, sit-ups or curl-ups, and trunk extension tests as means of testing low-back function. The theoretical link between physical fitness and LBP is largely based on functional anatomy, and at this time, the anatomical logic is stronger than the research evidence.




Research evidence shows that individuals suffering from LBP have less strength in both abdominal and back extensors. EMG fatigue indices are also increased in the back muscles of individuals with LBP. These differences, however, are more likely to be the result of LBP rather than the cause. Studies that have attempted to predict who might get LBP, either for a first time or in recurrent episodes, based on strength and muscular endurance measures have identified back extension endurance as the critical variable. That is, individuals with low levels of back extension endurance are more likely to develop LBP than individuals with high levels of back extensor endurance (

Steele et al., 2014

). Although high levels of back extensor strength and abdominal flexion strength or endurance have not been shown to have this same predictive value, they have never been shown to be detrimental. Thus, a total body workout for strength and muscular endurance should include exercises for the back and abdominals, even though such a program does not absolutely protect individuals from LBP (

Plowman, 1992

;
 
Plowman, 2013

).

 Clinically Relevant





Low-Back Strengthening






This review article examines the effect of specific resistance training for back extension (lumbar extension) in the treatment of chronic low-back pain (CLBP). As Carpenter and Nelson point out, there is a great need for exercise leaders to understand the appropriate use of exercise to prevent and treat low-back pain, because low-back pain is the fifth most frequent reason for hospitalization and third most frequent reason for surgical procedures. Acute low-back pain (pain lasting <3 weeks) usually resolves itself without any intervention; by 3 weeks, 75% of individuals have recovered from acute low-back pain, and by 2 months, 90% of individuals have recovered from low-back pain. However, patients with CLBP (symptoms lasting more than 7 weeks) do not enjoy the same prognosis. In fact, CLBP is the number one cause of disability in the United States. Furthermore, the longer an individual suffers from CLBP, the worse the prognosis. Patients with CLBP are characterized by the deconditioning syndrome: a cyclical pattern of pain, followed by avoidance of activity, followed by deconditioning, which leads to more pain. Therefore, the general consensus is that patients with CLBP need active reconditioning exercises that progressively apply overload to strengthen the back (lumbar) extensors. Research data reviewed by Carpenter and Nelson support the following exercise prescription for individuals who suffer from CLBP:





1.
 Specific exercise—Resistance exercise of lumbar extensors with the pelvis stabilized




2.
 Overload—1 set of 8–15 repetitions to fatigue




3.
 Frequency—1 d·wk
−1






A rehabilitation program using an exercise program similar to this for patients who had suffered CLBP for an average of 26 months resulted in improved lumbar strength and range of motion and substantial improvements in low-back pain and leg pain. Furthermore, the patients who demonstrated the greatest gains in muscle strength also experienced the greatest decrease in pain. Exercise programs that apply progressive overload to strengthen the lumbar extensors have also been shown to prevent low-back pain. The graph summarizes the results of a study that examined the incidence of back injuries in a group of strip mine workers who participated in a program of isolated low-back muscle strengthening. Data are also presented for the industry average and the average incidence of low-back injury in this coal mine for the past 9 years.








This review article clearly shows that a progressive resistance training program aimed at strengthening the lumbar extensors can significantly help prevent and treat low-back pain. Given the extremely high incidence of low-back pain, all exercise professionals should understand the potential beneficial effect of exercise. This information applies not only to individuals working in occupational settings but also to anyone who routinely recommends exercise to individuals—that is, to all exercise professionals.

SUMMARY





1.
 Resistance training is used to improve overall health, improve athletic performance, rehabilitate injuries, and change physical appearance. Resistance training is also the primary activity in the sports of power lifting and bodybuilding.




2.
 A plan for muscular fitness should be specific to the individual’s goals, which may include the development of muscular strength, hypertrophy, power or endurance, or any combination of these properties

.




3.
 Overload of the muscular system is achieved by manipulating the load, volume, rest intervals, and frequency of training. Volume is determined by load (intensity) and repetitions (volume = load × reps × sets).




4.
 If different individuals use the same training program, adaptation will occur at different rates because of individual differences in age, body size and type, initial strength, and genetic makeup.




5.
 A coach or exercise leader must be sensitive to the differences in rates of individual adaptation, which directly affect the progression of training. A common mistake is for coaches to design a program for the entire team and expect adaptations to occur at the same rate.




6.
 Adaptation to resistance training in children and older adults is very similar to adaptations that occur in young and middle-aged adults.




7.
 Periodization within a training program can help prevent the inhibitions of strength gains during concurrent training.




8.
 Strength gains are preserved for longer periods of time compared to other training adaptations. The impact of detraining on muscle strength varies by muscle group and exercise type.




9.
 Resistance training provides multiple health benefits, including decreased mortality, improved cardiometabolic health, and improved functional measures.




10.
 Functional back health requires flexibility in the lumbar muscles, hamstrings, and hip flexors and strength of the abdominals and back extensor muscles.





Review Questions





1.
 Give several reasons why an individual may engage in a resistance training program and specify different goals of such programs.




2.
 Discuss how each of the training principles can be applied in the development of a resistance training program. How do these applications vary if the exerciser is a child?




3.
 Is there an ideal number of repetitions and sets that should be performed by everyone? Defend your answer.




4.
 Discuss the importance of adequate recovery time for training adaptations to a resistance training program.




5.
 Do all individuals respond to a training program with the same adaptation (or magnitude of adaptation)? Why or why not?




6.
 What is the importance of a warm-up period before resistance training?




7.
 Compare and contrast the training adaptations that occur in skeletal muscle as a result of resistance training and endurance training.




8.
 Describe the health benefits of muscular strength and endurance training.




9.
 What is the relationship between muscle function and low-back health?




10.
 Identify three research questions about resistance training for which scientists have yet to provide answers.
