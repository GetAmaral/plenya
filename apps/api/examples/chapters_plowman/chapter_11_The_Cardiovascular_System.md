Introduction




Chapter 9 described how oxygen is taken into the body for delivery to body cells. The ability to deliver oxygen (and other substances) depends on the proper functioning of the cardiovascular system. In many ways, the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system operate together to accomplish a common mission—to deliver oxygen to working muscles—and they are driven by similar mechanisms. This chapter provides an overview of the cardiovascular system, discusses basic principles of cardiovascular dynamics, and outlines techniques typically used to assess cardiovascular function at rest, during, and following exercise.




Overview of the Cardiovascular System




The cardiovascular system
 includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Its primary functions are:



1.
 To transport oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body and to transport carbon dioxide and waste products from the cells




2.
 To regulate body temperature, pH levels, and fluid balance




3.
 To protect the body from blood loss and infection




The heart is a double pump that provides the force to circulate the blood throughout the vessels of the circulatory system. The blood vessels serve as sophisticated, dynamic conduits for the blood as it is distributed through the body. The blood is the medium that transports gases and nutrients within the cardiovascular system.





Figure 11.1

 is a schematic overview of the cardiovascular system.
 Arteries
 carry blood away from the heart, and
 veins
 return blood to the heart. The
 capillary beds
 serve as the site of exchange for gases and nutrients between the blood and body tissues. Blood is ejected from the ventricles on both sides of the heart simultaneously. The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it is oxygenated and then returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins; this is called the
 pulmonary circulation
. The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood through the aorta, which then branches extensively into arteries to carry the blood to body cells through numerous specific circulations. The partially deoxygenated blood returns to the right atrium. Collectively, this route from the left ventricle to the right atrium is known as the
 systemic circulation
.










FIGURE 11.1
 Schematic Overview of the Cardiovascular System and Interaction with the Respiratory System.





As described in the respiration chapters,
 external respiration
 is the exchange of gases (O
2
, CO
2
) between the lungs and blood.
 Internal respiration
 is the exchange of gases (O
2
, CO
2
) at the cellular level. The cardiovascular system functions primarily to move the gases (as well as nutrients from the digestive tract to the tissues) between these two exchange sites so that energy can be produced by cellular respiration.
 Cellular respiration
 is described completely in the metabolic unit.



The Heart


The heart is a hollow muscular organ located in the thoracic cavity. It weighs approximately 250–350 g and is 12–14 cm long, about the size of a clenched fist. The heart beats approximately 70 times per minute in a resting adult—or over 100,000 times per day!


Macroanatomy of the Heart


The heart has four chambers and is functionally separated into the right and left heart. The right side pumps blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation), and the left side pumps blood to the entire body (systemic circulation). Heart muscle is called myocardium
. The two sides of the heart are separated by the interventricular septum. The upper chambers, called atria
 (atrium
 is the singular), receive the blood into the heart. The lower chambers, called ventricles
, eject blood from the heart (Figure 11.2A
). Blood is ejected from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and from the left ventricle to the aorta.

Myocardium
 The heart muscle.



Myocytes
 The contractile cells of the heart (cardiac muscle cells).



Intercalated Discs
 The junction between adjacent cardiac muscle cells that forms a mechanical and electrical connection between cells.



Syncytium
 A group of cells of the myocardium that function collectively as a unit.





One-way valves control blood flow through the heart. The
 atrioventricular (AV) valves
 separate the atrium and ventricle on each side of the heart. Specifically, the tricuspid valve separates the atrium and ventricle on the right side of the heart, and the bicuspid (or mitral) valve separates the atrium and ventricle on the left side of the heart. The
 semilunar valves
 control blood flow from the ventricles. Specifically, the aortic semilunar valve allows blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta, and the pulmonary semilunar valve allows blood to flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery.




Connective tissue plays a critical role in providing structure to the heart, anchoring it to surrounding structures, and preventing overfilling. The heart is enclosed by a double-walled sac of connective tissue called the pericardium that is filled with pericardial fluid. The epicardium is the inner layer of the double-walled layer and is the layer of connective tissue that directly covers the myocardium. The endocardium is a single layer of endothelium (connective tissue) that lines the cavities of the heart. The heart contains a dense network of connective tissue fibers, including collagen and elastic fibers, that form a fibrous skeleton of the heart and reinforces the myocardial structure and provides an anchor for cardiac muscle cells.
 
Figure 11.2A

 shows the major structures of the heart and the flow of blood.

Microanatomy of the Heart


Cardiac muscle cells, called myocytes
, are the contractile cells that produce the force that ejects blood from the ventricles. Cardiac muscle cells are both similar to and
 different from skeletal muscle cells. Both are striated in appearance because they contain the contractile proteins actin and myosin. The primary difference between cardiac and skeletal muscle cells is that cardiac muscle cells are highly interconnected, that is, the cell membranes of adjacent cardiac cells are structurally and functionally linked by intercalated discs
 (Figure 11.3
). The intercalated discs contain specialized intracellular junctions (gap junctions) that allow the electrical activity in one myocyte to pass to adjacent myocytes. Thus, the individual cells of the myocardium function collectively: when one cell is stimulated electrically, the stimulation spreads from cell to cell over the entire area. This electrical coupling allows the myocardium to function as a single coordinated unit or a functional syncytium
. Each of the two functional syncytia, the atrial and ventricular, contracts as a unit.









FIGURE 11.3
 Cardiac Myocyte.




The Heart as Excitable Tissu
e


Cardiac muscle cells are excitable cells that are polarized (have an electrical charge with the inside being negative relative to the outside of the cell) in the resting state and contract when they become depolarized (the charges reverse). Repolarization (the electrical charge returns to resting value) results in relaxation of the myocytes. With each contraction, blood is ejected from the chambers. Individual myocardial cells function together to produce a coordinated contraction of the entire syncytium. Generally, when contraction of the heart is referred to, unless specified otherwise, it means contraction of the ventricles.



In addition to contractile muscle cells, the heart contains specialized conducting cells (

Figure 11.4A

). Although there are far fewer conducting cells than contractile muscle cells, they are essential because they spread the electrical signal quickly throughout the myocardium. The conduction system cells with the fastest spontaneous rate of depolarization are called the
 pacemaker
 cells. These are located in the
 sinoatrial (SA) node
 in the right atria. As shown in
 
Figure 11.4A

, the excitation spreads from the SA node throughout the right atria by internodal tracts and to the left atria by
 Bachmann’s bundle.
 Because the atrial and ventricular syncytia contract separately, excitation in the atria does not lead directly to the contraction of cardiac cells in the ventricles. The electrical signal is spread from the atria to the ventricles via the
 atrioventricular (AV) node
. Once the AV node is depolarized, the electrical signal continues down the specialized conduction system consisting of the
 bundle of His
, the
 left and right bundle branches
, and the
 Purkinje fibers
. The electrical excitation then spreads out from the conducting system to excite all of the cardiac muscle cells in the ventricles. Thus, the excitation is spread first by the conduction system and then by cell-to-cell contact: The excitation must be passed from muscle cell to muscle cell within the ventricles since the conduction system does not reach each individual myocyte.










FIGURE 11.4
 Conduction System of the Heart.

 Conduction pathway of the heart. B.
 ECG tracing that is color coded to show movement of the electrical signal through the conduction system and then through the heart.





As mentioned earlier, the cells of the SA node are considered the pacemaker cells of the heart because they normally have the fastest rate of depolarization. Cells in each area of the conduction system have their own inherent rates of depolarization. For the SA node, the intrinsic rate of depolarization is 60–100 times·min
−1
. The AV node discharges at an intrinsic rate of 40–60 times·min
−1
, and the Purkinje fibers at a rate of 15–40 times·min
−1
 (

Hall, 2016

). If the SA node is diseased, the AV node may take over the pacemaking. While it is generally known that endurance training leads to a lower resting heart rate, if the only thing you knew about an individual was that he or she had a resting heart rate of 40 b·min
−1
, you could not tell whether the person was a highly trained endurance athlete or someone in need of an artificial pacemaker implant because the SA node was not functioning properly.



Electrocardiogram


An electrocardiogram (ECG)
 provides a graphic illustration of the electrical current generated by excitation of the heart muscle. Figure 11.4B
 presents an ECG tracing
 that is color coded to match the movement of the electrical current though the conduction system in Figure 11.4A
. The spread of the electrical signal through the conduction system of the atria is shown in green. The P wave represents atrial depolarization, which causes atrial contraction. Repolarization of the atria, which results in a Ta wave, is normally not detectable on a resting ECG, but occurs during the time period concurrent with the QRS complex and may be evident during exercise. The electrical signal reaches the AV node at the end of the P wave (shown in yellow
). Excitation of the bundle of His and bundle branches (shown in red
) occurs in the middle of the PR interval, followed by excitation of the Purkinje fibers (shown in purple
). Note that excitation of the various portions of the conduction system happens very quickly and that activation of the entire conduction system precedes the QRS complex. The QRS complex reflects depolarization of the myocytes in the ventricles. It occurs after the electrical signal has traveled through the specialized conduction system in the ventricles and is occurring simultaneously with atrial repolarization. The T wave reflects repolarization of the muscle cells in the ventricles and is followed by relaxation in preparation to start the cycle all over again. The U wave may or may not be seen in a normal ECG but is often present in the slower cardiac cycle of trained individuals. When present, it probably represents the final phase of ventricular repolarization during which the Purkinje system recovers.



Although the SA node can depolarize spontaneously, the firing of the SA node is influenced by neural and hormonal factors (discussed later in the chapter). Additionally, heart rate varies with age.
 
Table 11.1

 presents typical resting heart rate (HR) values in healthy individuals of various ages. While the resting heart rate values may not seem impressive when reported on a per minute basis, it is remarkable to consider how many times the heart beats per hour, or per day. Other factors that affect heart rate are discussed later in this chapter.

Cardiac Cycle


To function successfully as a pump, the heart must have alternating times of relaxation and contraction. The relaxation phase, called diastole
, is the period when the heart fills with blood. The contraction phase, called systole
, is the period when blood is ejected from the heart. The cardiac cycle
—one complete sequence of contraction and relaxation of the heart—includes all events associated with the flow of blood through the heart. During the cardiac cycle, there are dramatic changes in pressure and blood volume. Figure 11.5
 summarizes the flow of blood in the heart and the position of the heart valves throughout the periods of the cardiac cycle. A key to understanding the periods of the heart is the fact that valves control the flow of blood through the heart. If the AV valves are closed, blood volume in the ventricles cannot increase; if the semilunar valves are closed, then blood cannot be ejected and volume does not decrease. Furthermore, it is pressure differences that control the valves. When pressure is greater in the ventricle than the aorta, it forces the one-way valve to open.

Cardiac Cycle

The
 ventricular-filling period (VFP)
 (

Figure 11.5A

) occurs when the ventricles are at rest (ventricular diastole) and the AV valves are open. The ventricles fill as blood is returned to the atria and flows down into the ventricles. Blood flow into the ventricles from the atria is assisted by gravity in an upright person. Atrial contraction also pushes a small volume of additional blood into

 the ventricles at the end of diastole. Blood volume in the ventricles is greatest at the end of ventricular filling, but pressure remains relatively low because the ventricles are relaxed.




Systole (the contraction phase, shown on the right side of the figure) is divided into two periods, the
 isovolumetric contraction period (ICP)
 and the
 ventricular ejection period (VEP).
 During the ICP (

Figure 11.5B

), both the AV valves and the semilunar valves are closed. Thus, for this very brief period, blood volume in the ventricles remains constant (
isovolumetric
) despite the high pressure generated by the contraction of the ventricular myocardium. Once the pressure in the ventricles exceeds the pressure in the aorta, the semilunar valves are forced open and blood is ejected from the ventricles, initiating the VEP. During VEP, ventricular volume decreases as blood is ejected from the ventricles through the open semilunar valves (

Figure 11.5C

).






FOCUS ON APPLICATION
 Clinically Relevant





Are All Elevations in Heart Rate Equal?






Heart rate (HR) can be elevated by a variety of factors mediated by the neural and hormonal systems (see Figures 11.16
 and 11.17
). One of these factors is movement (exercise), but others include emotion and environmental temperatures. Does an individual derive the same benefit from HR elevation caused by emotion or heat as from HR elevation caused by exercise? That is, is it possible to improve one’s cardiovascular function while sitting in a sauna or hot tub or when frightened, angry, or anxious?







A regular, sustained elevation in HR is recognized as an important factor for improving cardiovascular fitness (techniques of exercise prescription based on HR are described in
 
Chapter 13

). However, the exercise HR responses are primarily an indicator of the training stimulus to the body—the increase in energy expenditure or metabolism (oxygen consumption). Heart rate and oxygen consumption rise in a directly proportional fashion during exercise. When emotion or temperature causes an elevation in HR, however, minimal change occurs in energy expenditure; hence, there is no training stimulus.








The importance of an increase in oxygen consumption has been demonstrated by individuals on medications such as beta-blockers, which markedly suppress HR at rest and during exercise, and by those with constant heart-rate pacemakers. Both of these groups routinely show improvements in exercise capacity and fitness as a result of exercise programs, despite the fact that the exercise-induced increase in HR is dampened. Although HR can be elevated by other factors, you do not derive the health-related benefits unless the elevated HR is accompanied by physical activity.

During the
 isovolumetric relaxation period (IRP),
 both the AV and the semilunar valves are closed (

Figure 11.5D

). Thus, ventricular volume is again unchanged (isovolumetric), but pressure is low because the ventricles are relaxed.




All these events occur within a single cardiac cycle, which repeats with every beat of the heart.
 
Figure 11.6

 summarizes the cardiac cycle graphically, showing concurrent information about the electrocardiogram; the pressure in the left atrium, the left ventricle, and aorta;

 the left ventricular volume; the heart phase; the period of the cardiac cycle; and the position of the heart valves. As in
 
Figure 11.5

, diastole is shown in blue, and systole is shown in green. The position of the AV and semilunar valves is shown in
 
Figures 11.5

 and
 
11.6

.










FIGURE 11.6
 Graphic Summary of the Cardiac Cycle.
 The periods of the cardiac cycle are labeled as 1, VFP; 2, ICP; 3, VEP; and 4, IRP.






Figure 11.6

 begins arbitrarily during the VFP of ventricular diastole (also shown in
 
Figure 11.5A

). The AV valves are open, allowing blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles; therefore, ventricular volume is increasing. As the atria contract, more blood is forced into the ventricles, causing a small increase in ventricular volume and ventricular pressure.




Following the QRS complex, there is an immediate and dramatic increase in ventricular pressure as the myocardium contracts. Note, however, that the ventricular volume does not immediately change. This is the ICP. Locate Point A on the graph of ventricular pressure in
 
Figure 11.6

—this is the point where pressure in the ventricle exceeds pressure in the aorta, and the aortic semilunar valve is forced open. Follow the dashed line downward to the row for the semilunar valves in the chart at the bottom of the figure, and note that these valves are now opened. Also note that this dashed line coincides with the start of a rapid decrease in ventricular volume. Once the valves are open, blood is forced out of the ventricles; thus, blood volume in the ventricles decreases. This is the VEP.




When pressure in the ventricles falls below pressure in the aorta, the semilunar valves close. Refer to Point B on the pressure curve of
 
Figure 11.6

 and again follow the dashed line downward, noting ventricular volume and valve position. Ventricular pressure is decreasing because the myocardium is relaxed (in diastole). Ventricular volume, however, remains constant, because all the valves are closed and no blood can enter or leave the ventricles. This is known as the IRP.




Following the T wave (ventricular repolarization), the ventricles relax and begin to fill with blood: The AV valves are open, and ventricular volume increases. This is the VFP. This cycle of diastole followed by systole followed by diastole continues with each beat of the heart.




Diastole provides time for the cardiac cells to relax and the ventricles to fill. The length of time spent in diastole thereby directly affects the amount of blood that will be present in the ventricles to be pumped during the subsequent systole. Furthermore, it is during diastole that the myocardium is supplied with blood.




Systole is the contraction period of the heart, first isometrically (ICP) and then dynamically (VEP). The volume of blood ejected from the ventricles directly affects the

 cardiovascular system’s ability to meet the demands of the body. The volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole is termed
 end-diastolic volume (EDV)
 and is labeled in
 
Figure 11.6

. Similarly, the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of systole is termed
 end-systolic volume (ESV)
. The amount of blood ejected from the ventricles with each beat is called
 stroke volume (SV)
, which is equal to EDV – ESV.
 
Figure 11.6

 depicts the volume in the left ventricle (LV), but because both sides of the heart must pump the same amount of blood over any significant period of time, the SV is typically the same for both sides of the heart.

 Heart rate (HR)
 is thus defined as the number of cardiac cycles per minute, expressed as beats per minute (b·min
−1
).

Stroke Volume


As mentioned previously, stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood ejected from the ventricles with each beat, expressed as milliliters per beat (mL·b−1
) or simply in milliliters (mL). The amount of blood ejected from the heart is determined by three primary factors:



1.
 Preload—the volume of blood returned to the heart




2.
 Contractility—the force of myocardial contraction




3.
 Afterload—the resistance presented to the contracting ventricle




The volume of blood returned to the heart is called
 preload
 and is critical to the stroke volume because the heart cannot eject blood that is not there. Under resting conditions, the heart ejects approximately 50–60% of the blood that is returned; this is known as the
 ejection fraction (EF)
.
 
Figure 11.7

 depicts changes in the volume of blood in the ventricles throughout the cardiac cycle and defines specific volumes associated with the ventricles. In this figure, the EDV is approximately 130 mL of blood, which is typical for an adult male under resting conditions. Following systole, the ESV is approximately 60 mL of blood. Stroke volume can then be calculated as

Thus, 70 mL of blood was ejected from each ventricle during this contraction of the heart.




The ejection fraction (EF) can now be calculated from the information as follows:



11.2 







Example






Calculate the ejection fraction for the previous example.











Note in
 
Figure 11.7

 that the SV can increase by either an increased EDV (which encroaches into diastolic reserve volume) or a decreased ESV (which encroaches into systolic reserve volume) or a combination of the two. However, the entire blood volume cannot be ejected; thus, there is always a residual volume of blood in the heart (

Brechar and Galletti, 1963

). Because the subdivisions of ventricular volume parallel those of the lungs, it may be helpful to refer back to
 
Figure 9.6

 to fully understand this principle.




Under normal conditions, as the volume of blood returned to the heart (EDV) increases, SV increases. This relationship is known as the Frank-Starling law of the heart (

Figure 11.8

). Increasing EDV, to a point, increases stroke volume because the increased volume of blood in the ventricles provides a preload that stretches the myocardium and enhances the force of contraction by optimizing the overlap of actin and myosin filaments (

Levick, 2003

).










FIGURE 11.8
 Frank-Starling Law of the Heart.





Contractility
, the force of contraction of the myocardium, is determined primarily by neural innervation. Sympathetic nervous stimulation causes an increase in the contractility of the myocardium independent of the volume of blood returned to the heart. Circulating catecholamines (hormones) also reinforce the increased contractility caused by sympathetic nerve stimulation. During exercise, the Frank-Starling mechanism

 (increases in preload) and increased contractility (due to sympathetic nervous stimulation) function together to enhance stroke volume.
 
Figure 11.8

 (upper curve) shows how sympathetic nervous stimulation can increase stroke volume at any given EDV. Answer the

3.
 Check your answer in Appendix C.






The
 afterload
, or the resistance presented to the contracting ventricle, is determined primarily by the blood pressure in the aorta. As blood pressure increases, opposition to the outward flow of blood increases, and less blood is ejected from the ventricles for any given force of contraction—that is, stroke volume decreases as afterload increases. The stroke volume decreases in this way because the increased pressure in the aorta causes the semilunar valves to remain closed longer and to close sooner. The valve is thus open for less time, thereby causing a decrease in ejection time and a subsequent decrease in stroke volume.
 
Table 11.1

 presents typical values for stroke volume at rest in healthy individuals of various ages.



Cardiac Output



Cardiac output
 (

) is the amount of blood pumped per unit of time, normally reported in liters per minute. It represents the total blood flow through the entire cardiovascular system and reflects the body’s ability to meet changing metabolic needs during rest and exercise. Cardiac output is calculated as


11.3 




At rest, cardiac output for an adult male is approximately 5 L·min
−1
. It is interesting to note that resting blood volume, in average-sized adult males, is also approximately 5 L. Thus, at rest, the entire volume of blood is circulated through the body each minute.
 
Table 11.1

Example

 and an SV of 100 mL of blood.











Because
 

 is usually reported in liters, this value is divided by 1,000 and is reported as 6.4 L·min
−1
. Note that although SV is usually expressed in milliliters (mL), it is actually measured in milliliters per beat (mL·b
−1
) since by definition SV must be per beat

Coronary Circulation


The energy necessary for cardiac function is supplied through aerobic metabolism. Arterial coronary circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the myocardium through two major arteries, the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery (Figure 11.9
). Both arteries originate at the root of the aorta. The left coronary artery divides into the left circumflex and anterior descending arteries. The right coronary artery divides into the marginal artery and the posterior interventricular artery. The myocardium is supplied with a dense distribution of arterioles and capillaries, approximately 3,000–4,000 capillaries per square millimeter of cardiac muscle (Rowell, 1986
). The venous blood from the coronary circulation is returned to the right atrium via the coronary sinus.









FIGURE 11.9
 Coronary Circulation.





Coronary blood flow is affected greatly by the phase of the cardiac cycle. Because of the high intramyocardial pressure during systole, the coronary arteries are compressed, and blood flow to the myocardium is decreased. Thus, the myocardium receives the largest portion of its blood flow during diastole (

Hall, 2016

). The myocardial blood flow required to provide necessary oxygen at rest is about 250 mL·min
−1
, which represents approximately 4% of the normal resting cardiac output (

Rowell, 1986

). The coronary circulation very effectively extracts oxygen as the blood flows through the capillary beds. Under resting conditions, 60–70% of the available oxygen is extracted.



Myocardial Oxygen Consumption


Because the metabolic demands of the myocardium are increased during exercise, myocardial oxygen consumption—
the amount of
 oxygen used by the heart muscle to produce energy for contraction—increases during exercise. Myocardial oxygen consumption reflects the work of the heart and is determined by oxygen extraction (a-vO
2
diff)
 and blood flow (


)
. As mentioned previously, oxygen extraction of the coronary circulation is nearly optimal at rest (60–70%) and increases little if at all during exercise. Thus, the increased myocardial oxygen consumption during exercise occurs almost entirely by increased blood flow (

) to the myocardium
.



The coronary blood flow must be regulated to meet the demands of the myocardium for oxygen. In addition to a higher heart rate, blood flow is increased by two mechanisms:




1.
 The greater force of myocardial contraction that results from exercise causes more blood to be forced into the coronary circulation.




2.
 By-products of cellular work cause vasodilation of the arterioles that supply the myocardium. Thus, as the heart works harder and produces more by-products, the arterioles dilate, which decreases resistance and effectively increases blood flow.




Myocardial oxygen consumption increases as heart rate increases. Because heart rate increases with the intensity of exercise, so also does myocardial oxygen consumption (

Kitamura et al., 1972

). Thus, oxygen consumption also increases as myocardial contractility increases. Myocardial oxygen consumption can be estimated from the
 rate-pressure product (RPP)
, which is the product of heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP):



11.4 




RPP provides a good estimate of myocardial oxygen consumption under a wide range of conditions, including dynamic and static exercise. RPP is a commonly used clinical measure, especially in cardiac rehabilitation, because it provides an estimate of myocardial work.



The Vascular System


The vascular system
 is composed of vessels that transport the blood throughout the body. Their size and structure vary throughout the vascular tree, with each portion of the vascular system having a specific structure and function related to the overall function of the cardiovascular system. Blood vessels, except for capillaries, have three layers; the adventitia (outer layer), tunica media (middle layer), and tunica intima (innermost layer) (Figure 11.10
). The adventitia
 is composed of connective tissue and attaches the blood vessel to surrounding tissue. The tunica media
 contains smooth muscle, which is critical for controlling the vessel’s diameter, and connective tissue, and gives the vessel elasticity and strength. The intima consists of a single layer of endothelial cells, the endothelium
, and a thin layer of
 connective tissue (basal lamina). The endothelium serves as the barrier between blood and underlying tissue and:

The vessels of the vascular system, along with various circulations, are illustrated in
 
Figure 11.11

.










FIGURE 11.11
 Schematic of the Vascular System.




Arteries


The arteries are thick-walled conduit vessels that carry blood from the heart to the body’s organs (see Figure 11.10
). Arteries contain a large amount of elastic connective tissue that allows them to distend when blood is ejected into them during systole and to recoil during diastole. Blood flow in the arteries is pulsatile owing to the pumping action of the heart (see Figure 11.15C
).



As the left ventricle ejects blood into the aorta, the blood stretches the aorta’s elastic walls. Blood pressure (BP) is the force exerted on the wall of the blood vessel by the blood.
 Systolic blood pressure (SBP)
 is the force exerted on the wall of the blood vessel by blood during systole. During relaxation of the heart (diastole), the arterial walls recoil, maintaining pressure on the blood still in the vessels. As a result, although the blood pressure drops during diastole, there is always some pressure in the arteries. Thus,
 diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
 is the force exerted on the wall of blood vessels by blood during diastole.
 Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
 is a weighted average of SBP and DBP, representing the mean driving force of blood throughout the arterial system. Typical resting blood pressure values for males and females at different ages are given in
 
Table 11.2

.

Arterioles



Arterioles
, also called resistance vessels
, are smaller than arteries and are the major site of resistance in the vascular system. Because of their ability to change diameter, these vessels play a critical role in determining the distribution
 of blood to various organs. This is important since we have a limited amount of blood. Blood flow to working tissues needs to be increased while the nonactive tissues may receive less blood flow.



Because of increased resistance in the arterioles, the pulsatile arterial blood flow becomes continuous before it reaches the capillaries (see
 
Figure 11.15C

). Arterioles absorb the pulsatile force of blood flow because they contain a large amount of elastic tissue. Imagine bouncing a basketball on a gymnasium floor and on a wrestling mat. The ball rebounds from the gym floor at an angle and height proportional to the force imparted by your muscle action. However, the same force will not produce much (if any) rebound from the wrestling mat. The elastic tissue in the walls of the arteries absorbs the energy from the pulsatile blood flow in a similar way that the mat absorbs energy from the basketball. In an individual with reduced elasticity, or arterial stiffening, the arteries, like the gym floor, are not able to distend as readily, resulting in elevated blood pressure.




The smooth muscle surrounding arterioles is able to contract and relax. Contraction of the smooth muscle around an arteriole results in
 vasoconstriction
, a decrease in vessel diameter and therefore a decrease in blood flow to a given region. Relaxation of the smooth muscle results in
 vasodilation
, an increased vessel diameter, and therefore an increase in blood flow to a region. The vasoconstriction and vasodilation of the smooth muscles surrounding the arterioles are primarily responsible for determining blood flow distribution to various organs.




The degree to which an arteriole vasodilates or vasoconstricts depends on the balance of
 extrinsic
 (originating outside the part on which it acts) and
 intrinsic
 (originating within the part on which it acts) mechanisms. Extrinsic mechanisms are geared toward maintaining mean arterial pressure and include nervous stimulation and circulating hormones. Smooth muscle surrounding terminal arteries and arterioles is innervated by sympathetic neurons. Sympathetic stimulation causes most arterioles to vasoconstrict. However, during exercise, when the sympathetic nervous system is clearly activated, arterioles to the working muscles dilate in order to supply the working muscle with increased blood flow. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in accounting for this dilation is controversial. Although sympathetic vasodilatory fibers have been identified in several species, and postulated in humans, there is no direct evidence of vasodilatory sympathetic nerve fibers in humans (

Joyner and Dietz, 2003

).




Intrinsic (local) mechanisms that control arteriole diameter include
 myogenic
 (originating within the muscle) mechanisms,
 metabolic
 factors, and shear stress in the blood vessel that causes the release of local vasoactive substances. Myogenic control is accomplished by mechanisms that cause the vessels to dilate in response to decreased stretch (decreased flow) and vasoconstrict in response to increased stretch (increased flow). This reflex action helps to ensure that changes in blood pressure do

 not lead to dramatic changes in blood flow to a given vascular bed. The metabolic control of vascular diameter plays a critical role in determining the degree of smooth muscle contraction and hence local blood flow. When tissue is metabolically active, such as skeletal muscle during exercise, it produces metabolic by-products that act locally to cause vasodilation, thereby increasing blood flow to the metabolically active area. Thus, contracting skeletal muscles act locally (intrinsically) on the smooth muscle surrounding the arterioles to increase blood flow in that region during exercise. In the case of exercise, the local vasodilatory effects have a greater effect on vessel

 diameter in arterioles supplying the skeletal muscle than the sympathetic vasoconstrictor effects, leading to vasodilation in the skeletal muscle. On the other hand, arterioles supplying nonworking muscle and other organs (stomach, kidneys) constrict, resulting in decreased blood flow to these areas during exercise due to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The decrease in blood flow to nonworking areas while increasing blood flow to working muscles reflects a delicate interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to distribute cardiac output (total blood flow) effectively. The balance of vasoconstriction/vasodilatation also helps ensure that blood pressure does not change dramatically. The endothelium also releases vasoactive substances that regulate vascular tone, and hence vessel diameter. For example, an increase in shear stress (caused by blood flow) is associated with the release of nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium, which causes smooth muscle surrounding the vessel to relax, thus causing vasodilation. Conversely, other substances released from the endothelium, such as endothelin-1, are potent vasoconstrictors.



Capillaries


The capillaries
 perform the ultimate function of the cardiovascular system: transferring gases and nutrients between the blood and tissues. Some exchange of gases occurs in the smallest vessels on both sides of the capillaries (collectively termed the exchange vessels
), but most of the gas exchange occurs across the capillary wall. The walls of the capillaries are very thin, essentially composed of a single layer of endothelial cells (Figure 11.10
). Capillaries have a very small diameter, such that red blood cells often must pass through in single file.



Blood flow through capillaries also depends on the other vessels that make up the microcirculation. As shown in
 
Figure 11.12

, the
 microcirculation
 includes several vessels: arterioles, venules, arteriovenous anastomoses, metarterioles, and true capillaries.
 Anastomoses
 are wide, connecting channels that act as shunts between arterioles and venules. These vessels are not common in most tissue but are abundant in the skin and play an important role in thermoregulation (

Levick, 2003

). When anastomoses are open, large volumes of blood can be directed to blood vessels close to the surface of the skin, facilitating heat dissipation. A
 metarteriole
 is a short vessel that connects an arteriole with a venule, creating a direct route through the capillary bed. The metarteriole gives rise to the capillaries.
 True capillaries
 vary in number depending on the capillary bed. Smooth muscles around these vessels that relax or constrict in response to local chemical conditions control blood flow through the capillaries. Thus, a capillary bed can be perfused with blood or be almost entirely bypassed, depending on the needs of the tissue it supplies.










FIGURE 11.12
 Anatomy of the Microcirculation.




GAS EXCHANGE The exchange of gases and nutrients in the capillaries depends on diffusion
. For a substance to diffuse from a capillary into a cell, it must cross two membranes: the capillary wall (composed primarily of endothelium) and the cell membrane. Substances pass from the capillary to the interstitial space by the process of diffusion. Movement from the interstitial space into the cell may also occur by diffusion or may require carrier-mediated transport. The movement of gases and nutrients into and out of the capillaries depends on the concentration gradient or pressure gradient of the substance or gas that is diffusing.



As discussed in
 
Chapter 9

, oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse down pressure gradients. Oxygen diffuses down

 its pressure gradient from systemic capillaries into muscle cells. Therefore, there is less oxygen in the veins draining skeletal muscles than in the arteries supplying them. The difference in the oxygen content of the arteries and veins is termed the
 a-vO
2
 difference
, which reflects the oxygen taken up by the skeletal muscles.



MOVEMENT OF FLUIDS Fluids also pass through the capillary membrane. The movement of fluids is determined by two opposing forces: hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure
, created by blood pressure, acts to “push” fluid out of the capillaries. Osmotic pressure
, caused by the larger concentration of proteins in the capillaries, acts to “pull” water into the capillaries. The net result of these opposing forces is the loss of approximately 3 L of fluid a day from the plasma into interstitial spaces (Marieb and Hoehn, 2016
). This fluid returns to the blood via the lymphatic system. Any change in hydrostatic pressure or osmotic pressure of the blood will alter the fluid exchange between the blood and the interstitial fluid.


Venules


The venules are small vessels on the venous side of the vascular system. These vessels contain some smooth muscle, which can influence capillary pressure. The venules and capillaries constitute the microcirculation where gas and nutrient exchange occurs. Venules empty into veins.


Veins


Veins, also called capacitance vessels
, are low-resistance conduits that return blood to the heart (Figure 11.10
). They contain smooth muscle innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, which can change their diameter. Contraction of smooth muscle around the veins is known as venoconstriction
; relaxation of the veins is known as venodilation
. Because veins can expand (distensibility), they can pool large volumes of blood—up to 60% of the total blood volume at rest—and therefore are sometimes referred to as a blood reservoir. The amount of blood in all the veins varies with posture and activity. If blood accumulates in the veins and is not returned to the heart, ventricular end–diastolic volume decreases, and hence stroke volume decreases. Conversely, venoconstriction can significantly increase ventricular end–diastolic volume and thereby lead to an increase in stroke volume, according to the Frank-Starling law of the heart.



The skeletal muscle pump and the respiratory pump help increase venous return by “massaging” blood back toward the heart. The one-way valves in the veins also help regulate venous pressure and are particularly helpful in counteracting the effects of gravity that oppose blood flow back to the heart because they prevent the backward flow of blood. Additionally, the increased sympathetic nervous activity during exercise helps to increase venous return via venoconstriction.



Blood


Blood is the fluid that circulates through the heart and the vasculature to transport nutrients and gases. Blood contains living blood cells suspended in a nonliving fluid matrix called plasma. Figure 11.13
 depicts blood that has been centrifuged to separate the cells and the plasma. Blood cells are classified as erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC) or leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC). Blood cells account for 38–45% of the total blood volume in adult females and 43–48% of the total blood volume in adult males. The ratio of blood cells to total blood volume is known as hematocrit
 and is usually expressed as a percentage.









FIGURE 11.13
 Components of Blood.
 A.
 Whole blood is composed of formed elements and plasma, which can be separated by “spinning the blood” in a centrifuge. B.
 Formed elements (platelets, leukocytes, and erythrocytes) as seen through a microscope (400×).





As discussed in the respiratory section, the RBCs transport oxygen from the lungs to body cells by binding oxygen to hemoglobin. Leukocytes are less numerous than erythrocytes, accounting for about 1% of total blood volume. Despite their seemingly small number,

 leukocytes are essential to the body’s defense against disease and play a critical role in inflammation.




Plasma accounts for approximately 55% of the volume of blood. It is composed primarily of water, which accounts for approximately 90% of its volume. It also contains over 100 dissolved solutes, including proteins, nutrients, electrolytes, and respiratory gases. The composition of plasma varies greatly, depending on the needs of the body. Plasma also plays an important role in thermoregulation by helping to distribute heat throughout the body.






FOCUS ON APPLICATION
 Clinically Relevant





Blood Donation and Exercise






When one donates blood, approximately one pint of blood (about 450–500 mL) is typically taken from the body. Because the total blood volume is approximately 5,000 mL (5 L), the donation results in roughly a 10% reduction in blood volume or a greater percentage in small individuals with less blood (typically women). The blood plasma volume is reestablished in approximately 24 hours, and red blood cells are replaced in about 6 weeks. Because of this reduction in plasma volume, it seems prudent for endurance athletes to avoid donating blood during the competitive phases of the training cycle. Strenuous activities should be avoided for 24 hours after giving blood to allow the body to replace the majority of the lost fluids. Plenty of water should be ingested following blood donation.







Training intensity may need to be slightly reduced pending complete RBC replacement for fitness participants or athletes who do donate blood.











Hormonal Control of Blood Volume


As is discussed in the accompanying Focus on Application: Clinically Relevant Box, blood volume is decreased by blood donation. Decreased blood volume may also result from profuse sweating and/or dehydration. Blood volume varies considerably among individuals and is affected by fitness status. Healthy adult males have an average blood volume of approximately 75 mL of blood per kg of body weight, or a total of approximately 5–6 L of blood. Healthy adult females have approximately 65 mL of blood per kg of body weight, which equals 4–4.5 L of blood for the average-sized woman. Children typically have about 60 mL of blood per kg of body weight, with total volume varying depending on body size.



Blood volume plays an important role in maintaining stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Under normal conditions, blood volume is maintained within physiological limits by overlapping and coordinating homeostatic mechanisms involving the endocrine system and urinary system. The major hormones involved in maintaining blood volume are antidiuretic hormone (ADH), released from the posterior pituitary gland, and aldosterone, released from the adrenal cortex.
 
Figure 11.14

 outlines the hormonal mechanisms that respond to a reduction in blood volume.










FIGURE 11.14
 Hormonal Control of Blood Volume.





Plasma volume reduction causes a decrease in atrial and arterial pressure. The decrease in pressure is sensed by atrial baroreceptors (
baro
 means “pressure”) and arterial receptors in the kidneys. Atrial baroreceptor activation leads to the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland, which causes the tubules of the kidneys to reabsorb water, thus increasing plasma volume.




A reduction in blood volume is also associated with an increase in plasma osmolarity (solute concentration). For example, with profuse sweating, more water than solutes is lost; thus, the osmolarity of the blood increases. An increase in osmolarity of the blood stimulates osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which signals the posterior pituitary gland to release ADH. ADH causes the kidneys to retain water, thus leading to an increase in blood volume.




Simultaneously, the receptors in the kidneys respond to decreased arterial pressure by releasing the enzyme renin. Renin is necessary for the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II signals the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain salt and water. Angiotensin II also has a vasoconstrictor effect on arterioles, thus helping to increase

 blood pressure.





Cardiovascular Dynamics




The different components of the cardiovascular system function together to meet the changing demands of the body. These components are highly integrated and interdependent. Although both the heart and the vasculature respond independently to various conditions, they are interrelated because the response of the heart affects the vessels and vice versa.



To differentiate the responses of the heart and the vessels, we commonly refer to central and peripheral cardiovascular responses.
 Central cardiovascular responses
 are those directly related to the heart: heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, etc.
 Peripheral cardiovascular responses
 are those occurring in vessels: vasodilation, vasoconstriction, venous return, etc.



Cardiac Output (
)


As described earlier, cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected from the ventricles each minute. This volume of blood changes constantly to meet the body’s metabolic demands. The volume of blood flow can be described using the basic formula presented in Chapter 9
 to describe air flow (F = ΔP/R). Applied to the cardiovascular system, this equation is


11.5 




In this formula, cardiac output represents the blood flow for the entire cardiovascular system, mean arterial pressure reflects the pressure gradient driving blood through the vascular system, and total peripheral resistance refers to the factors that oppose blood flow in the entire system. Technically, the equation

 should use the difference in pressure (∆P) between mean arterial pressure and the pressure in the right atrium (where blood is flowing to). However, since pressure in the right atrium is so low (<4 mmHg), it is considered negligible and is not usually given in the formula. Thus, mean arterial pressure is used alone in the equation.



Mean Arterial Pressure


Mean arterial pressure represents the driving force of blood through the vascular system. Adequate MAP is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion of all the vital organs of the body. On the other hand, excess blood pressure can damage the endothelial lining of the blood vessels. Thus, MAP is a physiological variable that is tightly controlled by homeostatic mechanisms. MAP can be expressed in relation to 

 and TPR by rearranging the equation above to become


11.6 



Total Peripheral Resistance



Total peripheral resistance (TPR)
, or simply resistance (R)
, results from factors that oppose blood flow. It is expressed in millimeters of mercury per milliliter per minute (mmHg·mL−1
·min−1
) or more simply as TPR units. Most of the resistance in the vascular tree results from the friction of blood against vessel walls, and it varies depending on the size of the vessel. The three primary factors that affect resistance and their mathematical relationship are described by Poiseuille’s law:





Central Cardiovascular Responses
 Responses directly related to the heart.



Peripheral Cardiovascular Responses
 Responses directly related to the vessels.



Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) or Resistance (R)
 The factors that oppose blood flow.




11.7 




Thus, the more viscous the blood is, the greater the resistance to flow. The longer the blood vessel, the greater the friction between the vessel walls and the blood. Under normal conditions, however, a vessel’s length and blood viscosity do not change substantially. On the other hand, the vessel’s radius can change considerably because of vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Furthermore, because the resistance is inversely related to the fourth power of the radius, a small change in vessel diameter can result in a large change in blood flow. Thus, vessel radius is by far the most important factor determining resistance to blood flow. Recall that vessel diameter is affected by local conditions (local control) and neural innervation (extrinsic control).




Total peripheral resistance (TPR) can be calculated by rearranging the formula
 

 to solve for TPR, provided that the flow rate (


) and blood pressure (MAP) are known. The formula for TPR becomes



11.8

Principles of Blood Flow



Figure 11.15
 presents the relationships among the cross-sectional area of the blood vessels, blood pressure, and blood velocity throughout the vascular system. The diameter of the various vessels is shown in Figure 11.15A
, and the total cross-sectional area of the various vessels is shown in Figure 11.15B
. Thus, although a single capillary is incredibly small, approximately 6 mm, there are so many capillaries that the total cross-sectional area far exceeds that of the other vessels. Figure 11.15B
 also depicts the velocity of blood in the various vessels—that is, the speed at which blood flows. The velocity of a fluid in a closed system varies inversely with the total cross-sectional area at any given point. Therefore, the velocity of blood flow decreases dramatically in the capillaries. This decreased velocity allows adequate time for the exchange of respiratory gases and nutrients.




Figure 11.15C

 depicts the blood pressure throughout the vascular system. The driving force for the blood is the contraction of the myocardium. Blood flows because of a pressure gradient. Thus, blood flows through the

 vascular tree because pressure is highest in the aorta and major arteries and lowest in the great veins and right atrium of the heart. Pressure continues to decrease as the blood travels further from the heart, reaching a low of approximately 4 mmHg in the right atrium. In fact, one-way venous valves and muscle and respiratory pump activity are needed to help return blood to the heart.





Regulation of the Cardiovascular System




The cardiovascular system is regulated by interrelated and overlapping mechanisms, including mechanical events, neural control, and neurohormonal control. Mechanical events, such as muscle action, influence venous return and thereby help regulate stroke volume and cardiac output. This regulation is particularly important during exercise. Neural and neurohormonal mechanisms of cardiovascular control are more complex and are discussed in detail in the following sections.


Neural Control


Three cardiovascular centers are located within the medulla oblongata of the brainstem (Figure 11.16
). These regulatory centers play an important role in controlling the output of the heart and the radius of the blood vessels. The cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitor centers innervate the heart. As the names imply, the cardioacceleratory center
 sends signals, via sympathetic accelerator nerves, that cause the heart rate to increase and the force of contraction to strengthen. The cardioinhibitor center
, also called the vagal nucleus, sends signals via the vagus nerve that causes a decreased heart rate and force of contraction. The vasomotor center

 innervates the smooth muscles of the arterioles via sympathetic nerves. Activation of these sympathetic fibers generally causes vasoconstriction (sympathetic fibers to the skin are the only clear exception to this rule in humans).



In summary, activation of sympathetic nervous system leads to an increased heart rate, increased cardiac contractility, and vasoconstriction in most arterioles. During exercise, there is also vasodilation in the arterioles of skeletal muscle, but the role of the autonomic nervous system in this response is not clear. What is clear is that metabolic (intrinsic) controls lead to a wide spread vasodilation in arterioles supplying skeletal muscle in response to increased metabolic activity during exercise. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system leads to the opposite responses in each of the above.



See animation, Neural Control of CV System, at http://thePoint.lww.com/Plowman5e
 .


Anatomical Sensors and Factors Affecting Control of the Cardiovascular System


The cardiovascular centers—and therefore, the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow from those centers—are influenced by several factors in a variety of circumstances, including exercise. Figure 11.17
 schematically presents the most important factors influencing the cardiovascular centers. These factors are described in detail in the following sections.


Higher Brain Centers


The cardiovascular medullary centers are influenced by several higher brain centers, including the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus. Emotional influences arising from the cerebral cortex can affect cardiovascular function at rest. Input from the motor cortex, which is relayed through the hypothalamus, can influence cardiovascular function during exercise, leading to an increase in heart rate and vasodilation in active muscle. The influence of the cortex and hypothalamus on the cardiovascular centers during exercise is often termed “central command,” denoting that the signal to alter cardiovascular variables comes from the central nervous system.



Body temperature also affects the cardiovascular centers through the influence of the hypothalamus. An increased body temperature results in an increased heart rate, increased cardiac output, and vasodilation in the arterioles of the active muscles and skin.



Systemic Receptors


Systemic receptors are present in the great veins, the heart, and the arterial system. These receptors provide sensory information to the cardiovascular control centers that leads to reflex action.


BARORECEPTORS Baroreceptors (pressor sensors) are located in the aorta and carotid bodies. With an increase in mean arterial pressure, these receptors cause a reflex decrease in mean arterial pressure through a decreased heart rate (and thus decreased cardiac output). The decrease in heart rate is mediated through an increased parasympathetic outflow and a simultaneous decrease in sympathetic outflow to the heart. This reflex control of blood pressure is called the baroreceptor reflex
.



Because this reflex functions to maintain mean arterial blood pressure, you may wonder how someone becomes hypertensive (high blood pressure) or why mean arterial blood pressure goes up during exercise.

 In someone with hypertension, the action of the baroreceptors is mediated by a set point. If something causes the resting blood pressure to be elevated (and no one knows precisely what causes this elevation), the baroreceptors fire for about 24 hours in an effort to bring down the mean arterial pressure. If this is unsuccessful, the baroreceptors appear to simply reset at a level above the previous value. The baroreceptor reflex is also reset during exercise. The resetting of the baroreflex is in direct proportion to exercise intensity (

Raven et al., 2006

). The baroreceptor reflex is also very important in achieving recovery to baseline values after exercise.



STRETCH RECEPTORS Stretch receptors, located in the right atrium of the heart, are stimulated by an increase in venous return. The signal is transmitted to the cardiovascular centers in the medulla, where they cause an increase in sympathetic outflow and a decrease in parasympathetic outflow. This results in an increased heart rate and force of contraction, increasing cardiac output. This sequence is called the Bainbridge reflex
.


Chemoreceptors



Chemoreceptors
 are located in the aortic and carotid arteries. They are sensitive to arterial blood PO2
, PCO2
, and H+
. An increase in PCO2
 and H+
 or a decrease in PO2
 causes a reflex vasoconstriction of arterioles.


Muscle Joint Receptors



Muscle receptors
 include mechanical (mechanoreceptors
) and metabolic (metaboreceptors
) receptors located in the joints and muscles. These receptors send impulses to the brain, where the impulses synapse with the cardiovascular centers. When stimulated by muscle contraction, these receptors lead to an increased rate and force of heart contraction. Vasoconstriction occurs in inactive skeletal muscles.


Neurohormonal Control


The endocrine system also helps regulate the cardiovascular system. Considerable control is exerted by components of the autonomic nervous system and the hormones of the adrenal medulla. The previous section discussed the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart and the blood vessels. The sympathetic nervous system also innervates the adrenal medulla, causing the adrenal glands to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones travel in the bloodstream to the heart and the blood vessels. Generally, epinephrine and norepinephrine have the same effect on these target organs as the sympathetic nerve fibers innervating them.



In addition to the adrenal hormones, aldosterone and ADH help maintain blood volume and blood pressure as described in the section on blood volume.





Measurement of Cardiovascular Variables




Cardiovascular variables are routinely measured and monitored in sports, fitness, rehabilitation, and research settings. The following variables are measured in order to assess fitness, prescribe exercise, and monitor physiological responses to exercise. Most of these variables can be assessed both at rest and during submaximal or maximal exercise.


Cardiac Output


Recall that cardiac output (

) is equal to the product of stroke volume and heart rate (Equation 11.3
). However, because stroke volume has historically been very difficult to measure, cardiac output has been calculated from another known relationship described by the Fick equation
:


11.9 



See animation, Fick Principle, at http://thePoint.lww.com/Plowman5e
 .



The direct determination of cardiac output via the Fick equation requires measurement of both oxygen consumption and arteriovenous oxygen difference. Many laboratories can directly measure oxygen consumption (see
 
Chapter 4

). The assessment of arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO
2
diff), however, is more problematic. This invasive test requires a sample of arterial blood from an artery and a sample of mixed venous blood from the vena cava or right atrium. Other invasive tests that are used clinically to measure
 

 include dye dilution and thermodilution (

Barker et al., 1999

;
 
Warburton et al., 1999

). Dye dilution is based on the same principle as the Fick method but instead of measuring O
2
 concentrations, the concentration of a dye is measured. A dye is injected into the venous circulation, and the concentration of dye in arterial blood is sampled and used to calculate the
 

. The thermodilution method is based on the same principle as dye dilution except that instead of injecting a dye, this technique uses the injection of a cold fluid on the venous side. Blood in the pulmonary artery is then sampled to determine the extent of cooling. The amount of cooling is inversely proportional to
 

 (

Darovic, 1995

;
 
Warburton et al., 1999

). Although the methods discussed above are considered criterion

 measures in a clinical setting, they are difficult to obtain in most exercise science research settings. Noninvasive measures of
 

 include variations of acetylene (C
2
H
2
), nitrous oxide (N
2
O), or carbon dioxide (CO
2
) gas-rebreathing techniques to estimate
 

. These inert gases rapidly diffuse across the lung blood-gas barrier but are limited by capillary perfusion. Thus, the rate of disappearance of the gas is directly proportional to the flow of blood through the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary blood flow is equivalent to systemic blood flow (


) (

Warburton et al., 1999

).




Given the difficulties of obtaining a direct measurement of
 

, researchers often take the approach of measuring SV and HR and calculating
 


.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Cardiovascular Responses to Exercise






Researchers interested in quantifying cardiovascular responses to exercise often rely on both easily obtained measurements and measurements requiring sophisticated laboratory equipment. In this study, Doppler echocardiography (an ultrasound system that is typically found only in hospital settings or well-equipped laboratories; see Figure 11.18
) was used to investigate the stroke volume response to isometric contraction. Investigators had young boys between the ages of 7 and 12 years perform isometric leg extension exercises at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for 3 minutes. Researchers measured systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) through standard auscultatory methods (see Figure 11.20
) and then calculated mean arterial pressure (MAP). The results of this study when compared with previous research on young adult males suggest that young boys respond to isometric exercise in much the same way that young adult males do, with an increase in MAP and a small decrease in SV.

Stroke Volume


Advances in technology have made the assessment of stroke volume (SV) easier, particularly during exercise. Stroke volume can now be measured using Doppler echocardiography
. This is a technique that calculates stroke volume from noninvasive measurements of aortic cross-sectional area (CSA) and time-velocity integral (TVI) of the blood flow in the ascending aorta (Figure 11.18
) using this formula:

) and arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO2diff).

Note that for conversion purposes, cm
3
 = mL.




Two-dimensional echocardiography is used to measure aortic diameter (

Figure 11.18

). Cross-sectional area is then calculated from a geometric model using the following formula:



11.11 




Doppler ultrasound is used to assess blood velocity in the ascending aorta (

Figure 11.18B

). From the Doppler waveforms, a time-velocity integral is obtained. Once stroke volume is known, cardiac output can be calculated

 using the formula
 








Example






Using the information provided in Figure 11.18C and D
, calculate SV.







The calculations are:












The Doppler method does not require a steady state and thus is a viable option for assessing SV (and
 

) during maximal exercise. Disadvantages of the Doppler method include the high cost of the equipment and the training required to obtain good time velocities, especially during heavy exercise (

Rowland and Obert, 2002

).



Heart Rate


In a laboratory, heart rate is often obtained by measuring the R-R interval in an ECG recording (Figure 11.19
). Although the ECG equipment/computer may be programmed to automatically calculate the HR, it is useful to know how this measure is performed. The first step is to calculate the distance the ECG paper travels in one
 minute based on the speed of the paper. The distance between cycles is then measured. Because you now know the number of cycles that occurred within the distance measured, you can solve for the b·min−1
 by solving for X in the following equation:


11.12 







Example






Using the ECG strip in Figure 11.19
, calculate the heart rate.




Step 1: Using the paper speed, calculate the distance the paper travels in one minute. Paper speed equals 25 mm·sec−1
. Since there are 60 sec·min−1
, 25 mm·sec−1
 × 60 sec·min−1
 = 1,500 mm·min−1
.


Step 2: Measure the distance between 4 cycles, which in this case is 125 mm.


Step 3: Since 4 cycles (1 box = 5 mm) occurred within the time period required for the ECG paper to travel 125 mm, you calculate how many beats occur in 1 minute by solving for X in the equation:









Heart rate can also be recorded by wireless telemetry. Most often, the transmitter is worn around the chest, and the heart rate signal is transmitted to a small receiver that looks very similar to a watch. Many pieces of fitness equipment also have the ability to pick up the HR signal from the transmitter or to measure heart rate by having the exercisers grasp a sensor built into the exercise equipment.




Heart rate is often measured during exercise to monitor exercise intensity. In some exercise sessions, however, heart rate-measuring devices are not available. Heart rate can then be assessed by counting the pulse—a method called palpation. The pulse can be felt at the carotid or radial artery. This technique requires instruction and practice.




To measure an exercise heart rate, the person usually pauses and finds the pulse as quickly as possible. The pulse count begins with zero and is counted for a set period of time, usually 6, 10, or 15 seconds, using a watch. This pulse count is then multiplied by 10, 6, or 4, respectively, to obtain the per-minute heart rate. A period less than 1 minute is used because the heart rate drops quickly once exercise is paused.



Maximal Oxygen Consumption



Maximal oxygen consumption
 is the highest amount of oxygen an individual can take in and utilize to produce energy (ATP) aerobically while breathing air during heavy exercise. It is abbreviated as 

 to indicate the maximal volume of oxygen consumed. The respiratory system brings in the oxygen from the environment, the cardiovascular system transports the oxygen, and the cells extract the oxygen and use it in the production of energy (ATP). The assessment of maximal oxygen consumption is therefore a means of quantifying the functional capacity of the entire cardiovascular system. 

 is often considered the single most important variable in describing an individual’s fitness level and is routinely used to describe an individual’s cardiorespiratory capacity.



The limit of cardiovascular function is reached at the highest attainable oxygen consumption. By rearranging the Fick equation (Equation
 
11.9

), this is expressed:



11.13 




Although
 

 can be calculated from the variables in Equation
 
11.13

, it is typically measured in the laboratory using open-circuit indirect spirometry with the equipment often organized into a metabolic cart. The assessment of oxygen consumption is described in detail in
 
Chapter 4

. Although oxygen is utilized only in aerobic metabolic production of ATP, the delivery of oxygen is primarily limited by the cardiovascular system. Thus,
 

 is considered to be a cardiovascular variable.



Field Tests of Cardiorespiratory Capacity


Several field techniques may be used to assess cardiorespiratory endurance and estimate cardiorespiratory capacity (

). The use of even estimated values optimizes the correct classification of health risk in health-related physical fitness tests (Cureton et al., 2013
). Field techniques include submaximal cycle ergometer tests, step tests, and distance walks or runs. By far, the most practical and inexpensive method, especially when large numbers of individuals are tested in a short period of time (such as in a school setting), is the distance run. Walking tests are recommended for testing the elderly, overweight, or very sedentary individuals. Three tests are described here: the 1-mile walk/run, the progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance run (PACER) (The Cooper Institute, 2010
), and the Rockport Fitness Walking Test (RFWT) (Kline et al., 1987
). All three are currently options in FitnessGram®, the assessment portion of the Presidential Youth Fitness Program (www.pyfp.org/assessment, 2015
).



The mile run test allows the individual to walk if necessary, but the intent is to cover the mile as quickly as possible, and that goal is best accomplished by running the entire distance. Thus, the individual is asked to perform at a high percentage of his or her maximal capacity for the entire test.




The
 

 estimate from the mile run is calculated as follows (

Cureton et al., 1995

)

:



11.14 




where age is the age of the individual in years; sex is 0 if female or 1 if male; BMI is the body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); and MT is the time it takes the individual to run a mile in minutes.







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Effect of Firefighting Gear on Maximal Oxygen Consumption






Firefighters perform strenuous physical work in hot and hostile environments. Because of the dangerous environment in which they work, firefighters must wear heavy protective clothing (firefighting gear) and a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). The weight of the gear and SCBA, and restrictions to breathing provided by the SCBA, however, may pose a significant physiological challenge to firefighters who are called upon to work at near-maximal levels.







In this study, researchers asked 12 healthy men familiar with exercise in the firefighting ensemble (mean age = 31.0 years; mean height = 179.8 cm; mean body weight = 83.0 kg) to perform a graded treadmill test to volitional fatigue (a
 

 test) under two conditions: once while wearing standard physical training (PT) clothing (shorts and a T-shirt) and once while wearing firefighting gear and SCBA (FFG). The treadmill test required each participant to initially walk at a constant speed (94 m·min
−1
) while grade increased by 2% every 2 minutes until 10% grade was reached. Subsequently, the grade was increased every 2 minutes until a 20% grade was achieved. After this point, increases in grade (2% increments) and speed (13 m·min
−1
 increments) were individually selected until volitional fatigue. The table below presents mean values for oxygen consumption and minute ventilation at 6, 12, and 18% grade (the last level that all participants could complete) and maximal values obtained at the end of the test.








Exercise in the firefighting gear led to an earlier onset of fatigue. Hence, the participants exercised longer and achieved a higher
 

 in the PT trial (52 mL·kg·min
−1
) versus the FFG trial (43 mL·kg·min
−1
). At every stage of the graded exercise test (above 4% grade), the oxygen cost of performing the work was greater when wearing the FFG than in the PT trial. Similarly, maximal minute ventilation (


) was higher in the PT condition (167 vs. 143 L·min
−1
) than in the FFG condition, but submaximal minute ventilation values were higher at each exercise workload when the work was performed in the FFG.








This study documented that there was a substantial (18% reduction) in
 

 in the FFG conditions compared to the PT condition. Furthermore, the data suggest that the decrease in maximal minute ventilation was the main reason for the decrease in oxygen consumption. The reason for the decreased minute ventilation at maximal exercise when wearing the SCBA is not clear, but may be related to the increased work of breathing due to expiratory resistance caused by the regulator. Thus, while firefighters require protective equipment to protect them from the environment they face, the protective equipment, especially the SCBA, has a negative effect on maximal oxygen consumption. These data, showing the elevated oxygen cost of doing physical work while wearing heavy protective equipment, highlight the importance of high physical fitness for firefighters.

Example






Estimate 

 given the following data:




Age = 15 years; BMI = 24.3 kg·m2



Sex = female; MT = 8.75 minutes





The calculation is












Note that the equation includes an indication of the standard error of the estimate (SEE). For
 

, acceptable errors generally range from 3 to 5 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
. The 4.8 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 for this equation falls within that range. The SEE means that as estimates, not measured values, the calculated results could vary from the measured value by that much. That is, the 40.97 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
 calculated in the example might actually be anywhere from 36.17 to 45.77 mL·kg
−1
·min
−1
.




The RFWT also covers a 1-mi distance; however, it is specifically designed for walking, with the fastest sustainable walking speed as the goal. Depending on the age and fitness level of the participant, this speed may or may not

 represent a high percentage of maximal aerobic capacity (

Kline et al., 1987

).




Unlike the previous set distance tests, the PACER is a multistage fitness test adapted from the 20-m shuttle run developed in Europe by Léger and his colleagues (

1982

,
 
1988

). It most closely resembles a graded exercise test that would be performed on a treadmill in a laboratory. It begins with a light workload and progresses, in small increments, until the individual can no longer complete the required number of laps per minute. This test is run between two lines marked 20 m apart on a smooth unobstructed surface. This test does not require a sustained high-intensity effort but a gradual progression from submaximal to maximal effort. Pacing is accomplished by prerecorded music or beeps (

The Cooper Institute, 2010

).




The equations used to estimate maximal oxygen consumption from the RFWT (

Kline et al., 1987

;
 
McSwegin et al., 1998

) and the PACER test (Léger et al.,
 
1988

;
 
Plowman and Liu, 1999

; Cureton et al., 2013) are given in Appendix B. Criterion-referenced norms are available for evaluation of the results of all these field tests (

The Cooper Institute, 2010

).



Blood Pressure


In well-equipped laboratories and hospitals, blood pressure can be measured directly by an intra-arterial transducer. A small transducer is inserted into the artery, and systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure are recorded for every beat of the heart. Although this procedure provides valuable information, it is not practical for routine use because as an invasive procedure it involves risks.



By far, the most common technique for obtaining blood pressure measurements is the
 auscultation
 method. The indirect method of auscultation uses a sphygmomanometer and a blood pressure cuff wrapped around the upper arm (

Figure 11.20A

). For a blood pressure measurement to be accurate and meaningful, the proper cuff size must be used to obtain the measurement. As a general rule, the BP cuff should encircle at least 80% of the arm circumference (

American College of Sports Medicine, 2005

). The blood pressure cuff is inflated to a pressure greater than systolic pressure (140 mmHg) as shown in
 
Figure 11.20B

. Note that systolic blood pressure (

Figure 11.20C

) is taken as the First Korotkoff sound (the first loud sound heard through the stethoscope), but that there are two diastolic blood pressures (

Figure 11.20D

). The first diastolic blood pressure (DBP
1
) occurs when the sound heard through the stethoscope is muffled (the Fourth Korotkoff sound). The second diastolic blood pressure (DBP
2
) occurs when sound disappears through the stethoscope (the Fifth Korotkoff sound). The pressure at the Fifth Korotkoff sound (DBP
2
) is considered the best measure of diastolic blood pressure in normal adults at rest. However, DBP
1
 is recommended for children, for adults during exercise, and for adults if DBP
2
 is lower than 40 mmHg (

American Society of Hypertension, 1992

). This is important for an accurate description of blood pressure and in the calculation of mean arterial pressure (MAP)

.




In resting and exercise recovery situations, mean arterial pressure is determined by first calculating pulse pressure. Pulse pressure is equal to the difference between SBP and DBP
2
 (PP = SBP − DBP
2
). MAP is then calculated as




  (11.15a)



MAP is not simply computed as the average of SBP and DBP because diastole lasts longer than systole and is thus weighted more heavily in the computation of MAP.




For adults during exercise or for children at rest, MAP can be computed according to a modified equation that uses DBP
1
, (

Robinson et al., 1988

):




  (11.15b)



This formula provides a more accurate measurement of MAP during exercise because it gives less weight to DBP. Although both systole and diastole time shorten because of the increased heart rate, diastole shortens proportionally more.





SUMMARY





1.
 The primary functions of the cardiovascular system are to transport oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body and transport carbon dioxide and waste products from the cells; to regulate body temperature, pH levels, and fluid balance; and to protect the body from blood loss and infection.




2.
 The cells of the heart, called myocytes (or cardiac muscle cells) or collectively the myocardium, are functionally linked by intercalated discs with gap junctions. When one cell is depolarized, the stimulation spreads over the entire myocardium.




3.
 The heart has its own conduction system, consisting of the sinoatrial (SA) node, intermodal fibers and Bachmann’s bundle, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the bundle of His, the left and right bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers, all of which rapidly spread the electrical signal throughout the heart.




4.
 The cardiac cycle refers to the alternating periods of relaxation and contraction of the heart. The contraction phase is called systole, and the relaxation phase is called diastole. There are known relationships among the electrical, pressure, volume, and contractile events throughout the cardiac cycle.




5.
 The volume of blood ejected from the heart with each beat is known as stroke volume. The amount of blood ejected from the heart each minute is called cardiac output. Under resting conditions, the heart ejects approximately 60% of the blood that is returned to it; this percentage represents the ejection fraction.




6.
 The cardiovascular system is primarily controlled by the medulla oblongata (cardioaccelerator, cardioinhibitor, and vasomotor centers). Factors affecting these centers include




a.
 Higher brain centers that exert conscious and unconscious control




b.
 Baroreceptors that are sensitive to mean arterial pressure




c.
 Stretch receptors that sense blood return to the right atrium




d. Chemoreceptors that sense the PO
2
, PCO
2
, and H
+




7.
 Maximal oxygen consumption (


) is the highest amount of oxygen that the body can take in, transport, and use. Assessment of
 

 allows for quantifying the functional capacity of the entire cardiovascular system and is related to health risks.
