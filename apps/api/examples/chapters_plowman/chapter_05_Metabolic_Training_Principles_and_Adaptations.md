 Metabolic Training Principles and Adaptations








OBJECTIVES




After studying the chapter, you should be able to:






Name and apply the training principles for metabolic enhancement.






Describe and explain the metabolic adaptations that normally occur as a result of a well-designed and carefully followed training program.






Discuss the influence of age and sex on the metabolic training adaptations.






Discuss the detraining response that occurs in the metabolic system.








Introduction





To provide a training program that meets an individual’s metabolic goals, the training principles must be systematically applied. How these principles are applied will determine the extent to which the body uses the aerobic and/or anaerobic systems of energy production. Which energy systems are emphasized will, in turn, determine the training adaptations that occur. Individualized training programs designed to bring about metabolic adaptations may be used to enhance performance in aerobic endurance or anaerobic events or health-related fitness.




Application of the Training Principles for Metabolic Enhancement




The training principles were described generically in Chapter 1. Each training principle can be applied specifically in relation to the metabolic production of energy to support exercise.


Specificity


In order to be specific and match the demands of the event, a training program must begin with determining the goal. For example, a 50-year-old male who is enrolled in a fitness program and wants to break 60 minutes in a local 10-km race will have a very different training program from a 16-year-old high school student competing in the 400- and 800-m distances.



With the goal established, the relative contributions of the major energy systems can be estimated using a graph such as the one shown in
 
Figure 3.3

. For the 50-year-old male described earlier, approximately 98% of the energy for his 60-minute, 10-km run is derived from the O
2
 system, with the remaining 2% from the adenosine triphosphate-phosphocreatine (ATP-PC) and lactic acid (LA) systems. These percentages vary little even if an individual’s time is considerably slower or even somewhat faster than 60 minutes. Thus, this individual’s training regimen should emphasize the O
2
 system.




For the high school middle-distance runner, it is a different story. Planning her training program requires knowing her typical times at those distances. In general, she would be expected to be in the 1:00–3:00-minute range for both distances. (The Track & Field News 2015 record for a high school female is 0:50.69 for the 400-m run [set in 2002] and 1:59.51 for the 800-m run [set in 2013].) Events in this range rely on approximately 60% anaerobic and 40% aerobic metabolism, with a heavier reliance on the ATP-PC and LA anaerobic systems as performance speed increases. Because a faster time is the goal, her training should emphasize the anaerobic systems without neglecting the O
2
 system.




In general, only by stressing the primary energy system or systems used in the activity can improvement be expected. The one exception to this rule appears to be the development of at least a minimal level of cardiorespiratory fitness, often termed an
 aerobic base
 for all sports. An aerobic base does not need to be obtained through long-distance running for all athletes. Other programs such as interval work may be more appropriate for sports that are basically anaerobic such as football (

Kraemer and Gómez, 2001

). Such a base should be achieved in the general preparatory phase (off-season) of a periodization schedule (see
 
Figure 1.7

). This base prepares the athletes for more intense and specific training for anaerobic sports and aids in recovery from anaerobic work (

Hoffmann et al., 2014

). The most specific training for metabolic improvement should occur in the specific preparatory phase (preseason) (see
 
Figure 1.7

).




For those sports in which performance is not measured in time (such as basketball, football, ice and field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, rugby, tennis, and volleyball), the sport’s separate components must be analyzed to determine which energy system supports it. For example, the average football play lasts 4–7 seconds and the total action in a 60-minute game (although perhaps spread over 3 hours) may be only 12 minutes. Thus, football training must emphasize the ATP-PC system (the 4–7-second range), not the O
2
 system (the 60-minute time). Conversely, soccer matches last (without added time) 90 minutes. During this time, soccer players may cover 6–7.5 mi interspersed with 20–60 sprints of 10–20 m lasting 2–3 seconds each. Obviously the aerobic load is much higher here, but the anaerobic requirement is high as well. In both cases, the ability to perform repeated short anaerobic bouts is very important and must be included in the training.




The time-honored technique of using fewer players on smaller fields, now called small-sided games (SSGs), is becoming more formalized by team sport coaches and investigated by researchers. SSGs involve a brief period (seconds to a few minutes) of high-intensity movement followed by a predetermined period of rest. For example, in soccer this might involve 3 on 3 play (+goalie) for 5 × 3 minutes games focusing on some aspect the coach wishes to improve progressing over a period of 6 weeks to 10 × 3 minutes games. All that is required to modify the intensity of the training is for the coach to manipulate the field dimensions, number of players on each side, time of play and time of rest. SSGs make excellent activities for the specific preparation phase (in-season), competitive phase, and/or tapering macro or micro cycles to enhance conditioning, continue tactical development, and reduce training volume. Acute physiological responses and training adaptations to SSGs have been found to be similar to high-intensity interval training when structured with that intent (

Hoffmann et al., 2014

;
 
Owen et al., 2012

).




Specificity also applies to the major muscle groups and exercise modality involved. Most biochemical training adaptations occur only in the muscles that have been trained repeatedly in the way in which they will be used. Thus, a would-be triathlete who emphasizes bicycling and running in his or her program but spends little time on swimming should be more successful (in terms of individual potential) competing in duathlons instead.



Overload


Overload of the metabolic systems is typically achieved in one of two ways: first, by manipulating time and distance and second, by monitoring lactate levels and adjusting
 work intensity accordingly. Maximal oxygen uptake (

), although a measure of aerobic power and a means of quantifying training load, is more a cardiovascular than a metabolic variable. Factors contributing to the improvement of 

 and the use of % 

 reserve as an overload technique are therefore primarily discussed in the section on application of the cardiorespiratory training principles (see Chapter 13
).


The Time or Distance Technique


The time or distance technique
 involves performing continuous and/or interval training. As the name implies, continuous training occurs when an individual selects a distance or a time to be active and continues uninterrupted to the end, typically at a steady pace. A runner who completes an 8-mi training run at a 7:30-min·mi−1
 pace has done a continuous workout. The interaction of intensity (speed) and duration is important in continuous endurance work with intensity being more important until an individual threshold level is reached and then duration at or above that intensity becomes paramount (Green et al., 2013
). If a continuous steady-state aerobic training session is maintained for an extended period of time or distance, it is sometimes called a long slow distance (LSD) workout
. If several periods of increased speed are randomly interspersed in a continuous aerobic workout, the term fartlek
 is used. Thus, a fartlek workout
, named from the Swedish word meaning “speed play,” combines the aerobic demands of a continuous run with the anaerobic demands of sporadic speed intervals. The distance, pace, and frequency of the speed intervals can vary depending on what the individual wishes to accomplish that day.



Interval training
 is an aerobic and/or anaerobic workout that consists of three elements: a selected work interval (usually a distance), a target time for that distance, and a predetermined recovery or relief period before the next work interval. The target time for any given distance should be based on the time trials or past performance of the individual at that distance. The time period of the work interval determines the energy system that is stressed. A work time of less than 30 seconds stresses the ATP-PC system; one between 30 seconds and 2 minutes stresses the LA system. Anything over 2–5 minutes primarily stresses the O
2
 system. The choice of length and type of recovery period also depends on the energy system to be stressed. Its length is typically between 30 seconds and 6 minutes, and the type may be rest-relief (which can include light aerobic activity and flexibility exercises) or work-relief (moderate aerobic activity). Examples of ATP-PC, LA, and O
2
 interval sets are presented in
 
Table 5.1

 (

Fox and Mathews, 1974

). Note that the three sets are not intended to be combined. In addition, other techniques for determining interval times can, of course, result in different target and recovery times for the same distance and ability level.




TABLE 5.1
 Examples of Time-Distance Interval Training for Runners*










*
This is not intended to be one workout, although the 100- and 400-m training sets could constitute one workout and the 1,200-m repeats another. Each would then total approximately 2 mi of intervals.



†
Based on 1–4 sec faster than average 400 m during the 1,500–1,600-m race. (1,500 m ÷ 100 m = 15; 5:16 = 316 sec ÷ 15 = 0:21·100 m−1
 × 4 = 1:24·400 m−1
; 1:24−0:04 = 1:20.)

 × 12 = 252 sec·1,200 m−1
 = 4:12 + 0:12 = 4:24.)




ATP-PC SYSTEM In this example of the ATP-PC set, the runner is doing 100-m sprints. Each repetition is to be run at 3 seconds slower (0:18) than her best time (0:15). A total of eight repetitions are to be completed with 0:54 of rest recovery (which may involve no or mild activity) between repetitions.





Long Slow Distance (LSD) Workout
 A continuous aerobic training session performed at a steady-state pace for an extended time or distance.



Fartlek Workout
 A type of training session, named from the Swedish word meaning “speed play,” that combines the aerobic demands of a continuous run with the anaerobic demands of sporadic speed intervals.



Interval Training
 An aerobic and/or anaerobic workout that consists of three elements: a selected work interval (usually a distance), a target time for that distance, and a predetermined recovery period before the next repetition of the work interval.





The amount of time required to restore half of the ATP-PC used—that is, the half-life restoration period for ATP-PC—is approximately 20–30 seconds, with full restoration taking at least 2 minutes to possibly 8 minutes (

Fox and Mathews, 1974

;
 
Harris et al., 1976

;
 
Hultman et al., 1967

). Thus, this individual should restore over half her ATP-PC while she rests

.




During the same recovery time, myoglobin O
2
 replenishment is also taking place. The amounts replenished and restored are influenced by the individual’s activity during the recovery phase, with the greatest restoration occurring with rest during recovery (

Dupont et al., 2004

).




Because the ATP-PC stores recover so quickly, they can be called upon repeatedly to provide energy. Repeatedly stimulating the ATP-PC system should bring about an increase in its capacity. Any major involvement of the LA system is avoided by keeping the work intervals short so that little lactate accumulation occurs.



LA SYSTEM Stressing the LA system requires work durations of 30 seconds to 2 minutes. In this example, the runner is asked to perform five repetitions of 400 m each at a speed of 1:20, with a work-relief recovery (which should include mild to moderate exercise) of 2:40 between repetitions. Lactic acid/lactate is produced in excess of clearance amounts during heavy work of this duration, resulting in an accumulation of lactate in the blood. Because lactate has a half-life clearance time of 15–25 minutes, with full clearance taking almost an hour, it is neither practical nor beneficial to allow for clearance of even half the accumulated lactate between repetitions.



Tolerance to lactate is increased by incomplete recovery periods of 1 minute 30 seconds to 3 minutes. This amount of rest allows the replenishment of myoglobin O
2
 as well as most of the ATP-PC, thus allowing the high-intensity work in the next work interval to be partially supplied by the ATP-PC energy system before stressing the LA system again (

Fox et al., 1969

). Of the three overload factors of frequency, intensity, and duration, intensity is most important for improving the capacity of the LA system. Work-relief recovery is typically used at these work times, since active recovery does speed up lactate clearance.



O2 SYSTEM Long work bouts that are a portion of the competitive event (e.g., 0.5–1-mi [800–1,600 m] repeats for a 10-km runner) can be performed to stress the O2
 system. The pace is typically close to average pace during competition and may exceed it. The smaller the proportion of the competitive distance that is performed with each repetition, the faster the pace and the more repetitions performed. The intent is for the intervals to be done primarily aerobically, however. The example in Table 5.1
 is for 1,200 m. Note that the time is longer than simply triple the 400-m time (4:12 vs. 4:24) and that the recovery time is proportionally very short. The 2:12 recovery allows for a large portion of ATP-PC restoration before the start of the next repetition. Because this pace is already relatively low-intensity work, a rest or walking recovery (as opposed to jogging) is best.



The distance for an interval workout (excluding warm-up and cooldown) should rarely exceed 2–5 mi (3.2–8 km) with a frequency of 1–3 d·wk
−1
 (

Costill, 1986

;
 
Rennie, 2007

). High-intensity interval training taxes the muscles and joints, and one must be careful to avoid injury or overtraining. (

Chapter 22

 lists the signs and symptoms of overtraining.) Continuous work at lower intensities allows for greater frequency and longer durations, both of which lead to a greater volume of training. A high training volume is particularly important to endurance athletes.




Although originally used primarily by athletes, interval training in the format of low-volume high-intensity workouts is now becoming popular for fitness and rehabilitation training. These workouts are popular in part because the time commitment can be lower than with continuous endurance work and studies have shown that results are similar to continuous endurance work (

Gist et al., 2014

;
 
Nalcakan, 2014

;
 
Kessler et al., 2012

;
 
Weston et al., 2014

).



The Lactate Monitoring Technique


Assessing blood lactate concentration ([La−
]) is the second common technique for monitoring overload. Ideally, this technique involves the direct measurement of blood lactate levels from a given workout. Currently, there is no general agreement about how best to use blood lactate values to design and monitor training programs. Nomenclature also varies greatly. Generally, however, six categories of workouts or training zones are useful (Table 5.2
). These training zones are based on the lactate thresholds (LT1 and LT2) obtained during incremental exercise to maximum. The zones overlap considerably. The three lower zones (recovery, extensive aerobic, and intensive aerobic) involve predominantly low- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity, whereas the three higher zones (threshold, 

, and anaerobic) represent the transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy supply at progressively higher intensities until both aerobic and anaerobic energy productions are maximized (Anderson, 1998
; Bourdon, 2000
).

; Bourdon (2000)
.





Although it is done for elite athletes, and small lactate monitors that can be easily used outside of the laboratory are available, direct measurement of [La
−
] during training for others is not very practical because of the necessity and cost of taking multiple blood samples. Some studies (

Stoudemire et al., 1996

;
 
Weltman, 1995

) have demonstrated a reasonably stable relationship between blood lactate values and Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6–20 scale (

Borg, 1998

). Borg’s RPE scale is described fully in
 
Chapter 13

. The range of RPE values corresponding approximately to lactate values for each training zone is presented in
 
Table 5.2

.




A better method to individualize the use of RPE is to test the individual in a laboratory and record both RPE and lactate values at each progressive work rate.
 
Figure 5.1

 presents an example of such results. This individual reached his LT1 at 220 m·min
−1
. At that speed, he reported an RPE of 12. He reached LT2 at a speed of 260 m·min
−1
 with an RPE of 14. Combining these results with the guidelines from
 
Table 5.2

 means that his recovery workouts should be performed at an RPE of 9–12, extensive aerobic workouts at 12 or 13, intensive aerobic at 13–14, threshold workouts at 14, and
 

 at an RPE of at least 15. The test results presented in
 
Figure 5.1

 do not represent a maximal test for this individual. Maximal workouts should elicit at least an RPE of 17 for everyone. Thus, an individual can be given a workout and an RPE value and can adjust his or her intensity accordingly. An alternative method, when a laboratory testing facility is available, is to determine the

 relationship between [La
−
] and HR values. Then, HR can be used to estimate the [La
−
] level during training sessions, and the intensity modified accordingly (

Dwyer and Bybee, 1983

;
 
Gilman and Wells, 1993

).










FIGURE 5.1
 Heart Rate, Lactate, and Perceived Exertion Responses to Incremental Exercise as a Basis for Exercise Prescription.
 LT1 occurred at 220 m·min−1
 and LT2 at 260 m·min−1
 for the individual whose data are plotted. See text for the explanation of how these points are used to prepare an exercise prescription.





In our example, now reading the rectilinear plot as heart rate, the individual would perform recovery activity between approximately 110 and 140 b·min
−1
; extensive aerobic exercise bouts between 110 and 155 b·min
−1
; intensive aerobic exercise between 120 and 165 b·min
−1
; threshold workouts between 157 and 173 b·min
−1
;
 

 workouts close to 170 b·min
−1
; and maximal activity at least at 185 b·min
−1
.




Heart rate reflects primarily the functioning of the cardiovascular system, but lactate levels reflect the metabolic energy system.
 
Fox et al. (1988)

 estimate that if the HR-[La
−
] relationship is not individually determined to ensure that all individuals are working at or above their “anaerobic threshold,” heart rate would have to be greater than 90% of the maximal heart rate or equal to or greater than 85% of the heart rate reserve in order to use it for anaerobic exercise prescription. Experimental data reported by
 
Weltman (1995)

 confirm that techniques for exercise prescription involving percentages of heart rate maximum or heart rate reserve do not reflect specific blood lactate concentrations. Thus, unless individually correlated with lactate values, heart rate cannot be used for anaerobic exercise prescriptions. Regardless of the system used to prescribe an individual’s training session, a mixture of workout types in a periodized format (

Chapter 1

) should be used to maximize the possibility for improvement, minimize the possibility of overtraining, and prevent boredom.Complete the Check Your Comprehension 1 box to evaluate your understanding of intensity overload.

Rest/Recovery/Adaptatio
n


Adaptation is evident when a given distance or workload can be covered in a faster time with an equal or lower perception of fatigue or exertion and/or in the same time span with less physiological disruption (lower [La−
] values) and faster recovery. The key to adaptation for energy production in muscles appears to be allowing for sufficient recovery time between hard-intensity workouts. Periodized training programs that alternately stress the desired specific energy system on a hard day and allow it to recover on an easy day lead to optimal adaptation (Bompa, 1999
; McCafferty and Horvath, 1977
; Weltman et al., 1978
). Too many successive hard days working the same muscles and same energy system can lead to a lack of adaptation because of overtraining, and too many successive easy days can lead to a lack of adaptation because of undertraining.



Recently, there has been much interest in the use of modalities to enhance recovery between training sessions or within tournament structures requiring multiple competitions. Overall, studies have not found massage, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (exposure to whole-body pressure >1 atmosphere while breathing 100% oxygen), stretching, or electromyostimulation (the transmission of electrical impulses through surface electrodes to stimulate motor neurons and induce muscle contraction) advantageous. Research results for using water immersion depend on the temperature of the water. Cold water (≤20°C) and contrast water therapy [alteration of cold and hot (36–38°C)] offer more benefits than does either hot water immersion alone or thermoneutral immersion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have potential negative health outcomes (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal) and may negatively affect muscle repair and adaptation to training. Insufficient data are available to evaluate compression garments (stockings, sleeves, tights, and tops) (

Barnett, 2006

;
 
King and Duffield, 2009

;
 
Malone et al., 2014

Montgomery et al., 2008

;
 
Poppendieck et al., 2013

;
 
Versey et al., 2013

;
 
Wilcock et al., 2006

).



Progression


Once adaptation occurs, the workload should be progressed if maximizing improvement is desired (McNicol et al., 2009
). Progression can involve increasing the distance, speed, workload, number of repetitions, or sessions; decreasing the length of the relief interval; or changing the frequency of the various types of workouts per week. The key to successful progression is an increase in intensity and total training volume
. The progression should be gradual. A general rule of thumb is that training volume—the total amount of work done, usually expressed as mileage or load—should not increase more than 10% per week. For example, for an individual currently cycling 60 mi·wk−1
, the distance should not be increased by more than 6 mi the following week. Steploading, as described in Chapter 1
, should be used.



Often in fitness work, the challenge is to prevent an individual from doing too much too soon. For example, a 50-year-old man remembers being a high school star athlete and wants to regain that feeling and physique—now! Fitness leaders must gently help such participants be more realistic and should err, if at all, on the side of caution in exercise prescription and progression.




Metabolic adaptation appears to plateau in approximately 10 days to 3 weeks if training is not progressed (

Hickson et al., 1981

). The ultimate limit may be set by genetics.



Individualization


The first step in individualizing training is to match the sport, event, fitness, or health goal of the participant with the specific mix of energy system demands. The second step is to evaluate the individual. The third step is to develop a periodization sequence for general preparation, specific preparation, competitive, and transition phases. The fourth step is to develop a format: the number of days per week for each type of training or energy system to be stressed. The fifth step is to determine the training load (distance, workload, repetitions, or the like) based on the individual’s evaluation and adjusted according to how he or she responds and adapts to the program. Interpreting and adjusting to an individual’s response is the art of being a coach or fitness leader.





Training Volume
 The total amount of work done, usually expressed as mileage or load.




Maintenance


Once a specific level of endurance adaptation has been achieved, it can be maintained by the same or a reduced volume of work. How the volume is reduced is critical. When training intensity is maintained, reductions of one third to two thirds in frequency and duration have been shown to maintain aerobic power (

), endurance performance (at a given absolute or relative submaximal workload), and lactate accumulation levels at submaximal loads. This maintenance may last for at least several months. One day per week may be sufficient for short periods of time (such as during a 1-wk vacation) if intensity is maintained (Chaloupka and Fox, 1975
; Neufer, 1989
; Weltman, 1995
). Conversely, a reduction in intensity brings about a decrease in training adaptation.



It also seems to be important that the mode of exercise is consistent with or closely simulates an athlete’s activity because many metabolic training adaptations are specific to the muscles involved. Thus, cross-training—the use of different modalities to reduce localized stress but increase the overall training volume—is likely to be more beneficial for the cardiovascular system than for the metabolic system.




The level of maintenance training necessary for the anaerobic energy systems to keep operating at maximal levels is unknown. Sprint performances are known to deteriorate less quickly than endurance performances,

 however, with a decrease in training (

Wilmore and Costill, 1988

).




Many fitness participants are primarily in a maintenance mode after the initial several months or the first year of participation. The appropriate level for maintenance should be based on the individual’s goals. For athletes, maintenance should occur primarily during the competitive training cycle.




A special kind of maintenance called tapering is often used by athletes in individual sports such as swimming, cycling, and running. A
 training taper
 is a reduction in training load before an important competition that is intended to help the athlete recover from previous hard training, maintain physiological conditioning, and improve performance. Athletes often fear that if they taper more than just a few days, their competitive fitness and performance will suffer. However, studies consistently show that if intensity is maintained while training volume is reduced, physiological adaptations are retained and performance either stays the same or improves after a taper (

Bosquet et al., 2007

Costill et al., 1985

).
 
Figure 5.2

 presents a schematic of the four different possible types of taper. Two of the variations are linear—one a gradual decrease in training load and the other making one large step down in training load and remaining at that level throughout the taper. Two of the variations are exponential, with either a large initial drop (fast decay) or slow initial drop (slow decay). Exponential techniques have been shown to be more effective than linear ones, and fast decay more beneficial than slow decay. Optimal tapering strategies include the following:

The art of tapering involves balancing the goals of minimizing fatigue but not compromising previously acquired adaptations and fitness level. Tapering appears to be beneficial to both male and female athletes. Done properly, tapering strategies can result in an improved performance of approximately 2–3% (range 0.5–6.0%) (

Bosquet et al., 2007

;
 
Mujika and Padilla, 2003

).

Retrogression/Plateau/Reversibility


Coaches and fitness leaders anticipate and react to, rather than apply, the training principles of retrogression, plateau, and reversibility. At one or more times in the process of training, an individual may fail to improve with progression and will either show a performance or physiological decrement (retrogression) or stay at the same level (plateau). When such a pattern of nonimprovement occurs, it is important to check for other signs of overtraining. Changing the training emphasis or including more easy days may be warranted. Remember that reducing training load does not necessarily lead to detraining. Of course, not all plateaus can be explained as overtraining; sometimes there is no explanation.



If an individual ceases training completely, for whatever reason, detraining or reversibility of the achieved adaptations will occur.



Warm-up and Cooldown


Information about the effects of warm-up on metabolic function is sparse, but several generalizations can be made. An elevated body temperature—and more specifically an elevated muscle temperature (Tm
)—increases the rate of metabolic processes in the cells. This increase occurs largely because enzyme activity is temperature-dependent, exhibiting a steady rise from 0°C to approximately 40°C before plateauing and ultimately declining. At the same time, at elevated temperatures, oxygen is more readily released from the red blood cells and transported into the mitochondria. Therefore, one consequence of an increased Tm
 is a greater availability of oxygen to the muscles during work. When more oxygen is available sooner, there is less reliance on anaerobic metabolism,
 and less lactate accumulates at any given heavy workload. At lighter endurance workloads, a greater utilization of fat for energy is possible earlier in the activity. This early use of fat spares carbohydrate and allows a high-intensity effort to be continued longer. Other metabolic benefits of an increased Tm
 include increased glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and ATP-PC degradation (Bishop, 2003
). These beneficial metabolic effects of a warm-up appear to occur in children and adolescents as well as adults (Bar-Or, 1983
).



As with the other training principles, to be effective, the warm-up needs to match the intensity and duration of the intended activity. In general, a warm-up should consist of three elements in this order: a period of aerobic exercise, stretching, and a period of activity similar to the event to be performed (

Fradkin et al., 2010

). In addition, the structure of the warm-up should depend on the participant’s fitness level, the environmental conditions, and specific constraints of the situation in which the warm-up will occur. Several guidelines are available for devising a warm-up to achieve these metabolic benefits and possibly improved performance (

Bar-Or, 1983

;
 
Bishop, 2003

;
 
Franks, 1983

;
 
Tomaras and MacIntosh, 2011

).




1.
 For a short-term (<10 seconds) high-intensity activity, the goal is to increase T
m
 but allow time for resynthesis of ATP-PC immediately before the activity. Research suggests a warm-up performed at approximately 40–60%
 

 (~60–70% HRmax) for 5–10 minutes followed by a 5-minute recovery period is optimal.




2.
 Explosive tasks (such as long or high jumping) at full speed should be used sparingly during warm-up even if they are to be performed during exercise or competition. However, a brief, task-specific burst of activity may be beneficial, or the action can be patterned at lower levels.




3.
 For an intermediate or long-term high-intensity activity, the goal is to elevate baseline oxygen consumption without either causing fatigue or imposing a high thermal load. Research suggests a warm-up performed at approximately 60–70%
 

 (~70–80% HRmax) for 5–10 minutes, followed by approximately 5 minutes of recovery for moderately trained individuals.

 The warm-up for endurance activities generally can occur at a lower intensity (25–30%
 

 or <35% HRmax) than for short or intermediate high-intensity activities. The warm-up may be built into an endurance workout if the participant begins at a low intensity and progresses nonstop into higher levels of work.




5.
 Very fit individuals can use longer, more intense warm-ups than can less fit individuals. Higher intensity

 may be needed by well-conditioned athletes to elevate their core temperature, but fatigue should be avoided. It is probably best to stay below the first lactate threshold and to avoid impacting glycogen stores negatively.




6.
 An intermittent or interval-type warm-up has been found to be more beneficial for children than a continuous warm-up.Complete the Check Your Comprehension 2 box to assess your understanding of the benefits of warm-up on metabolism.




The primary metabolic value of a cooldown lies in the fact that lactate is dissipated faster during an active recovery. As described in
 
Chapter 3

, the lactate clearance rate is maximized if the cooldown activity is of moderate intensity (a little higher than an individual tends to self-select) and continues for approximately 20 minutes.




In general, all training principles appear to apply to both sexes and, except where noted, to all ages. At the very least, there is insufficient evidence for modifying any of the general concepts based on age or sex, although individual differences should always be kept in mind.

The Effect of Warm-Up on Metabolism






Twelve female ballet dancers (age = 13.7 ± 10 years; HT = 1.61 ± 0.05 m; WT = 45 ± 7 kg; and

) at the Italian National Academy of Dance were tested to determine the effects of active warm-up on energy cost and energy source. As in classical dance practice, the warm-up consisted of 3 minutes of free jogging (25–35% 

), 15 minutes of stretching (10–20% 

), 2 minutes of pre barre,
 and 2:40 of plié
 dance exercises. The ballet dance exercise consisted of a sequence of 25 tours piques

The total energy requirement (

The metabolic demand was 1.6 times the dancers’

Metabolic Adaptations to Exercise Training




When the training principles discussed earlier are systematically applied and rigorously followed, a number of adaptations occur relative to the production and utilization of energy. The extent to which adaptations occur depends on the individual’s initial fitness level and genetic potential. Figure 5.3
 is an expanded version of Figure 2.4
, showing the metabolic pathways you studied earlier. Numbers have been inserted on the figure to indicate sites where these adaptations occur. The following discussion will follow that numerical sequence. Refer to Figure 5.3
 as you read.









FIGURE 5.3
 Metabolic Training Adaptations.
 The numbers in squares indicate sites where training changes occur. The blue
 boxes indicate processes. The green
 boxes indicate important substrates.




Substrate or Fuel Supply


Regulatory Hormones


Primary among the metabolic adaptations to a training program are changes that occur in the hormones responsible for the regulation of metabolism (see Chapters 2
 and 21
, Figure 2.17
, and Table 2.3
). Although little is known about the impact of training on the hypothalamic-releasing factors and adrenocorticotrophic hormone, a definite pattern occurs with the five hormones directly involved in carbohydrate, fat, and protein substrate regulation. That pattern is one of a blunted response in which the amount of hormone secreted during submaximal aerobic activity is reduced. This pattern occurs whether the load is absolute or relative and in both the fast-responding and slow-responding hormones. Thus, the rise in epinephrine and norepinephrine is less in the trained state. As a result, the rise in glucagon (stimulated by epinephrine) is lower and there is less suppression of insulin (caused by norepinephrine). Similarly, the rise in growth hormone and cortisol is less during submaximal exercise in trained individuals than in untrained individuals (Galbo, 1983
; Talanian et al., 2007
). Because of these smaller disruptions at submaximal levels, more work can be done before maximum is reached.


Carbohydrate (1)


The rate-limiting step for glucose utilization in muscles is glucose transport, and glucose transport is primarily a function of GLUT-4 transporters. Exercise training increases the GLUT-4 number and concentration in skeletal muscle, especially slow-twitch oxidative fibers (Daugaard et al., 2000
; Gibala and McGee, 2008
; Perry et al., 2008
; Sato et al., 1996
; Seki et al., 2006
). This results in a greater uptake of glucose under the influence of insulin. Thus, at any resting insulin level, the whole-body glucose clearance is enhanced. This occurs in both young and older healthy individuals as well as in individuals with non–insulin-dependent diabetes (Dela, 1996
). Despite this increase in the number of GLUT-4 transporters, endurance exercise training reduces glucose utilization during both absolute and relative, moderate-intensity submaximal exercise. This occurs because the translocation of GLUT-4 decreases during exercise. As a result, trained muscles take up and utilize less glucose than do untrained muscles during moderate exercise (Mougios, 2006
).



Both endurance and sprint training increase muscle and liver glycogen reserves. In addition, at the same absolute submaximal workload (the same rate of oxygen consumption), muscle and liver glycogen depletion occurs at a slower rate in trained individuals than in untrained individuals (

Abernethy et al., 1990

;
 
Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973

;
 
Gibala and McGee, 2008

Green et al., 2013

;
 
Holloszy, 1973

;
 
Holloszy and Coyle, 1984

;
 
Karlsson et al., 1972

). Thus, the trained individual uses less total carbohydrate in his or her fuel mixture. These changes result in lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values (

Figure 5.4A

). Because glycogen is the primary source of fuel for high-intensity work, a larger supply of glycogen used less quickly enables an individual to participate in fairly intense activities at submaximal levels longer before fatigue occurs. Furthermore, trained individuals are more able to directly oxidize lactate produced from high-intensity work, which allows glycolytic tissues to support oxidative tissues by redistributing carbohydrate fuel and sparing glycogen within exercising muscles (

Emhoff et al., 2013

).

 On the other hand, sprint training can also increase the rate of glycogenolysis at higher levels of work, giving the exerciser a fast supply of energy when needed for short bursts of maximal or supramaximal activity.

FOCUS ON RESEARCH
Substrate Training Adaptations in Children




As has been described, it is clear that in adults the primary substrate utilized to fuel exercise depends on the modality, intensity, and duration of the activity as well as the individual’s training status. The “crossover
” concept
 states that at some point, as the intensity increases during incremental exercise, the predominant fuel source shifts from fat to carbohydrate. The crossover point is the power output at which this occurs.







This study by Duncan and Howley shows that the same processes occur in children. Twenty-three volunteer boys and girls (aged 7–12 years) were divided into a training group (
N
 = 10) and a control group (
N
 = 13). All were tested for
 

 peak on a cycle ergometer and then at five power outputs designed to elicit approximately 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, and 75% of
 

 peak. RER values were determined by open-circuit spirometry for the five-stage submaximal test before and after 4 weeks of training. Training consisted of three 10-minute work bouts separated by 1–2 minutes of rest at roughly 50%
 

 peak, three times per week.








The results, presented in the accompanying graph, clearly show that as the intensity of the submaximal exercise increased, so did the percentage of carbohydrate utilized as fuel, both before and after the training. Furthermore, the crossover point was delayed or shifted to the right in the training group (data for the control group are not shown). This means that the trained children could work harder while using fat as the predominant fuel. Training apparently has the same carbohydrate-sparing benefit for children as for adults.

Fat (2)


A trained individual can use his or her carbohydrate stores more slowly than can an untrained individual because of the changes that occur in fat metabolism. Both trained and untrained individuals have more than adequate stores of fat. However, the rate of free fatty acid oxidation is determined not by the storage amount but by the concentration of free fatty acids in the bloodstream and the capacity of the tissues to oxidize the fat. Training brings about several adaptations in fat metabolism, including the following:



1.
 Increased mobilization or release of free fatty acids from the adipose tissue




2.
 Increased level of plasma free fatty acids during submaximal exercise




3.
 Increased fat storage adjacent to the mitochondria within the muscles




4.
 Increased capacity to utilize fat at any given plasma concentration




The rise in the capacity of the muscle to oxidize lipids is larger than the rise in its capacity to oxidize glycogen. This in conjunction with the lower plasma glucose uptake because of the decreased translocation of the GLUT-4 receptors, leads to the larger contribution of fat to energy production. The increased reliance on fat as a fuel is said to have a
 glycogen-sparing effect
 and is responsible for lowered RER values (

Figure 5.4A

) at the same absolute and same relative (%
 

) work intensities. Because glycogen supplies last longer, fatigue is delayed allowing greater endurance at submaximal work levels. Both endurance and sprint training have glycogen-sparing effects

 (

Abernethy et al., 1990

;
 
Scharhag-Rosenberger et al., 2010

;
 
Stisen et al., 2006

;
 
Talanian et al., 2007

). Although the individuals who were tested in the accompanying Focus on Research box were children, this study illustrates the shift to a greater utilization of fat and lower utilization of carbohydrate at submaximal power outputs and a shift to a higher %
 

 before the crossover point where exercise intensity requires the use of more carbohydrate than fat.



Protein (3)


Although proteins are the least important energy substrate, changes do occur as a result of endurance training that enhance their role in metabolism. Adaptations in protein metabolism include an increased ability to utilize the branched chain amino acid leucine and an increased capacity to form alanine and release it from muscle cells. This increased production of alanine is accompanied by decreased levels in the plasma, probably indicating an accelerated removal for gluconeogenesis. In ultraendurance events, this increased gluconeogenesis effect is beneficial for maintaining blood glucose levels (Abernethy et al., 1990
; Holloszy and Coyle, 1984
; Hood and Terjung, 1990
).


Enzyme Activity


The key to increasing the production of ATP is enzyme activity. Since every step in each metabolic pathway is catalyzed by a separate enzyme, the potential for this training adaptation to influence energy production is great. However, it appears that not all enzymes respond to the same training stimulus nor change to the same extent.


Glycolytic Enzymes (4)


The results of studies on the activity of the glycolytic enzymes have historically been contradictory, but a pattern is emerging. Glycolysis is involved in both the aerobic and anaerobic production of energy, and it may be that high-intensity training is required for some glycolytic enzymes to adapt while others respond better to endurance training. Strength and sprint training appear to increase glycolytic enzyme activity (Mougios, 2006
). These changes are generally less than the activity increases seen in aerobic enzymes, and the functional significance in terms of actual performance remains
 questionable (Ross and Leveritt, 2001
). Three key enzymes have shown significant training changes: glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).


GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen stored in the muscle cells for use as fuel in glycolysis. An increase in this enzyme’s activity has been found with high-intensity sprint training consisting of either short- (<10 seconds) or long- (>10 seconds) sprint intervals (Mougios, 2006
; Ross and Leveritt, 2001
). The ability to break down glycogen quickly is important in near-maximal, maximal, and supramaximal exercises.


Phosphofructokinase PFK is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Results of endurance and sprint training studies are inconsistent but tend to suggest an increase in this enzyme activity with adequate levels of training especially consisting of long-duration sprint repetitions or a combination of long- and short-sprint efforts (Ross and Leveritt, 2001
). Increased PFK activity leads to a faster and greater quantity of ATP being produced glycolytically.


LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE LDH catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate. It exists in several discrete forms, including a cardiac muscle form (LDH 1) that has a low affinity for pyruvate (thus making the formation of lactate less likely) and a skeletal muscle form (LDH 5) that has a high affinity for pyruvate (thus making the formation of lactate more likely). Endurance training tends to have two effects on LDH. It lowers the overall activity of LDH, and it causes a shift from the skeletal muscle to the cardiac muscle form. Thus, lactate is less likely to be produced in the skeletal muscle, and pyruvate is more likely to enter the mitochondria for use as an aerobic fuel. Both of these changes are beneficial to endurance performance (Abernethy et al., 1990
; Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973
; Holloszy and Coyle, 1984
; Sjödin et al., 1982
). Strength and sprint training (consisting of both short- and long-sprint intervals) show opposite effects from endurance training, increasing the overall amount of LDH and favoring the LDH skeletal muscle form because of the changes in fast-twitch muscle hypertrophy (Mougios, 2006
; Ross and Leveritt, 2001
).


Shuttles (5)


The hydrogen ions removed in glycolysis must be transported across the mitochondrial membrane by a shuttle because that membrane is impermeable to NADH + H+
. No training changes have been found in the glycerol-phosphate shuttle enzymes that predominate in the skeletal muscle. Conversely, training leads to large increases in the enzymes of the cardiac muscle’s malate-aspartate shuttle in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, thus increasing shuttle activity. This increase enhances aerobic metabolism in the heart (Holloszy and Coyle, 1984
)
.


Mitochondrial Enzymes (6)


Changes in the mitochondrial enzymes of beta-oxidation, the Krebs cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation are coupled with changes in the mitochondria themselves. Both the size and the number of the mitochondria increase with endurance and high-intensity interval training. In adults, these mitochondrial adaptations of increased density and oxidative enzyme activity, known as mitochondrial biogenesis
, can be on the magnitude of 30–100% within 4–6 weeks of starting training. The extent of the increase in mitochondrial content depends on the initial content. For instance, type IIX (fast twitch, glycolytic) fibers will increase mitochondrial content to a greater amount than type IIA (fast twitch, glycolytic-oxidative) fibers because they have lower mitochondrial content initially (Hood et al., 2012
). As a result of this biogenesis, mitochondria occupy a proportionally larger share of the muscle fiber space. The sarcolemmal mitochondria are affected more than the interfibrillar mitochondria. The stimulus for these increases appears to be a contractile activity itself, rather than any external stimulus such as hormonal changes, since only those muscles directly involved in the exercise training show these changes. For example, runners have an increase in mitochondrial size and number only in the legs, whereas cross-country skiers have mitochondrial increases in both arms and legs.



Within limits, the extent of the augmentation in the mitochondria seems to be a function of the total amount of contractile activity. That is, the more contractions, the greater the change in the mitochondria. It does not seem to matter whether the increase in contractile activity is achieved by completing more contractions per unit of time (speed work) or by keeping the rate of contractions steady but increasing the duration (endurance training). Contractile activity simultaneously brings about an increase in mitochondrial protein levels, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; see the Focus on Application box) and modifies intracellular calcium levels. All three of these results appear to be important mechanisms in bringing about mitochondrial biogenesis. These responses start with the first acute bout of exercise, accumulate with more exercise bouts, and manifest themselves during recovery when the muscle is at rest. This emphasizes the importance of sufficient recovery time (

Hood et al., 2012

).




In general, as noted earlier, the physiological consequence of mitochondrial adaptations in trained distance runners favors a greater reliance on lipid, rather than carbohydrate metabolism. However, when individuals regularly train at high exercise intensity, mitochondrial adaptations seem to favor the CHO pathway over the fatty acid lipid pathway for the highest energy production through improvement in complex I (see
 
Figure 2.10

) rather than complexes II and IV (

Daussin et al., 2008

) of the electron transport system. Resistance training does not appear to enhance mitochondria.




With larger mitochondria, more transport sites are available for the movement of pyruvate into the mitochondria. The enzymatic activity per unit of mitochondria appears to be the same in trained and untrained individuals; however, the greater mitochondrial protein content means an overall greater enzyme activity to utilize the pyruvate that has been transported there. Interestingly, although most mitochondrial enzymes increase in activity, not all do; nor is the rate of change the same for all. The myoglobin concentration in the muscles also increases with endurance training in the muscles directly involved in the activity. As a consequence, the rate of oxygen diffusion through the cytoplasm into the mitochondria increases, making more oxygen available quickly. The overall effect of the increased enzyme activity, more oxygen and the increased availability of pyruvate is an enhanced capacity to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. This augmented capacity is more important for supplying energy for submaximal exercise than for maximal exercise (

Gollnick et al., 1986

Oxygen Utilization (7)


Maximal Oxygen Uptake





 increases with training (

) from both traditional endurance training and high-intensity interval training (

Gist et al., 2014

;
 
Kessler et al., 2012

;
 
Nalcakan, 2014

;
 
Weston et al., 2014

). Even though this is a measure of the amount of oxygen utilized at the muscle level,
 

 is determined more by the cardiovascular system’s ability to deliver oxygen than by the muscle’s ability to use it. Evidence for the subsidiary role of muscle in determining
 

 includes the fact that individuals can have essentially the same mitochondrial content but very different
 

 values. Conversely, individuals with equivalent
 

 values can have quite different mitochondrial enzyme levels. Additionally, small training changes can occur in one factor (mitochondrial activity or
 

) without concomitant changes in the other—although, typically, both will increase. These differences probably explain why some runners are more economical (use less oxygen at a given pace than others do) and others possess a greater aerobic power (have a higher
 

) (

Holloszy and Coyle, 1984

).



Submaximal Oxygen Cost


The oxygen cost (

 in mL·min−1
 or mL·kg−1
·min−1
) of any given absolute submaximal workload is the same before and after the training, assuming that no skill is involved where efficiency would change (Gollnick et al., 1986
; Holloszy and Coyle, 1984
) (Figure 5.4B
). For example, if an individual has a smooth, coordinated front crawl stroke but has not participated in lap swimming, the oxygen cost of covering any given distance at a set pace
 will remain the same as this person trains. However, in an individual who is just learning the front crawl stroke, the oxygen cost could actually go down. It decreases not because of a change in the oxygen requirements but because extraneous inefficient movements that add to the oxygen cost are eliminated as skill is improved (Daniels et al., 1978
; Ekblom et al., 1968
; Gardner et al., 1989
). The practical aspect of this is that applications such as the calculation of energy expenditure during walking, running, and cycling (Arena et al., 2014
), lists of MET levels (Ainsworth et al., 2011
) and caloric costs are deemed to be acceptable for use for adults of both sexes and all ages without regard to fitness level. This may or may not be an accurate assumption.



Running economy (RE) measured as the oxygen cost of running at any given submaximal velocity has been a highly controversial issue in terms of training response. Running economy depends both on the energy needed to move at a particular speed (external energy) and on the energy used to produce that energy (internal energy) and, as explained in
 
Chapter 4

, it represents a complex interplay of physiological and biomechanical factors. Although studies have shown mixed results (

Beneke and Hütler, 2005

), traditionally an improvement in running economy has been seen as a benefit of endurance training such that trained runners have better running economy than do both lesser trained and untrained runners (

Barnes & Kilding, 2015

). Endurance training-induced adaptations such as improved cardiovascular function, increased mitochondria and oxidative enzymes, the ability of the muscles to store and release elastic energy, and optimization of motor recruitment patterns (enhanced neuromuscular characteristics) may all be related to improvements in running economy. Highly trained runners display more refined patterns of muscle recruitment than do lesser trained or untrained runners. In essence, they have become more physiologically capable and more skilled (

Bonacci et al., 2009

;
 
Burgess and Lambert, 2010

;
 
Saunders et al., 2004

). However, there is no sure-fire way for improving running economy. A number of factors have been investigated to try and improve economy. High-intensity interval training has produced improvements in running economy, but the evidence is not strong (

Barnes and Kilding, 2015

;
 
Gunnarsson et al., 2012

;
 
McCann and Higginson, 2008

). Some studies suggest that economy may be improved by the addition of resistance training to the normal aerobic endurance regime of runners and cross-country skiers. Traditional weight training, movement-specific resistance training, and plyometric training have been shown to be effective (

Barnes and Kilding, 2015

). Results from stretching and flexibility studies are equivocal. An acute bout of stretching may improve running economy, but regular stretching over time appears to have no effect on economy (

Barnes and Kilding, 2015

). Again, it has been speculated that a combination of improved running mechanics and neuromuscular function results in a decreased oxygen consumption, but many questions remain unanswered (

Bonacci et al., 2009

;
 
Millet et al., 2002

;
 
Saunders et al., 2006

;
 
Spurrs et al., 2003

;
 
Turner et al., 2003

).




If an individual increases his or her
 

 and yet the oxygen cost of any given (absolute) workload remains the same, then the %
 

 at which that individual is doing the given workload will go down. The task will be relatively easier for the individual, and endurance performance will be greatly enhanced.




Decreased efficiency or economy can also occur. If so, it should be interpreted as a symptom of overtraining (

Fry et al., 1991

).



Oxygen Deficit and Drift


The oxygen deficit at the onset of activity is smaller, but is not eliminated, in trained individuals. The primary reason for this reduction is that oxidative phosphorylation is activated sooner because of the greater number of mitochondria that are sensitive to low levels of ADP and Pi
. This result is advantageous to the exerciser because less lactic acid/lactate is produced and less creatine phosphate depleted (Holloszy, 1973
; Holloszy and Coyle, 1984
; Krustrup et al., 2004
).



The magnitude of oxygen drift is also less after training. This change may be caused by concomitant reductions in epinephrine, norepinephrine, lactate, and body temperature rise during any given submaximal workload (

Casaburi et al., 1987

;
 
Hagberg et al., 1978

).



Excess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption


Excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) is a function of the intensity and duration of the previous exercise bout. Aerobic endurance training has been shown (Sedlock et al., 2010
) to significantly decrease the magnitude of EPOC after exercise at the same absolute submaximal intensity but to result in no change after exercise of the same relative submaximal intensity. This is because the same (pretraining) absolute intensity is a lower relative intensity after training. The mechanisms appear to be the same as for the changes in oxygen drift. These factors include training-induced decreases in blood lactate concentration, body temperature, epinephrine-mediated glucose production, and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The training-induced shift toward greater fat utilization during exercise continues into the postexercise period.


Lactate Accumulation (8)


Lactic acid/lactate is produced when the hydrogen atoms carried on NADH + H+
 are transferred to pyruvic acid in a reaction catalyzed by lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate accumulates when the rate of production exceeds the rate of removal. Endurance exercise training increases the capacities for both lactate production and lactate removal. It also increases lactate clearance rate for both absolute and relative workloads (Messonnier et al., 2013
). Although the capacity for production is higher, this does not mean that capacity is reached at all workloads. Indeed, training results in lower lactate production at any given absolute workload and as such less lactate is accumulated in a trained individual than in an untrained individual
.



Factors that lead to a decrease in lactic acid/lactate production following training include:




1.
 Fuel shifts




2.
 Enzyme activity changes




3.
 Blunted neurohormonal responses




Pyruvate is the end product of carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis). Less carbohydrate is utilized at an absolute submaximal workload after training; therefore, less pyruvate is available for conversion into lactate. At the same time, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increases following training, causing more pyruvate to be converted to acetyl CoA. LDH enzyme shifts from the skeletal muscle form, which favors lactate production, to the cardiac muscle form, which has a lower affinity for pyruvate. In addition, following training, glycolysis is inhibited by several factors, two of which relate to the increased utilization of fat during submaximal exercise. The first is a high concentration of free fatty acid in the cytoplasm; the second is a high level of citrate (the first product in the Krebs cycle). Both factors cause the rate-limiting enzyme PFK to slow down glycolysis and thus decrease the possible production of lactate. Finally, a smaller increase in the concentration of epinephrine and norepinephrine has been found at the same absolute and relative workloads in trained individuals. This decreased sympathetic stimulation may also decrease the activation of glycogenolysis and the potential production of lactate (

Gollnick et al., 1986

;
 
Holloszy and Coyle, 1984

;
 
Messonnier et al., 2006

).







FOCUS ON APPLICATION






Oxygen-Free Radicals, Exercise, Exercise Training Adaptations, and Antioxidant Supplements






Cancer, atherosclerosis, cataracts, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, loss of memory, Parkinson’s disease, and aging may all, in part, be caused by free radical damage (Keith, 1999
). What are free radicals? How can they cause so many different problems? What is the link between oxygen-free radicals, exercise, and exercise training adaptations? Should antioxidant supplements be taken by individuals involved in exercise training?







Under normal conditions, electrons orbiting in the shells of a molecule are in pairs. If a single electron is added or removed, instability occurs. The resulting structure is called a
 free radical
. Free radicals have a drive to return to a balanced stable state and attempt to do so by taking an electron from, giving an electron to, or sharing an electron with another atom.
 Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
 contain free radicals and reactive forms of oxygen.








ROS can be produced from sources originating outside the body, such as x-rays, UV rays in sunlight, altitude, air pollutants (ozone and nitric oxide in car exhaust), cigarette smoke, toxic chemicals (some pesticides), and physical injury (from contact sports or concussions). They may also result from sources within the body, specifically as part of normal immune function or as a normal by-product of the production of energy (

Finaud et al., 2006

;
 
Keith, 1999

).








Acute exercise produces free radicals. Production can occur at various sites in muscle cells: the mitochondrion, sarcoplasmic reticulum, transverse tubules, and cytosol. Surprisingly, mitochondria from fast twitch type II muscle fibers promote higher levels of ROS production than do those from slow twitch (type I) fibers. Mitochondrial-derived ROS are produced when electrons traveling through the electron transport chain of Stage IV are leaked at complexes I and III. The higher the rate of metabolism (as in moving from rest to submaximal to maximal exercise), the more free radicals are produced. Approximately 0.2–0.8% of the oxygen consumed is converted to free radicals (

Hood et al., 2012

;
 
Powers et al., 2011

). Anaerobic energy production provides an abundance of hydrogen ions that can react with an oxygen-free radical to form an ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide, H
2
O
2
. Hypoxia leads to freeing of metals (Fe, Cu, and Mg) that are needed to catalyze free radical production. Exercise-induced hyperthermia may trigger free radical proliferation. Any damage to muscle fibers leads to increased immune response and free radical production (

Finaud et al., 2006

). Exercises that result in alterations of blood flow and oxygen supply such as weight lifting trigger free radical production.








ROS have numerous negative effects. If the production of free radicals is continuous and high and exceeds that of components called
 antioxidants
 that suppress them and their harmful effects,
 oxidative stress
 occurs. Often, a chain reaction occurs that results in damage to lipids (especially the lipid bilayer of cell membranes), proteins (in enzymes, immune cells, joints, and muscles), DNA (breaking strands or shifting bases, thus influencing the genetic code), and, in excess, decreases muscular contractile force or even cellular death. These changes ultimately can lead minimally to muscular fatigue or more seriously to the diseases listed earlier (

Alessio and Blasi, 1997

;
 
Finaud et al., 2006

;
 
Gross et al., 2011

;
 
Hood et al., 2012

;
 
Jenkins, 1993

;
 
Keith, 1999

).








Conversely, ROS have several positive roles in the body including involvement in the immune system, cellular signaling, enzyme activation, facilitation of glycogen replenishment, and muscle fiber contractile force. A single acute bout of exercise that produces a small increase in ROS plays an essential role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways that ultimately lead to muscular adaptation (

Powers et al., 2011

). Among the cellular signaling done by ROS after aerobic endurance training are the pathways that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, capillarization, muscle and heart hypertrophy, and glucose transport ability. They can act as a vasodilator and optimize both blood flow and the velocity of blood flow (

Gross et al., 2011

).








Despite the increased production of free radicals resulting from exercise, it is unlikely that exercise results in substantial damages to a normal healthy individual. The body

 has a number of natural (endogenous) defenses, and antioxidants ingested in food provide additional (exogenous) defenses. Each cell contains a variety of antioxidant scavenger enzymes, predominantly superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals include vitamin E, vitamin C, beta carotene (precursor of vitamin A), selenium, coenzyme Q (ubiquinone), and flavonoids.








The relationship between exercise and oxidative stress appears to be an inverted U, based on intensity and total volume. That is, there are no benefits with a sedentary lifestyle. Single acute bouts of light to moderate and strenuous physical activity both have been shown to selectively enhance the antioxidant enzymes along with ROS. However, while light to moderate activity reduces oxidative stress, strenuous exercise increases oxidative stress. If too much strenuous exercise results in overtraining, the benefits of appropriate training (decreased ROS, increased antioxidants, increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, decreased oxidative damage, increased oxidative damage repair, and increased resistance to oxidative stress) are reversed and instead of the exercise protecting against oxidative stress and being beneficial to health, the resistance is decreased (

Pingitore et al., 2015

).








Most exercise training studies have shown increased antioxidant levels following both aerobic endurance exercise and dynamic resistance exercise. Part of the training adaptation may be due to increases in the cytochromes in electron transport, which reduces electron leakage (

Alessio and Blasi, 1997

;
 
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, 2009

;
 
Powers et al., 2014

).








Recent consensus reports (

ACSM et al., 2009

;
 
Kreider et al., 2004

;
 
Pendergast et al., 2011

;
 
Pingitore et al., 2015

) do not support the idea that ingested supplementation of vitamins A, C, or E improve performance, delay fatigue, or protect against muscle damage in adequately nourished individuals. Indeed, several recent exercise studies have provided evidence that high supplementation of antioxidants may actually be counterproductive both acutely and in terms of blunted training adaptations (

Peternelj and Coombes, 2011

;
 
Powers et al., 2011

). Acute exercise responses to antioxidant supplementation indicate that the elevated oxidative defenses via the normal upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes may be suppressed. For example,
 
Knez et al. (2007)

 reported significantly greater oxidative damage in half and full ironman triathletes who took antioxidant supplements than in those who did not. Chronic training adaptations with antioxidant supplementation include evidence of suppressed capillarization and mitochondrial biogenesis (

Gross et al., 2011

).








However, this is not to say that all antioxidant supplementation should be avoided. Individual athletes and circumstances must be taken into account. Athletes at greatest risk for poor antioxidant intakes include those doing high-intensity training, following a low-fat diet, restricting energy intake, or limiting dietary intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. In addition, athletes training at high altitude (where free radical production is intensified and internal defenses are weakened by hypoxia) could benefit from supplementation. All individuals should make sure that their diets contain large amounts of antioxidant-rich foods, primarily fruits and vegetables. Prunes, raisins, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, spinach, broccoli, beets, onions, corn, eggplant, nuts, and whole grains are particularly beneficial. If vitamin supplements are ingested they should not exceed recommended upper limits such as 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily or 400 IU per day for vitamin E. More is not better, and in excessive amounts, antioxidants can actually act as pro-oxidants with potential negative effects. Supplementation with coenzyme Q is not recommended at all. The search for the optimal balance between the beneficial and harmful effects of ROS and antioxidant supplementation continues (

Several other changes lead to higher removal and rate of clearance in trained individuals. These can be classified into two main factors:




1.
 Enhanced lactate transport




2.
 Enhanced lactate oxidation




Lactate transport is enhanced by a combination of increased substrate affinity (the ability of the lactate to bind to the transporter), increased intrinsic activity of the enzymes involved, and increased density of the mitochondrial membrane and cell membrane lactate transporters (

Juel et al., 2004

;
 
Thomas et al., 2005

). Although some

 studies have reported increases in both MCT1 and MCT4 transporters, it appears to be MCT1 that primarily changes with training. These changes have been seen after endurance, strength, all-out sprint, and interval training (

Brooks et al., 2008

;
 
Gunnarson et al., 2012

;
 
Thomas et al., 2012

). At the same time, mitochondrial size, number, and enzyme concentrations are increased. Taken together, these changes enable muscle cells to increase both the extracellular and intracellular lactate shuttle mechanisms. There is an overall uptake of lactate by muscles, and as a result, more lactate can be oxidized more rapidly during exercise. Concomitantly, blood flow to the liver is enhanced, which aids in overall lactate removal (

Bonen, 2000

;
 
Brooks, 2000

;
 
Brooks et al., 2000

;
 
Gladden, 2000

;
 
Pilegaard et al., 1994

). Training at the velocity of maximal lactate steady-state (MLSSv) has been shown to increase both time to exhaustion at MLSSv and
 

 without modifying either [La
−
] or reliance on carbohydrate fuel indicating an increased lactate clearance (

Billat et al., 2004

). The result is a decreased concentration of lactate in the muscles and blood at the same relative workload (


) after training.




As a consequence of the decrease in production and increase in removal after training, a higher workload (both in absolute and relative terms) is required to reach lactate levels in the 2- to 4-mmol·L
−1
 range (

Figure 5.4C

). This means that an individual can exercise at a higher relative intensity for a given period of time and yet delay the onset of fatigue because the lactate thresholds (LT1 and LT2) have been raised (

Allen et al., 1985

;
 
Henritze et al., 1985

;
 
Holloszy and Coyle, 1984

;
 
Londeree, 1997

;
 
Skinner and Morgan, 1985

;
 
Williams et al., 1967

;
 
Yoshida et al., 1982

). There appears to be a dose-response relationship between the frequency of interval training and the magnitude of lactate threshold improvement (expressed as %
 

) (

Dalleck et al., 2010

). At maximal aerobic/anaerobic endurance exercise, the level of lactate accumulation is higher as a result of training. The higher level probably results from the greater glycogen stores and increased activity of some of the glycolytic enzymes other than LDH (

Abernethy et al., 1990

;
 
Gollnick et al., 1986

). It may also be more a psychological than a physiological adaptation, in that the trained individual is more motivated and can better tolerate the pain caused by lactic acid (

Galbo, 1983

) when working at a higher absolute load.




Resistance training has been shown to affect lactate response to both weight-lifting exercise and dynamic aerobic exercise. That is, after resistance training, more work can be done before achieving the same accumulation of lactate that occurred before training; less lactate is accumulated at the same absolute workload; and at the same relative workload, the accumulation of lactate is unchanged. (

Greco et al., 2011

;
 
Marcinik et al., 1991

;
 
Reynolds et al., 1997; Yamamoto et al., 2008

).



ATP Production, Storage, and Turnover


ATP-PC (9)


Although exercise training increases the potential for the production of larger quantities of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, it does not change the efficiency of converting fuel to ATP or ATP to work. Thirty-two actual ATP molecules are still produced from glucose in skeletal muscle, and the potential energy per mole of ATP is still between 7 and 12 kcal (Abernethy et al., 1990
; Gollnick and Hermansen, 1973
; Gollnick et al., 1986
; Holloszy, 1973
; Karlsson et al., 1972
; Skinner and Morgan, 1985
).



However, the amount of ATP and PC stored in the resting muscle is higher in trained than in untrained individuals, especially if muscle mass increases. Whether this amount is large enough to markedly increase anaerobic capacity is questionable. The resting PC/ATP ratio does not differ among sprint-trained runners, endurance-trained runners, and untrained individuals (

 Johansen and Quistorff, 2003

). At the same absolute workload, there is less depletion of the PC and degradation of ATP levels after training. At the same relative workload, PC depletion and ATP degradation do not change with training. However, the activity of the enzymes responsible for the breakdown of ATP to ADP and the regeneration of ADP and ATP increase. Therefore, the rate of turnover of ATP and PC increases and may be as much as double that of untrained individuals in both sprint- and endurance-trained runners (

 Johansen and Quistorff, 2003

). Taken together, the ATP-PC-LA changes indicate an increased anaerobic power and capacity with sprint-type training (

Medbø and Burgers, 1990

). Values for the ATP-PC, LA, and O
2
 systems are presented in
 
Table 5.3

. The values for the untrained were previously presented in (

Table 3.1

 but are now contrasted with trained males. The LA system changes much more with training than does the ATP-PC system, but the greatest change is in the O
2
 system (

Bouchard et al., 1982

,
 
1991

).

Work (Power) Outpu
t


Work (power) output—measured as watts or kilocalories per kilogram of body weight on a bicycle test such as the 10- or 30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test and/or a 90-second test—improves with training. This is evidenced by higher scores of athletes than nonathletes and by higher posttraining than pretraining scores in all populations. Furthermore, sprint- or power-type athletes typically have higher anaerobic values and greater adaptations than do endurance-type athletes. Elite sprinters and power athletes score higher than do less successful competitors (Bar-Or, 1987
; Beld et al., 1989
; Horswill et al., 1989
; Patton and Duggan, 1987
).



Aerobically, a trained individual can continue any given submaximal workload longer than can an untrained individual. The trained individual can also accomplish more total work and a higher absolute maximum than can an untrained individual. Overall, the trained individual has a metabolic system capable of supporting enhanced performance, both at submaximal and at maximal levels. These changes, summarized in
 
Table 5.4

, depend on the type of training used.Complete the Check Your Comprehension 3—Case Study 1 box to test your knowledge of metabolic training adaptations.

The Influence of Age and Sex on Metabolic Training Adaptations




With the exception of 

, there are few research data on most of the metabolic variables across the age spectrum. The scattered evidence that is available indicates that training and detraining changes in children, adolescents, and older adults are similar in direction and magnitude to changes in adults in the 20- to 50-year range. This is especially true when changes are considered relative to baseline values (i.e., as a percentage of change) rather than as absolutes (Adeniran and Toriola, 1988
; Bar-Or, 1983
; Clarke, 1977
; Eriksson, 1972
; Gaisl and Wiesspeiner, 1986
; Massicotte and MacNab, 1974
; McNarry and Jones, 2014
; Rotstein et al., 1986
; Rowland, 1990
).



The one remarkable exception to the this generalization is the uncoupling of endurance performance changes and
 

 changes in youth such that children exhibit a limited capacity to improve
 

; despite being able to improve endurance exercise performance. That is, the same exercise training program that would generate a 15–20% improvement in adults in
 

 typically results in only a 5% increase in prepubertal children of both sexes. The question, of course, is why. There does not appear to be a “maturational threshold” or “trigger point” that coincides with puberty and its associated hormonal changes that is responsible for the improvements in VO
2
max (

Armstrong, 2015

;
 
McNarry and Jones, 2014

).





Rowland (2009)

 has proposed the
 crowded cell hypothesis.
 In the skeletal muscle cell, there is only so much space and that space is shared by the contractile apparatus, the sarcoplasmic reticulum that regulates each contraction-relaxation cycle, and the mitochondria that provides the energy. Adaptations of cellular elements to training are limited by cell space. The space allocated to the contractile apparatus and sarcoplasmic reticulum cannot be compromised. Children have less space for expansion than do adults because before training their muscle fibers have a higher mitochondrial density (~+30–50%) and oxidative enzyme activity than do adults. The limited change in mitochondria results in
 

 increases with endurance training that are typically a lower percentage in children than adults. Further research is needed to confirm or modify this hypothesis.




There is also minimal data on metabolic adaptations in females of all ages, again with the exception of
 

 (

Shepard, 1978

;
 
Tlusty, 1969

;
 
Wells, 1991

). From the available studies, it appears that males and females respond to the same training with the same adaptations (

Johnson et al., 2010

;
 
Slade et al., 2002

;
 
Wells, 1991

;
 
Weltman et al., 1978

). Sex differences in the metabolic variables are not obliterated in equally trained males and females, but both sexes are trainable and probably to the same extent.





Detraining in the Metabolic System




Detraining is the partial or complete loss of training-induced anatomical, physiological, and performance adaptations in response to an insufficient training stimulus
 (Mujika and Padilla, 2000a
). If an individual ceases training or reduces training beyond that of a planned taper, detraining or reversibility will occur. This reversibility of training adaptations in metabolic potential occurs within days to weeks after training ceases. A reduction in both maximal and submaximal performance ultimately follows. Those metabolic factors that improve the most with training, that is, those involved with aerobic energy production, also show the greatest reversal. Within 3–6 weeks after the cessation of training, the individual typically returns to pretraining levels, especially if the training program was of short duration. Individuals with a long and established training history, however, tend to have an initial rapid decline in some aerobic variables but then level off at higher-than-pretraining levels. Anaerobic metabolic variables have less incremental increase with training and less loss with detraining. This fact may explain why sprint performance is more resistant to
 inactivity than is endurance performance. Complete bed rest or immobilization accelerates detraining (Coyle et al., 1984
; Neufer, 1989
; Ready and Quinney, 1982
; Wilmore and Costill, 1988
).



The following specific detraining effects have been documented in detraining studies (

Mujika and Padilla, 2000a

,

b

,
 
2001

):




1.
 Fuel supply:




a.
 Both short-term (<4 weeks) and long-term (>4 weeks) detraining are characterized by an increased RER during submaximal exercise, indicating a shift toward an increased reliance on carbohydrates as an energy substrate and a decreased reliance on lipid metabolism.




b.
 A reduced (17–33% in 6–10 days) muscle GLUT-4 transporter content occurs with detraining. Possibly as a result, insulin-mediated glucose update also decreases rapidly with detraining. Accompanying this is an increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine during submaximal exercise.




c.
 Decreases in intracellular glycogen storage have also been reported with as little as 1 week of detraining. Reductions of approximately 20% have been reported in 4 weeks in highly trained athletes, and the level may completely revert to the pretraining level shortly after that.




2.
 Enzyme activity:




a.
 Oxidative enzyme activity decreases between 25% and 45% with both short-term and long-term

 detraining in highly conditioned individuals and after short-term training programs.




b.
 Small, nonsystematic changes in glycolytic enzymes may occur.




3.
 O
2
 utilization:




 has been reported to decline 4–14% with short-term (<4 weeks) detraining and 6–20% with long-term detraining (>4 weeks). The decline in trained individuals tends to be progressive and directly proportional to the
 

 during the first 8 weeks and then to stabilize at levels higher or equal to that of sedentary individuals. Recently trained individuals may decline a lesser amount in the initial weeks, but with long-term detraining, they tend to revert to pretraining levels.




4.
 Lactate accumulation:




a.
 Increased blood lactate levels during submaximal exercise occur in both the short and the long term with detraining.




b.
 Detraining leads to a decrease in maximal lactate values.




c.
 LT1 and LT2 occur at a lower percentage of
 

 with detraining.




5.
 ATP production, storage, and transport:




a.
 Mitochondrial ATP production rate decreases 12–28% during 3 weeks of detraining after 6 weeks of training in previously sedentary individuals but still remains above pretraining levels.




Retraining does not occur as rapidly as detraining and is not easier or more rapid than the initial training (

Wilmore and Costill, 1988

). Although direct experimental evidence is scanty, the consequences of detraining and retraining appear to be similar for adults, children, and adolescents of both sexes (

Bar-Or, 1983

). These results indicate how fine the line is between allowing for adequate rest and recovery during the transition phase of periodization to prevent overuse injuries and overtraining and too much down time that results in measurable detraining (

Melchiorri et al., 2014

;
 
Ormsbee & Arciero, 2012

).







FOCUS ON RESEARCH






Detraining and Retraining






This case study of detraining and retraining was conducted on a 49.5-year-old female elite competitive cyclist. Two days after undergoing testing for a research project, the cyclist sustained a right clavicular fracture during a criterion race. She continued a modified training regime until 22 days after the injury, when she developed loss of motion in the shoulder and pain and numbness in the hand. Surgery was performed 26 days after the injury for brachial plexus impingement. Thus, the detraining period began approximately 4 weeks after the injury. Retraining began the 32nd day after surgery (0 on the X
-axis). Results for her metabolic variables are presented in the accompanying graphs. The baseline represents the values obtained 2 days before the injury. Retesting was done approximately every 2 weeks (0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 days) for 6 weeks and then again at week 11 of retraining (77 days).









 decreased approximately 25% during detraining, but by week 11, it was within 2 mL·kg·min
−1
 of preinjury values. The improvement was steady over the first 6 weeks of retraining.








Power output decreased 18.2% at peak, 16.7% at LT1, and 18.9% at 4 mM lactate. Peak lactate decreased by a comparable 19.1%. Although peak power output increased during the first 2 weeks, power output at LT1 and 4 mM lactate did not. This probably occurred because high-intensity work was not included in the initial retraining weeks as is appropriate given the progression principle. By week 11, peak power output and power output at LT1 had returned to baseline values. However, at that point neither peak power output at 4 mM nor peak lactate had regained preinjury levels.

SUMMARY





1.
 The most important considerations for applying each training principle to achieve metabolic adaptations are as follows:




a.
 For specificity, match the energy system of the activity.




b.
 For overload, manipulate time and distance or lactate level.




c.
 For rest/recovery/adaptation, alternate hard and easy days.




d. For progression, re-overload if additional improvement is desired.




e. For individualization, evaluate the individual according to the demands of the activity and develop a periodization training sequence, system, and load on the basis of this evaluation.




f. For maintenance, emphasize intensity.




g. For retrogression, plateau, and reversibility, evaluate the training adaptations and modify as indicated.




h. For warm-up and cooldown, include activities that will actually elevate and reduce body temperature, respectively.




2.
 Properly prescribed training programs bring about positive adaptations in fuel supply, enzyme activity, oxygen utilization, lactate accumulation, and ATP production, storage, and turnover.




3.
 Available evidence indicated that training and detraining changes in children, adolescents, and older individuals are similar in direction and magnitude to those in young-middle-aged adults with the possible exception of
 

.




4.
 Both males and females respond to training with the same adaptations, but these do not obliterate the relative differences between the sexes.




5.
 Detraining brings about a reversal of training adaptations in days to weeks for the metabolic variables. Retraining does not occur as rapidly as does detraining and is not easier or more rapid than initial training.
