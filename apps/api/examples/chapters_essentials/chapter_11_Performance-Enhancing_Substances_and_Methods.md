e

provide reliable and up-to-date information
to athletes on the risks and benefits of
performance-enhancing substances,
including anabolic steroids;

understand the efficacy and adverse effects
of over-the-counter dietary supplements
marketed to athletes for enhancing sport
and exercise performance;
determine which performance-enhancing
supplements are beneficial for strength/
power performance, endurance
performance, or both; and
distinguish between those performanceenhancing supplements that mimic the
effects of hormones in the body and those
that improve performance through some
other means.

The author would like to acknowledge the significant contributions
of Jay R. Hoffman and Jeffrey R. Stout to this chapter.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Athletes who choose to use performance-enhancing substances do so with the hope that they will augment their
training adaptations and ultimately improve their sport
performance (198). Ideally, performance-enhancing
substances also support the health of the athlete and are
within the ethical and stated guidelines of the athlete’s
sport. Because of the ethical considerations relating to
unfair advantage during competition and the potential
for adverse events, most athletic governing bodies have
generated a list of substances that are banned from
national and international competition. Athletes caught
using such substances can be suspended or forced to
forfeit their medals or both. In situations in which the
athlete tests positive for a banned substance on repeated
occasions, he or she risks a lifetime ban on participation in the given sport. However, numerous nutritional
supplements and ergogenic aids are permissible and are
frequently used by athletes to maximize performance
enhancement. Often the use of these substances is promoted on the basis of unfounded claims (198). Thus, it
is imperative that the athlete become informed about
the legality of these substances, understand the potential
risks associated with consumption, and know whether
scientific research supports the claims (i.e., the efficacy
of the product). The strength and conditioning professional can greatly assist athletes in this regard by giving
them relevant information related to these issues, as well

as by referring them to nutrition specialists. Although
an ergogenic aid can be any substance, mechanical aid,
or training method that improves sport performance, for
the purposes of this chapter the term refers specifically
to pharmacologic aids.
Athletes may try to gain a competitive advantage
by using supplements that are reputed to be ergogenic
but are not banned, or they may knowingly use banned
substances in the belief that they can stay ahead of the
drug testers (198). A consequence may be that athletes
who would normally refrain from using these substances
may feel pressured to use them just to stay abreast of their
competitors. However, athletes who are well informed
can confidently ignore useless and possibly harmful
products despite what their fellow athletes claim. It may
also be possible to steer athletes away from the use of
banned drugs if they are aware of the risks to their health
and safety and are aware that competitors who cheat run
a high risk of being detected.
Athletes should focus on using appropriately periodized strength and conditioning methods and sound
nutritional practices designed to enhance performance. If
these two factors are addressed, at that point the athlete
can consider using sport supplements or ergogenic aids.
It is important that athletes seek guidance from appropriate professionals in order to make sure that what they
are considering is both legal and efficacious.

An athlete’s first priority should be to apply
sound principles of training, including
adequate nutrition, before using any nutritional supplement or ergogenic aid. Before
purchasing or consuming a product, an
athlete should seek guidance from qualified
professionals to make sure the choice is both
legal and effective.

Types of Performance-Enhancing
Substances
This chapter discusses two categories of performance-enhancing substances: (1) hormones and the
drugs that mimic their effects and (2) dietary supplements. Certain hormones, such as testosterone, play an
integral role in the adaptive response to strength and
conditioning activities; others, such as epinephrine,
are important for energy mobilization during training.
These and several other types of hormones are covered
more extensively in the next part of this chapter. The
distinction between a drug and a dietary supplement is
not intuitively obvious. For example, caffeine, which is

found in many beverages such as coffee, is categorized
as a drug. The distinction between a drug and a dietary
supplement affects whether or not a product meets
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval for safety and effectiveness. If a product is not
classified as a drug or advertised as having therapeutic
value, FDA regulations concerning its sale are relatively
relaxed. This means that any manufacturer can introduce
anew dietary supplement to the market without special
approval and that the FDA will not investigate its safety
or effectiveness unless a health risk is brought to the
agency’s attention (87). The FDA’s definition ofa drug
encompasses substances that change the body’s structure or function. This includes substances that stimulate
hormone secretion. In addition, if a compound is administered differently from the way in which foods would
be consumed, it may be classified as a drug.
The distinction between a drug and a dietary
supplement is linked to FDA approval for
safety and effectiveness.

Generally, dietary supplements are highly refined
products that would not be confused with a food. They
may not have any positive nutritional value; hence they
are not referred to as nutritional supplements. Carbohydrate loading to bolster glycogen stores before an
athletic competition is considered sport nutrition, as is a
tablet of a single purified amino acid (not promoted for
medicinal properties); however, the tablet is considered

a dietary supplement.


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Methods

Definition of Products That Can Be Sold as Dietary Supplements
The following points define which products can be sold as dietary supplements in the United States:
1. A product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the
following dietary ingredients:
a. A vitamin
b . A mineral
C . An herb or other botanical
d. An amino acid
e . Adietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake
i A concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient identified in a
through e
2. The product must also be intended for ingestion and cannot be advertised for use as a conventional
food or as the sole item within a meal or diet.

The FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement
products and dietary ingredients. The FDA regulates
dietary supplements under a different set of regulations
than those covering conventional foods and drugs (see
FDA website at www.fda.gov/Food/Dietarysupplements/default.htm). In 1994, the U.S. Congress passed
a seminal piece of legislation known as the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). Under
DSHEA, manufacturers and distributors of dietary
supplements are prohibited from marketing products
that are adulterated or misbranded. This means that
these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and
labeling of their products before marketing to ensure
that they meet all the requirements of DSHEA and FDA
regulations. Companies

can, however, make claims

about effects on the body’s structure and function as
long as the manufacturers can show that the statements
are truthful and not misleading; this is a much less
stringent requirement than for effectiveness clainis
made for drugs.
Ergogenic substances are usually banned from athletic
competition when a consensus 1s reached that they may
provide an unfair competitive edge or pose a significant
health risk. This prohibition does not need to be based

on conclusive proof that a substance does anything
advantageous; it simply represents an agreement among
administrators or clinicians that this may be the case.
As mentioned previously, every sport’s governing body
publishes its own list of banned substances. Probably
the most widely recognized international organization
regulating doping worldwide is the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA), which oversees the doping controls
and establishes the banned substances list for the International Olympic Committee (69). Each country has
an affiliated agency (e.g., United States Anti-Doping
Agency [USADA], Australian Anti-Doping Agency
[ASADA]). ASADA not only polices doping in Olympic
sports but also oversees doping controls for professional
sports in Australia. The prohibited substances list is
standardized and updated by WADA each year. While
the WADA list is the international standard, other organizations, such as collegiate and professional sports in
the United States, have different prohibited substances
lists as well as penalties for doping. Regardless of which
organization regulates doping controls, it is incumbent
upon the athlete, sport coach, strength and conditioning
professional, and all support staff to ensure that they are
compliant with their respective organizations. Figure 11.1

lists the 2013-2014 National Collegiate Athletic Association banned drug classes. This list is used by many
universities in the United States and is subject to change
on a yearly basis.
Some of the substances are illegal under governmental statute as well. Anabolic steroids are a Class III
substance, which makes their possession, for other than
medical use, punishable with a maximum penalty of one
year in prison and a minimum US$1,000 fine if this is
the individual’s first drug offense. The maximum penalty
for trafficking (to deal or trade in something illegal) is

five years in prison and a fine of US$250,000 ifthis is
the individual’s first felony drug offense. If this is the
second felony drug offense, the maximum period of
imprisonment and the maximum fine both double. While
these penalties are for federal offenses, individual states
have also implemented fines and penalties for illegal use
of anabolic steroids.

Hormones
A variety of endogenously produced hormones are used
to enhance athletic performance. The most commonly
used hormone is testosterone, along with its synthetic
derivatives (121). Testosterone is the primary androgen
hormone that interacts with skeletal muscle tissue. In
addition to testosterone, a variety of other hormones
produced by the body have been employed by athletes
as ergogenic aids to stimulate the testes to produce
testosterone, or they have anabolic properties in themselves; growth hormone is an example. Erythropoietin,
which is secreted by the kidneys, is used to stimulate red
cell production for enhancement of aerobic endurance
performance; and catecholamines such as adrenaline (or
epinephrine), which have metabolic and nervous system
effects, are often used to enhance weight loss and to
provide greater arousal for performance.


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Methods

Anabolic Steroids
Anabolic steroids are the synthetic (human-made)
derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone. Physiologically, elevations in testosterone concentrations
stimulate protein synthesis, resulting in improvements
in muscle size, body mass, and strength (27). In addition,
testosterone and its synthetic derivatives are responsible
for the development and maturation of male secondary
sex characteristics (i.e., increase in body hair; masculine voice; development of male pattern baldness,
libido, sperm production, and aggressiveness). These
androgenic properties include the full development of
the primary sexual characteristics of the male. Thus it is
more accurate to refer to synthetic derivatives of testosterone as anabolic-androgenic steroids. However, they
are also referred to as androgens, androgenic steroids,
or anabolic steroids.
Secretion of testosterone occurs primarily in the interstitial Leydig cells in the testes. Although several other
steroid hormones with anabolic-androgenic properties
are produced in the testes (e.g., dihydrotestosterone
and androstenedione), testosterone is produced in far
greater quantities. Testosterone and these other male
sex hormones are also secreted in significantly smaller
amounts from the adrenal glands (in men and women)
and ovaries (in women). Many of the ergogenic aids on
the market today are precursors for testosterone (1.e.,
androstenedione) and are discussed in more detail later
in this chapter.
It was not until the 1930s that testosterone was isolated, synthesized, and subsequently investigated for its
effects in humans (61). The physiological changes that
testosterone regulates have made it one of the drugs of
choice for strength and power athletes or other athletes
interested in increasing muscle mass (121). However,
testosterone itself is a very poor ergogenic aid. Rapid
degradation occurs when testosterone is given either
orally or through injectable administration (256). Thus,
chemical modification of testosterone was necessary
to retard the degradation process in order to achieve
androgenic and anabolic effects at lower concentrations
and to provide effective blood concentrations for longer
periods of time (256). Many derivatives of testosterone
were developed from 1940 to 1960 (207); once these
modifications occurred, anabolic steroid use through
either oral or injectable administration became possible. In recent years, anabolic steroid administration
via creams and gels for topical applications and skin
patches has increased in popularity, primarily for medical
reasons. However, the most commonly used forms for
administration in athletes are oral and injectable forms
(121). Examples oforal and injectable anabolic steroids
are listed in table 11.1.

Dosing
Athletes typically use anabolic steroids in a “stacking”
regimen, in which they administer several different
diugs simultaneously (187). The rationale for stacking
is to increase the potency of each drug via an additive
effect. That is, the potency of one anabolic agent may
be enhanced when it is consumed simultaneously with
another anabolic agent. Research in this area is limited,
and the efficacy of stacking has not been proven one
way or the other. Individuals use both oral and injectable
compounds. Most users take anabolic steroids in a cyclic
pattern, meaning they use the drugs for several weeks or
months and alternate these cycles with periods of discontinued use (187). Often users administer the drugs in a
pyramid (step-up) pattern in which dosages are steadily
increased over several weeks (121). Toward the end of
the cycle, the athlete “steps down” to reduce the likelihood of negative side effects. At this point, some athletes

discontinue the drug use or perhaps initiate another
cycle of different drugs (e.g., drugs that may increase
endogenous testosterone production, taken to prevent
the undesirable drop in testosterone concentrations that
follows the removal of the pharmaceutical agents). One
study showed that the typical steroid regimen involved
an average of 3.1 agents, with a typical cycle ranging




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

from 5 to 10 weeks (187). The dose that the athlete
administered was reported to vary from between 5 and
29 times greater than physiological replacement doses
(187). These higher pharmacologic dosages appear
necessary to elicit the gains that the athletes desire. In
a classic study on the dose-response curve of anabolic
steroids, Forbes (81) demonstrated that the total dose
of anabolic steroids has a logarithmic relationship to
increases in lean body mass; low doses produce only
slight effects, but there is a progressive augmentation
of lean body mass with increasingly larger doses. These
results reinforce the athlete’s philosophy that if a low
dose is effective, then more must be better.
Athletes typically use higher doses of the substances
than are prescribed for men with low testosterone levels.
Methandrostenolone (Dianabol), for example, maintains
normal secondary sexual characteristics in hypogonadal
men at a replacement dose of approximately 15 mg/day;
athletes have reported using up to 300 mg/day (88). This
orally active drug has not been available for medical use
in the United States for more than a decade but is still
available through black market sources. Testosterone
enanthate is a testosterone ester and is an injectable
steroid that is readily available in the United States and
is used clinically for some rare diseases and for replacement treatment. A replacement dose is approximately 75
to 100 mg/week administered every one to two weeks.
Injectable steroids are administered intramuscularly,
typically by deep gluteal injections. They are also more
potent than oral steroids because of their route of delivery, and perhaps as well because they do not require
additional modification to protect them from immediate
metabolism by the liver. The injectable compounds have
a wide range of half-lives. Among the testosterone esters,
testosterone propionate remains in the circulation for
approximately 1.5 days, whereas testosterone buciclate
lasts for three months after a single injection (18).

in 1966 to improve national athletic performance using
androgens (49, 86). In the United States, widespread
use has also been reported in powerlifters (59), National
Football League players (125), and collegiate athletes
(167). Although results of several surveys suggest that
anabolic steroid use appears to have been declining over
the last few decades (133, 238), anabolic steroids are
among the top sport issues today because of accusations
of widespread use in many sports during the past few
years (84).
Strength athletes are not the only users of anabolic
steroids. People outside organized sport use steroids
to enhance appearance rather than performance (66).
National surveys of male American high school seniors
showed that approximately 7% were using, or had used,
anabolic steroids (14, 39). One-third of the admitted
steroid users were not involved in school-sponsored
sports, and more than one-fourth stated that their main
reason for using steroids was to improve appearance, as
opposed to athletic performance. Pope and his colleagues
(191, 193) described a subset of bodybuilders with an
altered self-image who believed that they looked small
and weak even though they were large and muscular.
These individuals used ergogenic substances and weight
training to increase their body size. Pope calls this
condition “reverse anorexia nervosa’; it is also known
as muscle dysmorphia. These bodybuilders appear to
be substantially different from competitive athletes in
terms of their objectives, the substantial health risks that
some of them are willing to take, and their strategies of
using extremely large doses of anabolic steroids. This
phenomenon may suggest why the most serious illnesses
associated with steroid use have occurred almost exclusively in bodybuilders and not in other steroid-using
athletes (88).

and athletic performance, particularly in sports requiring
maximal strength levels. When anabolic steroids are
taken at supraphysiologic doses, these ergogenic benefits
are realized (27, 240). The degree and incidence of these
changes are variable, depending greatly on, among other
factors, the training status of the individual (27).

a former United States senator, in the famous 2007

“Mitchell Report” stated that use of androgenic—anabolic steroids by Major League Baseball players in the
United States was pervasive (49). Before this revelation
of anabolic steroid use in athletes, earlier reports date
back to the 1952 and 1956 Olympics, in which there
were accounts of systematic use of androgens by the
Soviet weightlifting team (49). State-sponsored anabolic
steroid use in other countries has also been documented.

held constant. When anabolic steroids are given in doses
similar to those used by recreationally trained and competitive athletes, increases in muscle protein synthesis

are seen (106). These increases in protein synthesis are
likely responsible for the increases observed in lean
body mass in both recreationally trained and competitive
athletes taking anabolic steroids (111, 113, 153, 240,
250). Even when anabolic steroids are administered to
normal adult men not engaged in intensive resistance
training, increases in body mass, including the nonfat

component, are observed (27, 82, 88, 252). The extent

to which gains in lean body mass and maximal strength
occur with anabolic steroid use has been reported in the
scientific literature as a case study (2). In this study, an
adult male international-level bodybuilder self-injected
androgenic hormones (at a dosage of 53 mg/day) for a
training period of one year that included only a fourweek abstinence from drugs in the middle of the year.
During this time, the bodybuilder was able to gain about
7 kg (15 pounds) of fat-free weight, increase the mean
fiber area of the vastus lateralis muscle by approximately
11% in six months’ time, and significantly increase
maximal strength. Despite these improvements in muscle
mass and strength, the individual’s health status was negatively affected. Specifically, after drug withdrawal, the
subject experienced atrophic testicles and low luteinizing
hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone

levels. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was
also significantly lowered, which indicates a higher risk
for atherogenesis. See more information on the health
consequences of anabolic steroid use in the “Adverse
Effects” section.
For some time it was postulated that increases in
body mass with androgen use came from an increase
in body water (113). An increase in total body water is
expected with an increase in muscle mass, since water
constitutes a majority of the cellular weight; however, it
has been postulated that anabolic steroids may increase
water retention as well by increasing interstitial and
extracellular volume. Although water retention may
explain why not all of the weight gain is sustained after
cessation of anabolic steroid use, this issue is still not
well understood. In a study of experienced male bodybuilders, an eight-week cycle of nandrolone decanoate
(200 mg/week, intramuscularly) resulted in a significant 2.2 kg (4.8-pound) increase in body mass, a 2.6
kg (5.7-pound) increase in fat-free mass, and a 0.4 kg

(0.88-pound) decrease in fat mass, with no change in
hydration of fat-free mass (240). In addition, the extracellular and intracellular water ratio was unaltered. Even
after six weeks of discontinued androgen use, the body
mass of the bodybuilders was still significantly greater
than baseline levels (1.6 kg [3.5 pounds] greater), yet
no hydration changes were seen. The increase in fat-free
mass and possible reduction in fat mass may last for
several months after cessation of use (82) (figure 11.2).
Thus, athletes may derive a benefit from steroid use

even if they stop taking the drugs long enough before
competition to obtain a negative drug test. This is why
unannounced, year-round drug testing of some elite athletes is important for the prevention of unfair drug use.

Athletic Performance

Initially, researchers examining

the ergogenicity of exogenously administered anabolic
steroids were unable to see any significant performance
effects (75, 85, 161, 223). Consequently, the scientific
and medical community suggested that anabolic steroids
had little influence on athletic performance. This, however, was contrary to anecdotal reports emanating from
gyms and training centers that showed large strength
improvements in the athletes. Upon further examination of the initial studies, several methodological flaws
became apparent. Several of these studies used physiological doses, in contrast to the suprapharmacologic
doses that are typically taken by athietes self-administering androgens. In essence, these subjects were
shutting down their own endogenous production and
replacing it with an exogenous anabolic steroid. Another
flaw in some of these investigations was the method of
strength assessment. In several studies, strength performance was evaluated using a mode of exercise that
was different from the training stimulus. This lack of
specificity likely masked any possible training effect.
In addition, several studies used subjects who had only
minimal resistance training experience (85, 223). When
exogenous androgens have been administered to experienced resistance-trained athletes, significant strength
gains have been consistently reported (3, 113,217, 250).

Strength gains in experienced strength-trained athletes




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

are generally quite small relative to those seen in novice
lifters; but when strength-trained athletes use anabolic
steroids, their strength gains may be two- to threefold
higher than those typically seen in similarly trained
athletes who are not supplementing (113, 240, 250).
The purported ergogenic benefits commonly attributed to anabolic steroid use
are increased muscle mass, strength, and
athletic performance, but these changes
depend on the training status of the individual.

Psychological Effects
Anabolic steroid use is also associated with changes
in aggression, arousal, and irritability (174). The East
Germans reportedly used anabolic steroids for this effect,
delivering high doses to the central nervous system
by taking steroids through the nose. The issue has not
been well studied, but anecdotal reports suggest that
this practice markedly increased aggressiveness and
enhanced performance among athletes (65). Elevations
in arousal and self-esteem may be a positive side effect
for the anabolic steroid user. Increases in aggressiveness
may also be perceived as a benefit, especially for athletes
participating in contact sports.
Increased aggressiveness may not be confined to
athletic performance, however. Anabolic steroid users
experiencing increased aggressiveness may pose a threat
both to themselves and to those they come in contact
with (183, 192). Anabolic steroids are also associated
with mood swings and psychotic episodes. Studies have
shown that nearly 60% of anabolic steroid users experience increases in irritability and aggressiveness (192).
Pope and colleagues (194) reported significant elevations
in aggressiveness and manic scores following 12 weeks
of testosterone cypionate injections in a controlled double-blind crossover study. Interestingly, the results of this
study were not uniform across the subjects. Most subjects
showed little psychological effect, and few developed
prominent effects. A cause-and-effect relationship has
yet to be identified in anabolic steroid users, but it does
appear that individuals who experience psychological
or behavioral changes recover when steroid use is discontinued (91).

Adverse Effects
Adverse effects associated with anabolic steroid use are
listed in table 11.2. It is important to note that there are
differences between the side effects of anabolic steroid
use under medical supervision and those associated
with abuse (i.e., consumption of many drugs at high
doses). Most of the information concerning adverse
medical events associated with anabolic steroid use

Adverse effects

has been acquired from athletes self-administering the
drugs. In conjunction, some of the scientific literature
has suggested that the medical problems related to anabolic steroids may be somewhat overstated (26, 258),
considering that many of the side effects linked to abuse
are reversible upon cessation. Anecdotally, it appears
that a disproportionate magnitude of use and incidence
of adverse events are evident in bodybuilders (who are
also known for consuming several other drugs—such
as diuretics, thyroid hormones, insulin, and anti-estro-

gens—that relieve some side effects but potentiate other
risk factors as well) compared to strength and power
athletes.

Testosterone Precursors (Prohormones)
Prohormones are precursors to the synthesis of other
hormones and are theorized to increase the body’s ability
to produce a given specific hormone. The basis for the


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Methods

use of prohormones as an ergogenic aid evolved from
a study showing a threefold increase in testosterone
in healthy women who were given 100 mg of either
androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone (163).
Athletes who have continued to supplement with these
testosterone precursors (androstenedione, androstenediol, and dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) likely do
so on the premise that they will increase testosterone

they may be at higher risk for some ofthe negative side
effects associated with anabolic steroid use. Broeder and
colleagues (34), in the conclusion to their Andro Project
study in which they investigated the physiological and
hormonal influences of androstenedione in conjunction
with a high-intensity resistance training program, made
the following statement:

concentrations, strength, muscle size, and willingness to

Testosterone precursors do not enhance adaptations to resistance training when consumed in dosages recommended by manufacturers. Testosterone
precursor supplementation does result in signif-

train, as well as providing overall athletic performance
enhancements similar to those experienced by people
taking anabolic steroids. However, these precursors
have only relatively weak androgenic properties in
themselves; androstenedione and DHEA have only
1/Sth and 1/10th the biological activity of testosterone,
respectively (175). Nevertheless, testosterone precursors
were officially listed as controlled substances in the
2004 Anabolic Steroid Control Act passed by the U.S.
Congress, which mandated a physician’s prescription
for these substances.
Studies examining the efficacy of testosterone precursors have produced varying results. No significant
differences in strength or body composition were seen
in middle-aged men performing a resistance training
program while supplementing with either DHEA, androstenedione (100 mg), or a placebo for three months (248).
When DHEA supplementation (150 mg) was examined
in a group of younger males (19-29 years) on a twoweeks-on, one-week-off cycle for eight weeks, there

were no gains in strength or lean tissue (37). In addition,
the investigators were unable to see any changes in serum
testosterone, estrone, estradiol, or lipid concentrations

with supplementation. Even in studies using higher
dosages (300 mg) of androstenedione for eight weeks,
in a similar two-weeks-on, one-week-off protocol, no
significant effect was observed in strength, muscle size,
or testosterone concentrations (144). However, androstenedione supplementation did cause an increase in
serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone and was
associated with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
levels. These results suggest that although performance
changes may not occur in athletes taking this supplement,

icant increases in estrogen-related compounds,

dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations,
down-regulation

in testosterone

synthesis, and

unfavorable alterations in blood lipid and coronary
heart disease risk profiles of men aged 35 to 65
years. (p. 3093)

Based on the scientific evidence, it appears as if prohormones fall far short of providing the anabolic effects
generally associated with androgens (36). However, scientific research has focused almost exclusively on only a
few prohormone supplements—DHEA, androstenediol,
19-nor-androstenedione,

and 19-nor-androstenediol.

There are many other prohormone supplements available that have not been clinically tested. Also, use of
prohormones has not been studied in highly trained
athletes. In addition, oral administration has been the
primary method of taking prohormones. The oral use of
prohormones may not be as effective as other means of
intake (e.g., injection). All of this suggests that continued
study of the efficacy of the testosterone precursors for
performance enhancement is stil! needed; specifically
warranted is examination of other routes of ingestion
in a trained competitive athletic population.

HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is a hormone
obtained from the placenta of pregnant women and is very
closely related in structure and function to luteinizing
hormone. In fact, it is the pregnancy indicator used by

over-the-counter pregnancy test kits, since it is generally
not found in the body at any other time. In the general
population, HCG is sometimes injected into overweight
females under medical supervision in conjunction with
low-calorie diets for the purposes of weight loss (99).
Research suggests that when used for this purpose, HCG
is not effective for inducing weight loss. The caloric
restriction that accompanies the HCG injections appears
to be the main contributing factor to associated weight
loss (99).

Efficacy
While HCG offers females no performance-enhancing
ability, it is cited anecdotally as useful for males who
take anabolic steroids. When injected into men, HCG
can increase testicular testosterone production; testosterone levels can nearly double within four days after a
large intramuscular injection (54). The activity of HCG
in the male body is due to its ability to mimic luteinizing hormone, a pituitary hormone that stimulates the
Leydig cells in the testicles to manufacture testosterone
(160). The reason males would want to be injected with
HCG to increase endogenous testosterone levels is that
endogenous testosterone production is suppressed at
the end of a steroid cycle (173, 176). For that reason, if
HCG is used by athletes, it is likely used by those who
are finishing a cycle of anabolic steroids and are
looking to activate their own endogenous testosterone
production.

Adverse Effects
Human chorionic gonadotropin is given as an injection
under the skin or into a muscle; the side effects that are

common to such administration are pain, swelling, and
tenderness around the injection site. There is very little
research on the side effects of HCG injections. In one
investigation in which HCG was injected into obese
women, no adverse effects were reported in relation to
blood pressure or routine blood work (218).

Insulin
Insulin is a potent anabolic hormone. It is secreted by
the pancreas in response to elevations in blood glucose
or specific amino acid (e.g., leucine) concentrations. Its
role is to facilitate the uptake of glucose and amino acids
into the cell. Since insulin increases protein synthesis, it
is considered an anabolic hormone.

Efficacy
When insulin concentrations are elevated naturally (i.e.,
endogenously from the pancreas following carbohydrate
ingestion), there are no safety concerns in otherwise
healthy individuals. Additionally, several reports indi-

cate that postworkout carbohydrate ingestion suppresses
muscle protein breakdown via the anticatabolic effects of
insulin (32, 201). Theoretically, if protein breakdown is
suppressed over several weeks to months, gains in lean
muscle mass could be realized.
‘

Adverse Effects
Because of insulin’s anabolic properties and its rumored
ability to potentiate the effects of growth hormone and
insulin-like growth factors, some individuals (primarily bodybuilders) take insulin by injection. The use of
insulin in this manner comes with serious consequences.
Possible outcomes in a previously healthy athlete include
immediate death, coma, or the development of insulin-dependent diabetes (160).

Human Growth Hormone
Human growth hormone (HGH), a protein secreted
from the anterior pituitary gland, has several important
physiological functions that enhance its ergogenic effect.
It is anabolic due to its stimulation of bone and skeletal
muscle growth, but it also has important metabolic
functions such as maintaining blood glucose levels,
increasing the uptake of glucose and amino acids into
muscle cells (80), and stimulating release of fatty acids
from the fat cells.
The primary source of pharmacologic growth hormone is a relatively complicated molecule from which
it is synthetically derived using recombinant DNA
technology. However, until 1986, the only source of the
hormone was the pituitaries of human cadavers. Because
HGH receptors are unable to cross-react with growth
hormone from animal sources, the financial cost of HGH

was very high before 1986. Although the use of cadaver
growth hormone did not come without significant health
risks, these consequences did not prevent athletes from
taking the supplement but instead only substantially
restricted use (121). The development of recombinant
HGH provided clinicians with a relatively low-risk
drug at a lower cost (as compared to cadaver growth
hormone) with greater availability. Clinicians can now
prescribe recombinant HGH to increase stature in short
children with growth hormone deficiency and alter body
composition in adults. The use of HGH as a performanceenhancing substance is believed to be widespread among
professional athletes; it is either taken alone or stacked
with anabolic steroids (17). Even though recombinant
technology has increased the availability of HGH, its
cost, especially on the black market, is extremely high—
between several hundred and a few thousand dollars per
month. Humatrope, Nutropin, Norditropin, Genotropin,
Serostim, Saizen, and Protropin are brand names of HGH

commonly used in the United States.


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Methods

Efficacy
There.appear to be no studies on the efficacy of HGH in
professional athletes. Most investigations of HGH have
focused on HGH as replacement therapy in growth hormone—deficient adults and children or in healthy elderly
individuals. These studies have consistently shown
positive alterations in body composition (increases in
lean body tissue with decreases in body fat) (79, 120,
204, 228). In men with established growth hormone
deficiencies, nightly injections of recombinant HGH for
six months resulted in an average increase of 12 pounds
(5.4 kg) in lean body mass and a similar amount of fat
loss (204). Most studies have not addressed the effect of
HGH therapy on muscle strength and performance. One
study showed no changes in isokinetic strength following
12 months of therapy (120). However, the subjects in
that study did not perform any resistance training during
the course of treatment. A study involving trained adults
given growth hormone (three days per week for six
weeks) showed modest changes in body composition, but
no strength assessment was performed (58). Although
the scientific literature does not provide support for the
efficacy of HGH use in athletic populations, it is likely
that the inability to perform such studies (due to ethical
constraints) will limit much of our understanding of
HGH and human performance. In years past, the use
of HGH by athletes may have been prevalent in some
professional sports because of its perceived efficacy and
the fact that it could not be detected in random drug
tests. Currently, HGH cannot be detected in the urine
via a drug test, and it may be postulated that athletes
opt to use it for this reason. However, a blood test for
HGH was first introduced at the 2004 Summer Olympic
Games in Athens, Greece.

Growth hormone is a protein molecule. Injection is
necessary in order to avoid its complete metabolism and
maintain its effectiveness. Oral ingestion does not result
in any benefit. Many of the actions of growth hormone
are mediated through insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI), another peptide hormone, which is produced and
secreted from the liver in response to growth hormone
stimulation. Insulin-like growth factor I is now being
synthesized using recombinant DNA technology and
will likely produce the same effects as HGH.

Adverse Effects
The use of HGH does, however, present some potential

significant health risks. Excessive secretion of growth
hormone during childhood causes gigantism, a condition in which a person becomes abnormally tall. After
puberty, once linear growth has stopped, excess secretion
of growth hormone causes acromegaly, a disfiguring
disease characterized by a widening of the bones, arthri-

tis, organ enlargement, and metabolic abnormalities.
This is a potential risk for athletes who use HGH as an
ergogenic aid. In addition, these side effects may provide
some indication that the athlete could be using this drug.
In clinical studies in growth hormone-deficient adults,
side effects appear to be minimal for even up to two
years of replacement therapy (1, 120, 237). However,
athletes who supplement with HGH generally use dosages that far exceed the doses commonly administered in
replacement treatment (17). Thus, one should not assume
that HGH use is benign with regard to adverse medical
events in doses commonly used by an athletic population. Adverse side effects for HGH abuse are diabetes in
prone individuals; cardiovascular dysfunction; muscle,
joint, and bone pain; hypertension; abnormal growth of
organs; and accelerated osteoarthritis (17).
Although growth hormone used as replacement therapy for people with growth hormone or IGF-I deficiency can be effective and
can have minimal adverse consequences,
the dosages that are likely used by athletes
may pose a significant risk for acromegaly.

Erythropoietin
One of the limiting factors for endurance performance
is the athlete’s ability to deliver oxygen to the contracting skeletal muscle. Over the years, several methods
have been developed to increase the body’s ability to
deliver oxygen. Some methods include novel training
programs that may naturally elevate red blood cell and
hemoglobin levels (i.e., altitude training), while other
methods involve synthetic means to elevate the oxygen-carrying capacity ofthe blood (1.e., blood doping).
Blood doping increases one’s red blood cell mass and is
typically conducted using blood transfusions or taking a
hormone known as erythropoietin. There are two forms
of blood doping via blood transfusions: autologous and
homologous. Autologous blood doping is the transfusion
of one’s own blood, which has been stored (refrigerated
or frozen) until needed. Homologous blood doping is the

transfusion of blood that has been taken from another
person with the same blood type. Since the late 1980s,
blood doping via autologous blood transfusion has taken
a back seat to the more popular method, administration
of recombinant human erythropoietin (47).
Erythropoietin (EPO) is produced in the kidneys
and stimulates the production of new red blood cells.
It is also a protein hormone that can be produced by
recombinant DNA techniques and is reportedly being
abused by athletes (72). Erythropoietin use was one of
the methods of doping that Lance Armstrong admitted
to over the course of his cycling career. The EPO level




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

in the blood increases in response to chronic aerobic
endurance exercise. In certain types of anemia, especially
in kidney patients with inadequate EPO production,
recombinant human EPO can improve the quality of
life of the individual.

Efficacy
Injections of EPO are generally associated with elevations in both hematocrit and hemoglobin. When
EPO was given to normal men during six weeks of
treatment, hematocrit levels increased from 44.5% to
50%; hemoglobin concentrations increased by 10%;

aerobic capacity increased between 6% and 8%; and
the time to exhaustion improved by up to 17% (25, 73).
The enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood
makes EPO an effective ergogenic aid for the aerobic
endurance athlete.

Adverse Effects
While medically supervised use of EPO provides
therapeutic benefit in the treatment of anemia related
to kidney disease, its misuse can lead to serious health
risks for athletes who use this substance simply to gain
a competitive edge. The increase in hematocrit resulting from EPO injection presents a significant health
risk. Increases in red blood cell number increase blood
viscosity (the thickening of the blood). This poses
several problems that include increased risk of blood
clotting, elevations in systolic blood pressure, stroke, and
cerebral or pulmonary embolism (95). During aerobic
endurance events, the additional problem of dehydration
could compound cardiovascular risks by eliminating
any safety margin in the balance between performance
advantages from artificially increased hematocrit and
decrements from increased blood viscosity. The deaths
of a number of competitive cyclists have been related
to EPO administration (95). The primary risk associated
with EPO is its lack of predictability compared to red
blood cell infusion. Once EPO is injected into the body,
the stimulus for producing red blood cells is no longer
under control. Consequently, aerobic endurance athletes
should avoid this drug because of the significant cardiovascular risk, leading to possible death, associated with
its administration.

-Adrenergic Agonists
Synthetic B-adrenergic agonists, or B-agonists, are
substances chemically related to epinephrine, a hormone
produced in the adrenal medulla that regulates physiological effects, such as lipolysis (the breakdown of
fat) and thermogenesis (increased energy expenditure
resulting in the production of heat). B-Agonists were
originally developed for the treatment of asthma and

other life-threatening medical conditions. Some of these
compounds have been found to have specific effects on
body composition, such as increases in lean mass and
decreases in stored fat (195); because of this, these drugs
are sometimes referred to as partitioning agents (24).
One of the more popular B-agonists used by athletes is
the drug clenbuterol (195).

Efficacy
Clenbuterol is a 8,-agonist and is a widely used bronchodilator (used to reverse bronchial restriction) in
many parts of the world. Athletes use clenbuterol as an
ergogenic aid to increase lean muscle tissue and reduce
subcutaneous fat (195). Data on the effectiveness of
clenbuterol have typically been based not on healthy
athletes, but rather subjects with heart failure (138),
patients experiencing muscle-wasting conditions (165),
and animal models (162, 164). Though studies in humans
are limited, several findings have indicated an ergogenic
potential of 8,-agonists for strength improvements (164,
166). Athletes generally use clenbuterol in doses twice
the recommended amounts administered for clinical
purposes, in a cyclic fashion (three weeks on alternated
with three weeks off, with a two-days-on, two-days-off
cycle during the “on” week) (195). It is believed that
this cycling regimen avoids B,-receptor downregulation
(160).

Adverse Effects
Athletes consume clenbuterol in a capsule form, in contrast to the inhalation route that is often used for relieving
bronchial constriction. Although a number of potential
side effects have been suggested (i.e., transient tachycardia, hyperthermia, tremors, dizziness, palpitations, and

insomnia), actual documented events are quite limited
(160). In addition, the scarcity of data on the ergogenic
potential of clenbuterol in humans makes determining
its efficacy difficult.

6-Blockers
B-Blockers are a class of drugs that block the Badrenergic receptors, preventing the catecholamines
(i.e., norepinephrine and epinephrine) from binding.
8-Blockers are generally prescribed by cardiologists
for the treatment of a wide variety of cardiovascular
diseases, including hypertension. The ergogenic benefit of these drugs may reside in their ability to reduce
anxiety and tremors during performance (155). Thus,
athletes who rely on steady, controlled movements
during performance (i.e., archers or marksmen) would
appear to benefit from these drugs. Also, B-blockers may
improve physiological adaptations from aerobic endurance training by causing an upregulation of 8-receptors.


Performance-Enhancing Substances and f\Methods

If this is true, it would result in an exaggerated response
to sympathetic discharge during intense exercise upon
cessation of supplementation.

Efficacy
Several studies have shown that B-blockers can improve
both slow and fast shooting accuracy (7, 152). In addition, the dose taken appears to have significant effects
on the magnitude of improvement. In shooters who
administered B-blockers in two different doses (80 mg
vs. 40 mg of oxprenolol), the group taking the higher
dose shot with greater accuracy (7). In certain sports,
however, some degree of anxiety may be important.
Tesch (229) reported that bowlers whose performance
was improved during blockade with oxprenolol had
significantly greater heart rates before, during, and after
competition than subjects whose performance did not
improve while on B-blockers.

Adverse Effects
8-Blockers may also have an ergolytic effect (reduce
performance). Studies have shown that B-blockers
impair the cardiovascular response to exercise by reducing maximal heart rate, oxygen consumption, and 10 km
race time performance (6). Also, B-blockers are associated with an increased rate of perceived exertion (229).
Risks associated with these drugs include bronchospasm,
heart failure, prolonged hypoglycemia, bradycardia,
heart block, and intermittent claudication (89).

Dietary Supplements
The sport supplement industry throughout the world
continues to increase, with the global sport nutrition
market valued at US$20.7 billion in 2012 and having
an expected value of over US$37 billion by 2019 (235).
Some sport nutrition companies make unsubstantiated
claims concerning the efficacy of their products. At
times, unscrupulous companies have knowingly placed
analogues of banned substances in their products to
enhance their effects (50). As a result, much confusion
has been created among athletes regarding appropriate
supplements and the ethics of companies. This section
describes dietary supplements that are commonly used
by athletes and presents scientific examination of their
efficacy.

Essential Amino Acids, Branched-Chain
Amino Acids
Essential amino acids (EAAs) are not produced in the
body and must be obtained through the diet. They include
histidine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, and tryptophan. High levels of

the EAAs can be found in any number of animal-based
proteins or as supplements sold over the counter. Leucine
can also be found in plants such as spinach and broccoli,
but the amount of leucine is minimal when compared to
that in animal-based sources.

Efficacy
Scientists have been able to delineate certain categories
of amino acids as well as individual amino acids and
their role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. For
example, Tipton and colleagues (230, 231) reported that
nonessential amino acids were not necessary to stimulate
muscle protein synthesis; rather, only the presence of
EAAs is needed. In this research (230), six healthy adults
(three males and three females) participated in resistance
exercise (eight sets of eight repetitions at 80% of 1-repetition maximum [1RM}) and then consumed either 40
g of mixed amino acids (composed ofboth nonessential
and essential amino acids), 40 g of EAA, or a placebo.
While the mixed amino acids and the EAA induced an
anabolic response that was significantly greater than with
the placebo treatment, there was no difference between
the amino acid treatments. Since there was no difference,

it was concluded that nonessential amino acids are not
needed to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. In a follow-up study, using the same protocol (but with only 6 g
EAA and 35 g sugar), Rasmussen and colleagues (197)
demonstrated significantly greater anabolic drive—that
is, the building of new muscle tissue—with the EAA
supplement (when given shortly after resistance exercise) versus the placebo.
Subsequently, Tipton and colleagues (232) examined
the effects of consuming 6 g EAA plus 36 g of sugar,
before or after resistance training, on muscle protein
metabolism. They reported that when the EAA plus sugar
was consumed 30 minutes before resistance training,
the acute (3 hours postexercise) anabolic response was
158% greater than when the EAA and sugar supplement
were consumed posttraining. As a result of these acute
findings, Tipton and colleagues (232) and Rasmussen
and colleagues (197) theorized that a person who consumed EAA before or after (or both before and after)
every resistance training session over a period of weeks
would experience greater changes in muscle mass than
with training only. It is important to note that although
the nonessential amino acids are not required to stimulate
muscle protein synthesis, this does not mean that they
are not important for maximizing training adaptations in
the athlete. The conditionally essential and nonessential
amino acids serve as the substrates that are incorporated
into the newly formed muscle proteins; further, they
also spare the conversion of these amino acids from the

essential ones, thus effectively increasing the levels of
EAAs.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Prior work in animal models further identified that
of the eight EAAs, it is the branched-chain amino
acids (BCAAs)—isoleucine, leucine, and valine—that

are responsible for increasing muscle protein synthesis
(96). Of the BCAAs, it appears that leucine is the key
amino acid for stimulating muscle protein synthesis (42,
139, 199) via the Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway (figure 11.3). Norton and coworkers
(180) demonstrated in rodent models that a leucine
threshold for stimulating muscle protein synthesis
exists. Based on this pioneering research, many nutrition
researchers now believe that the leucine content in any
given protein intake is the rate-limiting factor in terms
of maximizing muscle protein synthesis within the
capacity of skeletal muscle, rather than simply the total
amount of protein ingested. To support this theory of the
importance of the content of a protein meal, Pasiakos and
colleagues (185) reported that a leucine-enriched EAA
beverage resulted in a significant elevation of muscle
protein synthesis compared to a normal leucine-containing EAA beverage. In this study, trained males ingested
one of two different 10 g EAA beverages during cycling
exercise—one containing 3.5 g of leucine (46 mg/kg
body mass) and the other containing 1.87 g of leucine
(~25 mg/kg body mass). After the exercise bout (during a
3-hour assessment period), muscle protein synthesis was
33% greater in the leucine-enriched EAA beverage. The
importance of leucine intake and its role in the anabolic
response of skeletal muscle following resistance training
is a popular topic in sport nutrition research today.

Adverse Effects
No known reports or scientific studies have investigated
the adverse effects of branched-chain amino acid or EAA
supplementation.
The branched-chain amino acid leucine is a
key regulator in stimulating muscle protein
synthesis. Leucine directly activates the Akt/
mTOR pathway in skeletal muscle, which
is a key pathway in skeletal muscle protein
synthesis.

Arginine
Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid and has
crucial roles in nutrition and metabolism. Arginine is
required for the synthesis of protein and creatine, and its
metabolism results in the production of nitric oxide. The
claims often attributed to arginine supplementation are
its ability to elevate nitric oxide levels, increase muscle
blood flow, and improve exercise performance. Each of
these claims is directed at athletes or physically active
individuals, as these are all outcomes that would be ben-

eficial for enhancing sport performance or maximizing
training adaptations. Unfortunately, there is very little
scientific evidence supporting these claims regarding
arginine supplementation in the populations that these
outcomes would benefit.

Efficacy
Oral arginine supplementation is most often marketed
for its potential to elevate nitric oxide levels. Nitric
oxide possesses many physiological roles in the human
body, but its effects on vasodilation (i.e., the widening
of blood vessels) are what make it important during
exercising conditions. During exercise, nitric oxide
levels are naturally increased so that more blood can
flow through the arteries and arterioles for the purpose
of delivering oxygen and fuel substrates to the working
skeletal muscles (30). While nitric oxide is essential for
vasodilation, the overwhelming majority of the scientific
literature does not support the claim that oral arginine
supplementation increases nitric oxide production to
levels that are greater than the effects of exercise alone
in healthy individuals (5, 159, 208). In contrast to healthy
individuals, those with risk factors for cardiovascular

disease or people who have diabetes may benefit from
increased nitric oxide production resulting from oral
arginine supplementation (135, 136).
A natural outcome of nitric oxide production is
an increased muscle blood flow. Therefore, increas-

ing muscle blood flow is also a popular claim that is
made regarding arginine’s effectiveness. Despite the
common perception among athletes and consumers

Performance-Enhancing Substances and Methods

of dietary supplements that arginine supplementation
does increase muscle blood flow, nearly all scientific
investigations into this area are in agreement that muscle
blood flow is not increased in healthy individuals following arginine supplementation (76, 77, 226). Oral
arginine supplementation has also been purported to
improve endurance exercise performance. However, in
research investigating arginine’s effectiveness in healthy
populations, it was reported that time to exhaustion,
local muscular endurance, and intermittent anaerobic

exercise performance were not improved as a result of
supplementation (104, 159, 239). Due to its inability to
increase nitric oxide production, enhance muscle blood
flow, or improve several modes of endurance exercise,
oral arginine supplementation is not recommended for
healthy athletes.

Adverse Effects
A majority of the scientific investigations in which
arginine was given to participants to improve exercise
performance used a 6 g dose. While this dose of arginine
was not effective in improving endurance performance,
this amount was well tolerated and posed no adverse
side effects. Oral supplementation at doses up to 13 g
is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse
reactions to higher doses (13 to 30 g) include gastrointestinal distress consistent with nausea, abdominal cramps,
and diarrhea (51).
Due to its inability to increase nitric oxide
production, enhance muscle blood flow, or
improve endurance exercise performance,
oral arginine supplementation is not recommended for healthy athletes.

6-Hydroxy-8-Methylbutyrate
8-Hydroxy-B-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a derivative of
the EAA leucine and its metabolite a-ketoisocaproic
acid. Evidence shows that HMB stimulates protein
synthesis (74) and decreases protein breakdown by
inhibiting the ubiquitin—proteasome pathway (211). Due
to HMB’s role in the regulation of protein breakdown, it
may be an effective supplement for minimizing losses of
lean muscle mass in situations that promote a catabolic
state. B-Hydroxy-8-methylbutyrate is not currently
banned or restricted by sport organizations.

Efficacy
The initial research study that highlighted HMB’s anticatabolic potential was conducted by Nissen and colleagues (179). In this study, untrained subjects ingested
one ofthree levels of HMB (0, 1.5, or 3.0 g per day) and
two protein levels (117 or 175 g per day) and resistance

trained three days per week for three weeks. As a measure
of myofibrillar protein breakdown, urinary 3-methylhistidine levels were measured (higher levels of urinary 3-methyl-histidine mean that more muscle protein
is catabolized, or broken down). After the first week

of the resistance training protocol, urinary 3-methylhistidine was increased by 94% in the control group and
by 85% and 50% in those individuals ingesting 1.5 and 3
g of HMB per day, respectively. During the second week
ofthe study, urinary 3-methyl-histidine levels were still
elevated by 27% in the control group but were 4% and
15% below basal levels for the 1.5 and 3 g of HMB per
day groups. At the end of the third week of resistance
training, urinary 3-methyl-histidine levels were not significantly different between the groups (179).
Research in other catabolic-inducing environments
has also demonstrated the effectiveness of HMB supplementation. For example, when older adults were con-

fined to complete bed rest (a catabolic state) for 10 days,
it was reported that the subjects who were supplemented
with 3 g of HMB per day lost significantly less lean body
mass (lost only 0.37 pounds [0.17 kg]) as compared to
those subjects who were supplemented with a placebo
(lost 4.5 pounds {2.05 kg]) (64). Other research findings
are in agreement with these observations and have shown
that HMB exerts an anticatabolic effect and suppresses
muscle damage (146, 241).
In previously untrained individuals initiating a resistance training program lasting four to eight weeks, HMB
has been shown to exert significantly greater improvements in strength and lean body mass as compared to a
placebo (94, 179, 184). The muscle damage and soreness
that result from resistance training are predictably greater
in those who have little training experience as compared
to individuals who have engaged in resistance training
for longer periods of time. Given HMB’s ability to suppress muscle damage and muscle protein breakdown,
it is not surprising that HMB is effective for people
beginning a new training program.
The ergogenic effects of HMB in trained individuals
are less conclusive. Studies using resistance-trained or
competitive athletes were unable to duplicate the results
seen in a recreationally trained population using similar
supplementation schedules (150, 181, 196). However,

many of the studies investigating the effects of HMB
on strength and lean body mass in trained individuals
were of short duration (less than five weeks) and lacked
the presence of a periodized, high-intensity training
program. In order for HMB to be effective, it may be
essential to provide novel stimuli to individuals to induce
either muscle damage or stimulate elevated protein
breakdown.
Research suggests that trained individuals instructed
not to change their programs do not benefit from HMB




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

(150). In a recent investigation, it was reported that
highly resistance-trained males undergoing a periodized
resistance training program and ingesting supplemental
HMB realized significant improvements in total strength
and lean body mass as compared to a placebo group that
participated in an identical training program (257). Other
investigations that have provided an adequate training stimulus in trained individuals have also reported
increases in maximal strength and lean body mass as
compared to placebo treatments (179, 184).

Adverse Effects
The duration, dosage, and timing of HMB supplementation have notably varied in the scientific literature. In
nearly every published investigation related to HMB
supplementation, 3 to 6 g per day was ingested. Three
grams per day (often divided into several doses) is the
most common dosage used in published studies. The
majority of studies investigating HMB have used the
calcium salt of HMB—HMB-Ca. Recently, another
form of HMB, HMB-free acid, has been investigated

as well (257). The safety of HMB supplementation has
been widely studied and to date there is a consensus that
HMB presents no known adverse effects.
-Hydroxy-B-methylbutyrate is most effective when an adequate training stimulus
is provided. For untrained individuals, this
does not likely require high-volume training.
For trained individuals, a high-intensity,
high-volume resistance training program
is likely needed in order for benefits to be
realized with HMB supplementation.

Nutritional Muscle Buffers
During high-intensity anaerobic exercise, a significant
accumulation of hydrogen ions (H*) is coupled with a
reduction of pH within skeletal muscle and has been
shown to adversely affect performance (200). The ability
to regulate H* concentration in skeletal muscle during
high-intensity exercise has been termed muscle buffering capacity (MBC) (22, 178). There is a strong positive
relationship between MBC and exercise performance
(repeated-sprint ability, high-intensity exercise capacity,
anaerobic threshold, and training volume) (70, 71). In
fact, researchers have demonstrated a positive relationship between exercise performance and MBC in athletes
who participate in sports like basketball, soccer, hockey,
cycling, crew (rowing), triathlons, and sprinting (29, 70,
71). In theory, improving MBC by training or nutritional
means (B-alanine, sodium bicarbonate, or citrate) would

improve performance in sports and activities that may
be limited by H’* buildup. Therefore a brief review of B-

alanine, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium citrate and their

effects on high-intensity exercise performance follows.

6 -Alanine
8-Alanine is a nonessential amino acid that is common
in many foods that we eat, such as chicken. By itself,

B-alanine has limited ergogenic properties. However, in
muscle cells, it is the rate-limiting substrate for carnosine
synthesis (68). Harris and colleagues (110) reported
that four weeks of supplementing with B-alanine (4 to
6 g/day) resulted in a mean increase of 64% in skeletal
muscle B-alanine concentrations. In humans, carnosine
is found primarily in fast-twitch (Type II) skeletal muscle
and is estimated to contribute up to 40% of the skeletal
MBC of H* produced during intense anaerobic exercise,
thus encouraging a drop in pH (110, 114). Theoretically,
increasing skeletal muscle carnosine levels through
chronic training or B-alanine supplementation (or both)
would improve MBC and most likely improve anaerobic
performance. Interestingly, carnosine concentrations in
athletes such as sprinters and bodybuilders appear to be
significantly higher than those in marathoners, untrained
individuals, and people who are elderly (110, 224).
Suzuki and colleagues (224) examined the relationship between skeletal muscle carnosine levels and
high-intensity exercise performance in trained cyclists.
The authors reported a significant and positive relationship between carnosine concentration and mean power
in a 30-second maximal sprint on a cycle ergometer.
This finding supported the theory that skeletal muscle
carnosine levels have a positive correlation with anaerobic performance because of the relationship between
carnosine and MBC.

Efficacy -Alanine has been studied for its effects on
strength, aerobic power, and high-intensity short-term
exercises interspersed with short recovery intervals. In
contrast to creatine, B-alanine does not seem to improve
maximal strength (140, 122, 123). Similarly, aerobic
power does not appear to be improved with B-alanine
supplementation (123, 140). Even though aerobic power
is not improved, supporting data indicate that anaerobic
threshold is improved with B-alanine supplementation
(221, 259). Practically, improving anaerobic threshold
(as measured by the lactate and ventilatory thresholds)
means that endurance activities can be performed at
relatively higher intensities for longer periods. Hill and
colleagues (114) examined the effect of B-alanine supplementation on muscle carnosine levels and exercise
performance in untrained subjects. In a double-blind
fashion, 25 male subjects (19-31 years) supplemented
with either 4.0 g B-alanine or sugar placebo for the first
week, then with up to 6.4 g for an additional nine weeks.
Muscle carnosine levels (via muscle biopsy) and total


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Met!

work done (kilojoules) were measured at weeks 0, 4,
and 10 during cycling to exhaustion at maximal power
established from a graded exercise cycle ergometry test.
Mean carnosine levels increased by 58% at week 4 and
an additional 15% at week 10. Additionally, 13% and
16% increases in total work done during cycle ergometry
were seen at weeks 4 and 10, respectively.
In a comprehensive review summarizing the effects
of B-alanine supplementation on high-intensity performance, Artioli and colleagues (9) stated that B-alanine
ingestion is capable of improving performance in exercises resulting in an extreme intramuscular acidotic
environment, such as multiple bouts of high-intensity
exercises lasting more than 60 seconds, as well as
single bouts undertaken when fatigue is already present. High-intensity exercises performed with a lower
level of acidosis are unlikely to benefit from B-alanine
supplementation.

Adverse Effects In the published literature, B-alanine
ingestion has ranged from 2.4 to 6.4 g per day. In many
B-alanine trials, the total daily amount of B-alanine
ingestion was divided into two to four smaller doses.
The reason for the smaller dosing strategies is to prevent
the only reported adverse effect of B-alanine supplementation, which is the symptom of paresthesia (tingling,
pricking, or numbness of a person’s skin) (9). Symptoms
of paresthesia are triggered by a high and acute single
dose and disappear within approximately | hour after
the ingestion (9, 110).

Sodium Bicarbonate
Sodium bicarbonate is an antacid (alkalinizing agent),
meaning that it counteracts or neutralizes acid (low pH).
Sodium bicarbonate is naturally formed in the body
and is also found in baking soda. Supplementation with
sodium bicarbonate has been shown to increase the pH
of blood (219). A pH difference is created between the
inside and outside of muscle cells that causes an accelerated movement of H* out of the contracting muscle,
helping to regulate intramuscular pH. Supplementing
with sodium bicarbonate has been shown to improve
MBC and in turn high-intensity exercise performance.

Efficacy

Most research investigating the efficacy of

sodium bicarbonate for enhancing sport performance
has focused on short bouts of high-intensity exercise
lasting 60 seconds to 6 minutes (172). McNaughton and
colleagues (169, 171) and Coombes and McNaughton
(55) have demonstrated improved total work capacity, peak power, peak torque, and strength from acute
sodium bicarbonate supplementation in men and women.
Recently, Hobson and coworkers (117) examined the
effects of sodium bicarbonate ingestion during a 2,000
m rowing ergometer time trial in experienced male

rowers. The rowers were supplemented before exercise
with 0.3 g/kg body mass of sodium bicarbonate or a
placebo. Time to complete the 2,000 m and time taken
for each 500 m split were recorded. While there were
no significant differences in the overall 2,000 m time
trial, the sodium bicarbonate did result in significant
improvements in the third and final 500 m time splits.
Some investigations (28, 157), but not all (10), have

reported similar improvements in high-intensity exercise tollowing 0.3 g/kg body mass sodium bicarbonate
supplementation. The timing ofthe sodium bicarbonate
ingestion used in many scientific investigations is typically 60 to 90 minutes before the bout of exercise.

Adverse Effects

It appears that a dosage of 0.3 g/kg

body mass (136 mg/pound of body mass) sodium bicarbonate ingested approximately 60 to 90 minutes before
activity improves short-duration, high-intensity exercise
performance (117, 172). Dosages above this amount
have been associated with unpleasant side effects such
as diarrhea, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. A more
tolerable dose (0.2 g/kg [90 mg/pound] of body weight)
has been shown to reduce these side effects; however,

research has revealed that this dose does not improve
exercise performance (156). It appears that a minimum
sodium bicarbonate dose of 0.3 g/kg body mass, 60
to 90 minutes before exercise, is needed to improve
performance (126, 251). Due to the severity ofthe side
effects (which may be experienced by some athletes
even when ingesting 0.3 g/kg body mass), many sport
scientists recommend that athletes try sodium bicarbonate supplementation during practice before using it as a
precompetition aid.

Sodium Citrate
Although sodium citrate is not actually a base, it can
increase blood pH without the gastrointestinal distress
that is commonly seen with sodium bicarbonate supplementation (242). It is believed that once in the blood,
sodium citrate actually breaks down into bicarbonate,
thus increasing the extracellular pH (233). As a result,
sodium citrate would help regulate intramuscular pH
during high-intensity exercise by the same mechanism
as sodium bicarbonate.

Efficacy

The data are equivocal in terms of the effec-

tiveness of sodium citrate’s ergogenic potential during
short-duration, high-intensity exercise, with some
investigations reporting no benefit (15, 57, 203, 242)
and others having observed an ergogenic effect (158,
170). For example, a dose of 200 mg per pound ofbody
weight (0.44 g per kilogram of weight) given 60 to 90
minutes before exercise led to significant improvement (about 20% greater) in leg muscular endurance
during maximal isometric knee extensions (112). More




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

research, however, is needed before sodium citrate can

be recommended before a workout or competition for
performance enhancement.

Adverse Effects

Sodium citrate may possess MBC

and has been used without the typical gastrointestinal
discomfort usually associated with sodium bicarbonate
ingestion (15, 158). Even though it appears that the
adverse effects of sodium citrate supplementation are
lower than those of sodium bicarbonate, ingestion of 0.4
to 0.6 g/kg body mass sodium citrate has the potential
to cause gastrointestinal distress (182, 205). The gastrointestinal response seems to vary among individuals;
therefore athletes should individually test sodium citrate
supplementation before using it in competition.

L-Carnitine
L-carnitine is synthesized from the amino acids lysine
and methionine and is responsible for the transport of
fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria to be
oxidized for energy (142). Carnitine’s role in lipid oxidation has generated interest in its efficacy as a dietary
supplement, primarily to enhance exercise performance
by increasing fat utilization and sparing muscle glycogen. However, studies examining L-carnitine’s role as
an ergogenic aid for increasing lipid oxidation have
not shown clear efficacy in either human or rat models
(8, 33). Although Bacurau and colleagues (13) showed
enhanced fatty acid oxidation following three weeks of
L-carnitine supplementation, which was attributed to
a greater carnitine content in the muscle, most studies
have been unable to demonstrate elevated muscle carnitine levels following supplementation (16, 247). This
may be related to limits in the amount of carnitine that
can be absorbed through oral supplementation (131),
or potentially related to limits in the amount of fat that
can be transported into the mitochondria through the
carnitine system due to feedback regulators within the
muscle, such as malonyl—-coenzyme A, which is a product of metabolism.

Efficacy
Interestingly, several studies have suggested that
L-carnitine may enhance recovery from exercise (116,
129, 245). Decreases in pain and muscle damage (97),
decreases in markers of metabolic stress (214), and
enhanced recovery (245) have also been demonstrated

following high-intensity resistance exercise in untrained
or recreationally trained individuals who supplemented
with L-carnitine. The mechanisms that have been proposed involve enhancing blood flow regulation through
an enhanced vasodilatory effect that reduces the magnitude of exercise-induced hypoxia (130). In addition,
Kraemer and colleagues indicated that L-carnitine

supplementation (2 g/day for three weeks) upregulates
androgen receptors (147) and increases IGF binding
proteins that preserve IGF-I concentrations (148). These
endocrine adaptations from the supplement may have an
important role in the enhanced recovery seen following
high-intensity exercise.

Adverse Effects
Up to 3 g of daily L-carnitine supplementation (for three
weeks) appears to be well tolerated in healthy volunteers,
with no adverse subjective, hematological, or metabolic
events reported (202). Yet as with most supplements,
this information should not be extrapolated to suggest
the safety of greater dosing or of use for prolonged
supplementation periods.

Creatine
Creatine is a nitrogenous organic compound that is
synthesized naturally in the body, primarily in the liver,
and helps to supply energy to all cells in the body. It
can also be synthesized in smaller amounts in both the
kidneys and pancreas. The amino acids arginine, glycine,
and methionine are the precursors for the synthesis of
creatine in those organs. Creatine can also be obtained
though dietary sources. It is found in relative abundance
in both meat and fish. Approximately 98% of creatine is
stored within skeletal muscle in either its free form (40%)
or its phosphorylated form (60%). Smaller amounts of
creatine are also stored in the heart, brain, and testes.

Creatine is transported from its site of synthesis to the
skeletal muscle via circulation.

Importance of Creatine to Exercise
Creatine, in the form of creatine phosphate (CP; also
called phosphocreatine [PCr]), has an essential role
in energy metabolism as a substrate for the formation
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by rephosphorylating adenosine diphosphate (ADP), especially during
short-duration, high-intensity exercise. The ability
to rapidly rephosphorylate ADP is dependent on the
enzyme creatine kinase and the availability of CP within
the muscle. As CP stores become depleted, the ability to
perform high-intensity exercise declines. In short-duration sprints (e.g., 100 m sprint), the energy for fueling
the activity is derived primarily through the hydrolysis
of CP (93). However, as high-intensity exercise increases
in duration, the ability of CP to serve as an energy source
is drastically reduced.
Depletion of muscle CP during high-intensity exercise
is the primary mechanism leading to fatigue in such
events. During a 6-second bout of maximal exercise,

CP levels within the muscle are reduced 35% to 57%
from resting levels (93). As the duration of high-intensity


Performance-Ennancing Substances and Methods

exercise increases to 30 seconds, CP levels in the muscle

are further reduced by approximately 64% to 80% from
resting levels (31, 48); during bouts of repeated high-intensity exercise, CP levels in the muscle are almost
completely depleted (168). As muscle CP concentrations
decrease, the ability to perform maximal exercise is
reduced. Hirvonen and colleagues (115) demonstrated
that sprint times were slower as CP concentrations
were reduced. It stands to reason that if muscle CP concentrations could be maintained, the ability to sustain
high-intensity exercise would be improved. This is the
basis for creatine supplementation in athletes.

Creatine Supplementation
Reports suggest that 37.2% of collegiate athletes use,
or have used, creatine during their preparation for competition (90). However, the prevalence of use among
strength/power athletes may approach more than 80%
in certain sports (154). Creatine use has also gained
popularity among high school athletes; 90% of athletes
who supplement choose creatine (225). As a result of
their widespread use, creatine supplements may be the
most extensively studied ergogenic aid in recent history.
Creatine supplementation is reported to increase the
creatine content of muscles by approximately 20% (40,
78, 132). However, it appears that a saturation limit for
creatine exists within muscle. Once creatine concentrations in skeletal muscle reach 150 to 160 mmol/kg dry
weight, additional supplementation appears to be unable
to further increase muscle creatine concentrations (102).
This has important implications for the “more is better”
philosophy that governs the thinking of some athletes,
and may affect the development of proper and realistic
dosing schemes.

A typical creatine supplementation regimen involves
a loading dose of20 to 25 g daily for five days, or 0.3 g/
kg body mass if an individual wishes to dose relative to
body weight, followed by a maintenance dose of 2 g/day
(132). If one ingests creatine without an initial loading
dose, muscle creatine content will reach levels similar

to those seen in people who do initially use a loading
dose, but reaching that muscle creatine concentration
will take longer (~30 days vs. 5 days). Muscle creatine
levels will remain elevated as long as the maintenance
dose is maintained (2 g/day or 0.03 g/kg body mass per
day) (132). Once creatine supplementation is stopped,
muscle creatine levels will return to baseline levels in
approximately four weeks (78, 132).

Efficacy
Most studies examining the effect of creatine supplementation on strength performance have been fairly consistent in showing significant ergogenic benefits (23, 141,
186, 243, 246) (refer to figure 11.4). Strength increases
in the bench press, squat, and power clean may be two- to
threefold higher in trained athletes supplementing with
creatine compared to placebo (122, 186). These results
may highlight the benefit of creatine supplementation in
experienced resistance-trained athletes whose potential
to improve strength may be limited. In experienced
strength athletes, supplementing with creatine may also

Creatine supplementation has been shown
to increase maximal strength, power, and
lean body mass in both trained and untrained
populations. Additionally, creatine supplementation is safe and relatively inexpensive.

enhance the quality of workouts (less fatigue, enhanced
recovery), which may be crucial for providing a greater
training stimulus to the muscle.
Most studies examining the effects of creatine supplementation on a single bout of explosive exercise (sprint
performance) have not shown any significant performance improvements (62, 145, 177, 212). However, in

many of these studies, subjects were supplemented with
a loading dose for only five days (145, 177, 212). While
ingesting creatine with a loading dose for five days will
significantly increase intramuscular creatine stores, this
is likely not enough time for training adaptations to occur
and to be manifested in explosive exercise performance
improvements. When subjects have supplemented for
an extended period of time (28-84 days), significant
improvements in jump and power performance have
been seen (108, 243). It appears that creatine is more
effective as a training supplement than as a direct performance enhancer.

Another concern with any supplement is the longterm health effects. A retrospective study on health
variables in 26 former or current competitive athletes
who had used creatine for up to four years indicated
only occasional gastrointestinal upset during the loading phase (206). These disturbances ranged from gas
to mild diarrhea. Other hypothesized major concerns
during creatine supplementation include a strain on the
kidneys due to the high nitrogen content of creatine and
increased creatine excretion during short-term ingestion.
However, no renal dysfunction has been reported with
either short-term (five days) or long-term (up to five
years) creatine use (189, 190).
Despite certain media and anecdotal reports
linking creatine supplementation to dehydration and cramping, there is no reason to
believe that creatine enhances the risk for
these side effects.

Body Mass Changes

Stimulants

Prolonged creatine supplementation has been generally associated with increases in body weight. These
increases appear to primarily relate to increases in
fat-free mass. The increase in body mass is believed to
be partly related to an increase in total body water. An
increase in creatine content within the muscle is thought
to enhance the intracellular osmotic gradient, causing
water to fill the cell (244). In addition, increasing the
creatine content of muscle appears to be coupled with
an increased rate of muscle contractile protein synthesis
(246, 255). In general, creatine supplementation during
training is typically associated with a 1- to 4.5-pound
(0.5-2 kg) greater increase in body mass or fat-free mass
(151) over a period of several weeks to several months.

There is little question about the usefulness of stimulants to many types of athletic endeavors; the effects of
stimulants include reduced fatigue, increased alertness,
increased confidence, and even euphoria. Because
stimulants have to be used at the time of competition to
confer an ergogenic advantage, drug testing performed
immediately after the competition can effectively reduce
their abuse (128). However, many stimulants (e.g.,
caffeine) are also available in food items, while others
(e.g., ephedrine) may be found in decongestants and
other medications.

Adverse Effects
Increase in body mass has at times been referred to as a
potential unwanted side effect of creatine supplementation (206), particularly in relation to strength-to-mass or
power-to-mass ratio. However, in athletes supplementing
with creatine, weight gain is often a desired outcome.
When people talk about side effects from a drug or
supplement, they are generally referring to a potentially
debilitating effect. There have been many anecdotal
reports of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and muscular
problems, including muscle cramps, in association with
creatine ingestion. However, controlled studies have
been unable to document any significant side effects
from creatine supplementation. Even during prolonged
supplementation (several weeks up to many months), no
increases in reported side effects were noted in subjects
supplementing with creatine—either competitive athletes or recreationally trained individuals (60, 103, 151).

Caffeine
Caffeine is a multifaceted supplement used in athletics
and is popular among both endurance and resistance
training athletes. It is found in coffee, tea, soft drinks,
chocolate, and various other foods. It is a central ner-

vous system stimulant, and its effects are similar to,
yet weaker than, those associated with amphetamines.
Caffeine has been used as a performance enhancer for
more than 40 years and is one of the few ergogenic aids
that may be used comparably by aerobic and anaerobic
athletes.
The mechanism to explain endurance improvements
is unclear. One of the mechanisms that has been proposed involves an increase in fat oxidation through the
mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue or
intramuscular fat stores (215). The greater use of fat as
a primary energy source slows glycogen depletion and
delays fatigue. Alterations in muscle metabolism alone
cannot fully explain the ergogenic effect of caffeine.
During short-duration, high-intensity exercise, the
primary ergogenic effect attributed to caffeine supple-


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Method

mentation is enhanced power production. This is thought
to be the result of an enhanced excitation—contraction
coupling, affecting neuromuscular transmission and
mobilization of intracellular calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (227). In addition, caffeine ingestion is
thought to enhance the kinetics of glycolytic regulatory
enzymes such as phosphorylase (215).

Efficacy For the aerobic athlete, caffeine is thought to
prolong aerobic endurance exercise (56). Initial studies
dealing with the effect of caffeine supplementation on
aerobic endurance performance indicated a 21-minute
improvement in the time to exhaustion (from 75 minutes
in a placebo trial to 96 minutes in the caffeine trial)
during cycling at 80% of VO,max (56). These results
were confirmed by a number of additional studies
demonstrating the ergogenic effect of caffeine during
prolonged aerobic endurance activity (101, 216). These
studies showed that caffeine in doses ranging from 3 to
9 mg/kg (equivalent to approximately 1.5 to 3.5 cups of
automatic drip coffee in a 70 kg [154-pound] person)
produced a significant ergogenic effect. Similar performance effects from caffeine have also been demonstrated
during short-duration, high-intensity exercise (38, 67).
When the effects of caffeine ingestion on sprint
or power performance are examined, however, the
ergogenic benefits become less clear. Several studies
have shown that caffeine ingestion does not improve
power performance (52, 105), but those studies used
recreational athletes. In elite Judo athletes ingesting
caffeine (5 mg/kg), it was reported that peak power was
significantly improved in comparison with a placebo
treatment (213).
Similarly, in competitive swimmers, caffeine ingestion (250 mg) was shown to improve sprint times during
repeated 100 m sprints by an average of 3% (53). The
number of studies on caffeine ingestion and sprint and
power performance is limited compared to the number
that measured caffeine’s effect on aerobic endurance
performance. Thus, the results of the studies on the
ergogenic benefit of caffeine for power performance
are inconclusive. If there is any performance benefit, it
likely occurs in the trained athlete.
Caffeine from a food source (coffee consumption)
and anhydrous caffeine have both shown significant

performance effects; however, the extent of performance
improvements appears to be greater when caffeine is
ingested in tablet form (101). When caffeine is provided
as a pure caffeine supplement, the ergogenic benefit with
respect to improved aerobic endurance performance has
been reported to range between 28% and 43% (101).
However, when it is provided in a food source such
as coffee (either caffeinated coffee or decaffeinated
coffee with added caffeine), the ergogenic benefit for
aerobic endurance exercise may not be seen (46, 101)

or may be seen only at a reduced level (56, 236, 253).
Graham and colleagues (101) suggested that although the
bioavailability of caffeine is the same whether it is consumed in a food source or in an anhydrous form, some
compound in coffee antagonizes the action ofcaffeine.
In doses of 3 to 9 mg/kg body weight
consumed ~60 minutes before exercise or
during prolonged exercise, caffeine is ergogenic. There is no further benefit when it is
consumed at higher dosages (>9 mg/kg).
It can decrease feelings of perceived exertion, improve work capacity, and increase
mental alertness. The scientific literature
does not support caffeine-induced diuresis
during exercise or any harmful change in
fluid balance that would negatively affect
performance.

Adverse Effects

The side effects associated with

caffeine include anxiety, gastrointestinal disturbances,
restlessness, insomnia, tremors, and heart arrhythmias.

Caffeine is also physically addicting, and discontinuation
can result in some withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, fatigue, dysphoric mood, difficulty concentrating,
and flu-like somatic symptoms (222). Caffeine intakes
greater than 9 mg/kg appear to result in a greater risk
for side effects (98). Caffeine overdose is an issue that
can have potentially fatal consequences. A lethal dose
of caffeine is typically in excess of 5 g, which equates
to about 42 cups of coffee at 120 mg of caffeine per cup
(143) or twenty-five 200 mg tablets of caffeine.

Preworkout Energy Drinks
Consumption of preworkout caffeine-containing liquid
beverages (i.e., energy drinks) has gained in popularity
over the past several years. Research has demonstrated
that energy drinks are among the most popular dietary
supplements consumed by young people in the United
States (90). The primary reasons for ingesting energy
drinks include enhancing workouts, improving sport
performance, and facilitating faster training adaptations
(188). The ingredients most common to commercially
available energy drinks are caffeine, carbohydrates, B
vitamins, tyrosine, and gingko biloba, among others.

Of these ingredients, caffeine and carbohydrate are the
primary ergogenic nutrients in energy drinks (43).

Efficacy

Preworkout energy drinks have been

investigated for their effectiveness on several modes
of exercise, including resistance exercise, anaerobic
exercise, and aerobic endurance exercise. In relation to

resistance exercise performance, Forbes and colleagues
(83) gave 15 physically active college-aged students a
commercially available energy drink or an isocaloric




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

noncaffeinated placebo 60 minutes before exercise. The
energy drink was standardized with 2 mg of caffeine/
kg body mass. The exercise bout consisted of three sets
of 70% 1RM bench press conducted to failure on each
set with | minute of rest between each set. The energy
drink significantly increased bench press performance
as compared to the placebo treatment. Other studies
investigating the effects of preworkout energy drink
consumption have also reported improvements in upper
and lower body total lifting volume (63, 100). While
it appears that preworkout energy drink ingestion is
effective for increasing resistance training volume performance, other types of anaerobic exercise (including
Wingate tests and speed/agility performance) are not
as responsive to energy drink consumption (11, 83,
118). In terms of endurance exercise performance,
most investigations (4, 134, 249), but not all (44), have
reported that energy drinks containing approximately
2 mg of caffeine/kg body mass, consumed within an
hour before exercise, improve cycling and running performance in trained cyclists and recreationally active
individuals (43). Interestingly, the amount of caffeine (2
mg/kg body mass) in the energy drinks is less than the
amount recommended for an enhancement of exercise
performance (3-9 mg/kg body mass). This contributes to
the hypothesis that the synergistic effects of the various
ingredients in energy drinks may be responsible for the
reported improvements in exercise performance (43).

Adverse Effects

The safety issues surrounding energy

drink consumption appear related to excessive caffeine
intake (209) and the detrimental effects of mixing energy
drinks with alcohol (127). The mixing of energy drinks
with alcohol is more prevalent in certain social contexts
and is not a common practice for those consuming energy
drinks before a workout to enhance work capacity or to
facilitate faster training adaptations. Due to the presence
of caffeine in most energy drinks, the same potential
adverse effects that exist for caffeine also exist for
energy drinks. However, most energy drinks contain only
moderate amounts of caffeine, typically less than 300
mg (234). Even though energy drinks typically contain
low to moderate doses of caffeine, one should recognize
that it is possible to overdose on caffeine through the
consumption of energy drinks (124). While there is some
information related to the side effects of excess caffeine
ingestion, energy drinks contain other ingredients and
stimulants. Currently, it is unknown whether inclusion
of other stimulants in energy drinks may increase or
decrease the threshold for experiencing side effects.
Therefore, more research is needed to determine the
long-term effects of habitual intake of energy drinks
before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Ephedrine
Another stimulant, ephedrine, has been widely used

throughout the world for temporary relief from the symptoms of bronchial asthma, bronchitis, allergies, shortness

of breath, cold and flu symptoms, and other ailments.
Ephedrine is also very popular among bodybuilders due
to its strong thermogenic quality (41). A thermogenic
supplement or drug works by elevating basal metabolic
rate, thereby increasing energy expenditure and ultimately resulting in fat loss. It often is used as a stacking
agent with caffeine to enhance the thermogenic effect.

Efficacy

Studies examining the ergogenic effect of

ephedrine have shown it to be effective only when it is
taken in combination with caffeine (21). These results
have been quite consistent with regard to improving
aerobic endurance performance (19, 20). In terms of
anaerobic exercise performance, the scientific literature
investigating the combination of ephedrine and caffeine
is equivocal (137, 254). However, side effects (vomiting and nausea) following exercise have been reported
in 25% of the subjects ingesting a mixture of 5 mg/kg
caffeine and 1 mg/kg ephedrine (19). A subsequent study
performed by the same investigators showed that at a
lower dose (4 mg/kg caffeine and 0.8 mg/kg ephedrine),
similar ergogenic benefits were realized with no side
effects (20). The caffeine—ephedrine mixture appears
to have a greater benefit than either supplement taken
alone (12).

Adverse Effects Ephedra, also called ma huang, is
a plant that contains ephedrine. In the United States
before 2004, most over-the-counter sport and weight loss
products contained ephedra. However, in April 2004, the
FDA banned all products containing ephedra after determining that it posed an unreasonable risk to those who
used it. The FDA ban was based on a report published by
the Rand Institute (210) indicating that 16,000 adverse
events were linked to the use of ephedra-containing
dietary supplements. Further, Shekelle and colleagues
(210) reported that the use of ephedra-containing dietary
supplements or ephedrine plus caffeine was associated
with an increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and change in mood,
autonomic hyperactivity, palpitations, and in a few cases
death. As a result of the many adverse effects, ephedrine
use has been banned by most sport governing bodies,
including the International Olympic Committee.

Citrus Aurantium
Citrus aurantium is from a fruit commonly known as
“bitter orange” and is often used as an Asian herbal
medicine to treat digestive problems (92, 107). However,


Performance-Enhancing Substances and Methods

Summary of Ergogenic and Non-Ergogenic Dietary Supplements
and Their Application
Essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids—Ability to stimulate muscle protein synthesis,
particularly via the anabolic effects of the amino acid leucine.
Arginine—Not effective for inducing nitric oxide or muscle blood flow in healthy individuals. Also, does not
appear to have any effect on improving endurance performance in healthy populations.
B-Hydroxy-B-methylbutyrate (HMB)—Most effective for trained individuals participating in a high-intensity,
high-volume resistance training program.
B-Alanine—Effective as a performance-enhancing substance in exercises inducing a high level of lactic acid,
such as multiple bouts of high-intensity exercises lasting more than 60 seconds.
Sodium bicarbonate—Has been shown to improve high-intensity exercise performance and training, but is
associated with unpleasant side effects consistent with gastrointestinal discomfort.
Sodium citrate—The scientific data are not conclusive in relation to sodium citrate’s ergogenic potential
during short-duration, high-intensity exercise.
L-carnitine—May enhance recovery following high-intensity resistance exercise.
Creatine—Effective for increasing maximal strength, power, and lean body mass in both trained and untrained
populations.
Caffeine—Effective for prolonging endurance exercise, but its effects on sprint or power performance are
less clear.
Preworkout energy drinks-—Effective for increasing resistance training volume performance and endurance
performance, but not ergogenic in their ability to improve anaerobic exercise (high-intensity cycling and
speed/agility performance).

Ephedrine—When combined with caffeine, is able to improve aerobic endurance performance. Not as
effective in improving anaerobic exercise performance.
Citrus aurantium—When combined with caffeine and other herbal products, improvements in exercise time
to fatigue (a measure of endurance performance) have been reported.

it is also a mild stimulant and is thought to contribute to
appetite suppression and increased metabolic rate and
lipolysis (92, 107).

Efficacy
When citrus aurantium is combined with caffeine and
other herbal products, significant improvements in time
to fatigue have been reported (220). Citrus aurantium
contains synephrine, a sympathomimetic agent, which
some have suggested stimulates specific beta adrenergic
receptors (8-3, but not B-1 or 8-2) that in turn stimulate
fat metabolism without any of the negative side effects
generally associated with compounds that stimulate the
other adrenergic receptors (45). Synephrine, a known
active component of citrus aurantium, is thought to
interact with B-3 receptors to increase lipolysis (i.e., the
breakdown of body fat) and minimize the cardiovascular effect typical of adrenergic amines (45). Currently,
there are not enough published data on citrus aurantium
alone to recommend its use as a performance-enhancing
supplement.

Adverse Effects
Synephrine has been shown to stimulate peripheral a-1
receptors, resulting in vasoconstriction and elevations in
blood pressure (35). However, other research has shown

that when citrus aurantium is ingested alone, no effect
on blood pressure is seen (109), but in combination with

other herbal products it may cause significant elevations
in systolic blood pressure (109, 119). It should be noted
that synephrine is currently on the National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s banned list of performanceenhancing drugs.

Conclusion
Athletes are frequently exposed to information about
ergogenic aids. Strength and conditioning professionals
play an integral part in the decision-making process
regarding which ergogenic aids athletes choose to take.
Therefore, it is imperative that strength and conditioning
professions stay up to date on the latest scientific findings
in relation to what ergogenic aids are safe, effective, and
legal. If strength and conditioning professionals fail in
this area, the athletes they serve will be more susceptible to hyped marketing, potentially false advertising,
and influence by others who may not have the athlete’s
best interests in mind. The information contained in this
chapter serves the strength and conditioning professional
by providing fundamental information on performanceenhancing substances, including which substances are
banned, effective or noneffective, and safe.
