Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

This chapter addresses the development of speed,
change-of-direction, and agility abilities. Although the
term speed is often used when an athlete displays one
or all of these aspects of physical performance, it is
critical to understand that athlete development requires
various underpinning physical capacities and skills as a
result of differing biomechanical requirements. These
three important aspects of physical performance can be
defined as follows:
¢ Speed—the skills and abilities needed to achieve
high movement velocities
* Change of direction—the skills and abilities
needed to explosively change movement direction, velocities, or modes

¢ Agility—the skills and abilities needed to change
direction, velocity, or mode in response to a
stimulus
The ability to outrun the competition is a hallmark of
most athletic endeavors. Further, the ability to change
direction rapidly during an activity can mute the effect
of an opponent’s speed or provide both physical and
tactical advantages on the field of play. Although 1t may
seem that these scenarios all involve the “speed” of an
athlete, this perceived “speed” may be a result of one
quality or a combination of the three qualities just listed.
Within sport, high-speed human locomotion can be categorized as linear or multidirectional. Generating high
speeds linearly, more commonly referred to as sprinting,
is the underlying requirement for success in many track
and field events as well as open-field running in gamebased contexts. While linear speed is important in team
sports, play is primarily multidirectional. As a result,
these athletes’ success partially depends on responding
to ever-changing game scenarios through fast, efficient
changes of direction whereas speed requires the ability
to accelerate and reach maximal velocity.
Because of the nature of most sports, there are scenarios in which athletes have a predetermined change
of direction to make and they are limited only by their
physical capacity to perform this activity (e.g., a route,
play, or predetermined pattern). The physical capacity
to change direction while decelerating and then reaccelerating, sometimes using a different mode of travel,
is change-of-direction ability, whereas agility requires
the use of perceptual—cognitive ability in combination
with change-of-direction ability. This highlights the
similar and contrasting qualities of speed, change of
direction, and agility. For example, acceleration is a part
of change-of-direction ability and agility, but additional
aspects such as deceleration ability and mode of movement differentiate the training for speed from the training
for change of direction and agility. The physical capacity
to change direction may be a component of agility, but

the perceptual-cognitive component influences the
physical demands of agility. Therefore, while reading
this chapter, one should understand that although there is
overlap between these qualities, differing physical, technical, or perceptual—cognitive development is required to
improve each of these aspects of physical performance.
When athletes are sprinting or changing direction,
their performance is a function of physical capacity and
technical proficiency. While biomechanical and metabolic efficiency underpin performance in aerobic sport,
effective application of force limits speed, change of
direction, and agility. Simply put, an athlete’s success in
these explosive movements is the product of an athlete’s
strength capacity combined with the ability to use this
strength within the constraints of the activity. Strength
is often associated with an athlete’s capacity to produce
force, but it is important to understand that while high
levels of maximal strength are desirable attributes in
sport, sprint, change-of-direction, and agility events
occur in periods that prevent athletes from producing
and expressing their maximal strength.
Within sprinting, the application of force allows the
athlete to accelerate, attain high velocities, and attempt
to maintain the high velocities. In addition to the force
application associated with acceleration and attainment
of velocity in sprinting, change-of-direction ability
requires effective application of force to decelerate
and then reaccelerate in another direction. Further still,

agility performance is considered a function of the
athlete’s ability not only to change direction, but also
specifically to change direction in response to a stimulus
(4) such as a defender or ball. For this reason, strength
and conditioning professionals must be aware of their
training choices regarding the development of physical
characteristics that assist in promoting speed, change
of direction, and agility on both the track and the field.
Speed requires the ability to accelerate and
reach maximal velocity, whereas agility
performance requires the use of perceptualcognitive ability in combination with the
ability to decelerate and then reaccelerate
in an intended direction.

Speed and Agility Mechanics
In order to execute movement techniques, athletes must
apply force—the product of mass and acceleration. Due
to the limited available time to produce force during most
athletic activities, there are two variables that describe
force relative to the time available to produce force:

* Rate of force development (RFD)—the development of maximal force in minimal time, typically
used as an index of explosive strength (3)


Program Design and Technique for Speed

* Impulse—the product of the generated force
and the time required for its production, which is

measured as the area under the force-time curve.
According to the impulse-momentum relationship, impulse dictates the magnitude of change
of momentum of an object.

Physics of Sprinting, Change
of Direction, and Agility

and Agility Training

a physical object, the mass will change direction and
leave the space it was occupying. Acceleration of the
object will continue as long as external forces continue
to change velocity. In practical settings, deceleration
replaces negative acceleration in describing a change
from higher to lower velocity.

Rate of Force Development

Force represents the interaction of two physical objects.
Force is a vector quantity, meaning that it has both
magnitude (size) and direction. Traditionally, force is
described as a push or a pull exerted on one object by
another, which prevents both objects from occupying the
same space. This movement of mass changes an object’s
velocity, causing acceleration.
Within the strength and conditioning profession,
velocity and speed are often used interchangeably. For
a proper discussion on sprint and agility performance,
these terms need to be separated. Speed is a scalar quantity, which means that it describes only how fast an object
is moving. Speed is the rate at which an object covers
a distance. Like force, velocity is a vector quantity.
Velocity describes both how fast an object is traveling
and its direction. In short, velocity is speed with a
direction.
Acceleration refers to the rate at which an object’s
velocity changes over time. Once a force acts upon

Within the sporting context, the ability to produce force
rapidly is arguably a more desirable trait than maximal
force production (89). While the ability to generate high
levels of maximal force has been shown to improve
performance in jump height and other athletic measures,
most competitive scenarios do not occur within a time
frame that allows an athlete to generate maximal forces
(19). Specifically, the generation of maximal contraction
force takes at least 300 ms, while many sport activities
consume () to 200 ms (see figure 19.1) (1). For this
reason, in sport settings where success is restricted to
timing of movement, RFD may be a more useful measure of an athlete’s explosive ability (5). Rate of force
development can be described as the change in force
divided by the change in time (89).
The ability to accelerate a mass depends on a change
in velocity resulting from the application of an external
force. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, an athlete
wishing to achieve higher acceleration capabilities
should apply forces at a greater rate (73).

product of force and time (represented by the area under each curve), and is increased by improving RFD. When
functional movements are performed, force is typically applied very briefly —often for 0.1 to 0.2 seconds—whereas
absolute maximum force development may require 0.6 to 0.8 seconds.

Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Impulse
In order for an object to change its location, forces must
be applied to produce a change in velocity. Athletes
attempting to increase speeds through the production of
force never apply forces instantaneously. In fact, force
is applied to the running surface over a period of time in
the stance phase of sprinting (figure 19.2) or in the plant
phase of changing direction. The length of time athletes
are in this stance or plant phase is termed their ground
contact time. The product of the time the force is applied
to the ground and the amount of force applied is termed
impulse and can be graphically represented as the area
under a force-time curve. Changes in impulse result in
changes of the athlete’s momentum and therefore the
ability to either accelerate or decelerate.
Figure 19.2 demonstrates how the vertical and horizontal forces differ in magnitude when the acceleration

phase (figure 19.7, later in the chapter) is compared to
the maximal-velocity phase (figure 19.8), which reflects
the two different body positions used to produce force
through maximal extension. Further, these two diagrams
demonstrate the concept of impulse (represented as the
area under the force-time curve) during the braking
phase, indicated by a negative horizontal force, or
during the propulsive phase that occurs where there is
a positive horizontal force. These two phases of impulse
are indicated by the vertical dotted line. It should be
noted that during maximal-velocity phases, there is an
asymmetrical production of force and the RFD is very
high, resulting in much shorter ground contact times in
comparison to the acceleration phase.
Momentum is defined as the relationship between
the mass of an object and the velocity of movement.
During a sprint, an athlete’s body mass remains constant. Thus, given the same time frame, the only way to
achieve a greater impulse is to generate greater force.
This increase in impulse leads to an increase in momentum or a decrease in momentum, depending on whether
the athlete is intending to accelerate or reaccelerate or
decelerate before a change of direction. In other words,
a change in impulse results in a change in momentum
and is the cause of an object’s movement.

coupled with the length of time the force is produced
during an individual step is paramount to success.
Changes in these forces can increase or decrease the athlete’s momentum. For this reason, training should focus
on impulse—the area under the force-time curve—in
addition to RFD.
Power has not been discussed here because it is
derived from force and velocity. Therefore, power is
considered a mechanical construct that does not truly
indicate maximal explosive performance (32). Practically speaking, a power value does not give insight into
the performance in a way that is fully useful to professionals, because it is unclear whether a power value has
been achieved as a result of the force or of the velocity.
In understanding that force, RFD, and impulse are direct
measures, one does not require a more complex derived
value to gain additional insight.

FIGURE 19.2 Sprint ground reaction force and impulse
during the (a) acceleration phase and (b) maximalvelocity phase. W, = body weight.

In order to displace their body mass down a track or field,
athletes must produce forces sufficient to overcome the
effects of gravity and create a positive change in velocity. Within a short sprint, force is the effort needed to
accelerate an athlete up to his or her highest achievable
speeds, which are largely determined by physiological
factors. These forces or efforts are produced rapidly,
with time constraints that are often shorter than the time
needed for maximal voluntary force production. For this


Program Design and Technique

reason, rate of force production may be a more important
factor for sprinting success. Moreover, since sprinting
success is largely dependent on the production of forces
within a short amount of time, impulse is an important
underlying factor.

Practical Implications for Change of
Direction and Agility
In addition to the requirement for acceleration, the production of braking forces over certain periods of time,
termed braking impulse, should be considered during
change-of-direction and agility maneuvers. The amount
of impulse required to change momentum effectively
and efficiently is a direct reflection of the physical
requirements for change of direction. For example, as

the angle of directional change required or the velocity
of entry into the change of direction increases, so does
the impulse required to change momentum; therefore it
is physically more demanding to perform such activities.
Further, the time restraints placed on a performer due to
the perceptual—cognitive aspects of agility can influence
the physical demands by limiting the time available to
produce the required force (and impulse) to successfully
change direction in response to a stimulus.

Neurophysiological
Basis for Speed
Sprinting, agility, and change of direction are all dynamic
displays of force production in the athletic setting.
Because strength and conditioning professionals are
often asked to assist in the development of these competitively advantageous qualities, an overview of how
these force measures are produced during movement is
warranted.

Nervous System
Neuromuscular function is vital to sprint performance,
because the activity and the interaction of the central
nervous system with the muscles ultimately influence
the rate and strength of muscle contraction. Research has
shown that the combination of strength, plyometric, and
sprint training produces several adaptations within the
neuromuscular system that may contribute to improved
sprint performance. Strength training enhances neural
drive, the rate and amplitude of impulses being sent
from the nervous system to the target muscles (1).
Increases in neural drive, which are indicative of an
increase in the rate at which action potentials occur, are
related to increases in both muscular force production
and the rate of force production. Similarly, plyometric
training demonstrates increases in excitability of high-

and

Agility Training

threshold motor neurons. Increased excitability ultimately enhances neural drive. Taken together, increases
in neural drive may contribute to increases in the athlete’s
RFD and impulse generation.

Stretch--Shortening Cycle
Many functional tasks begin with preparatory countermovements involving spring-like actions referred to as
the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC)—an eccentric—concentric coupling phenomenon in which muscle-tendon
complexes are rapidly and forcibly lengthened, or stretch
loaded, and immediately shortened in a reactive or elastic
manner. Practically speaking, the SSC is demonstrated in
movements in which a rapid transition from an eccentric
action to a concentric action occurs. Therefore, SSC
actions are particularly prevalent in sports involving
running, jumping, and other explosive changes in
velocity. Their performance is a distinct capability that
is independent of maximal strength in elite athletes (35,
45, 46, 71, 72, 80, 87, 99).
Stretch—shortening cycle actions exploit two phenomena: (1) intrinsic muscle—tendon behavior and (2)
force and length reflex feedback to the nervous system
(3, 4, 9, 14, 25). Acutely, SSC actions tend to increase

mechanical efficiency and impulse via elastic energy
recovery, whereas chronically, they upregulate muscle
stiffness and enhance neuromuscular activation (35, 45,

46, 71, 72).
Training activities aimed at improving SSC performance should fulfill two criteria (36, 71, 72, 80, 87):

¢ They should involve skillful, multijoint movements that transmit forces through the kinetic
chain and exploit elastic-reflexive mechanisms.
¢ In order to manage fatigue and emphasize work
quality and technique, they should be structured
around brief work bouts or clusters separated by
frequent rest pauses.

In practice, a combination of progressive plyometric
and heavy resistance methods can accomplish these
objectives. An intriguing example of this strategy is
complex training, in which alternating SSC tasks with
heavy resistance exercises within the same session
enhances their working effect. The basis of this method
is an acute aftereffect phenomenon referred to as
postactivation potentiation (37, 66, 69). This training
modality is becoming increasingly popular as a means
of enhancing advanced athletes’ performance but may
be inappropriate for novices or youths.

Spring—Mass Model
Exposure to strength and speed training may be linked
to a rise in the preactivation of the musculature used

in sprinting (43, 46). The onset of pre-tension may be
related to an increase in the sensitivity of associated
muscle spindles. The improvement in the time needed
for feedback from muscle spindles results in greater
muscle stiffness and tendon compliance (44, 48, 68).
This physiological condition provides support to the
SSC, which underpins the spring—mass model (SMM).
The SMM (figure 19.3) is a mathematical model that
depicts sprinting as a type of human locomotion in which
the displacement of a body mass is the aftereffect from
energy produced and is delivered through the collective coiling and extension of spring-like actions within
muscle architecture (10, 21, 27, 29). During a complete

running speed, one of the most important features of the
leg spring is an increase in muscle stiffness (29).

running cycle, one spring compresses and propels the
sprinter’s body forward. Simultaneously, the other spring
swings forward in preparation for ground contact.
Within an upright sprint, compression of the spring
begins at foot strike, resulting in horizontal braking
forces. This sudden and brief deceleration assists in
propelling the swing leg forward in preparation for the
subsequent step. As the center of mass moves ahead of
the foot, the sprinter is in midstance. Within the SMM,
the spring is compressed to the lowest point, which coincides with a lowered center of mass at midstance. Finally,
the model describes the push-off segment of the stance
phase as the return of energy through the extension of
the coiled spring. This resultant energy and return of
force projects the sprinter forward.
While the SMM provides a conceptual framework for
highlighting the actions involved in upright high-speed
running, recent investigations suggest that there are limitations to the model’s ability to describe the stance phase
of elite sprinters. As illustrated in figure 19.2, during the
maximal-velocity phase, elite sprinters tend to deviate
from a classic SMM by producing much of their vertical
force in the first half of a ground contact. In contrast,
most nonelite sprinters, such as those involved in many
team or field-based sports, display stance phases that
are described by the SMM (17), where the vertical force
curve is more symmetrical, as shown in figure 19.3. As

Additional Neurophysiological
Considerations for Change-of-Direction
and Agility Development
In addition to the neurophysiological aspects of speed
performance previously discussed, there are other factors to consider with regard to change-of-direction and
agility performance. During the plant phase, depicted in
figure 19.4, the length of ground contact time of either
an agility (0.23 to 0.25 seconds) (7) or a change-of-direction movement (0.44 to 0.722 seconds) (8, 39, 54)
exceeds the typical ground contact time of both the
acceleration phase of sprinting (0.17 to 0.2 seconds)


Program Design and Technique for Speed and Agility Training

neurophysiological requirements of agility performance
extend beyond physical requirements to perceptual—
cognitive requirements that are specific to the tactical
situation.

Running Speed

FIGURE 19.4 Plant phase, termed stance phase in the
context of sprinting, of a change-of-direction movement.
This is the point in a change-of-direction movement that
represents the transition between the deceleration step
and the acceleration step. Body positioning and the ability to maintain strong trunk positions during the deceleration of momentum and reorientation of the body
to run in a new direction are critical for performance.

(4) and the maximal-velocity phase of sprinting (0.09
to 0.11 seconds) (92, 93). In view of this, most change
of direction requires longer SSC activities.
Since effective braking is an important part of agility performance (83, 84), neuromuscular development
with respect to high-velocity and high-force eccentric
contractions should be considered, for two reasons.

First, the adaptations or motor unit recruitment pathways called upon during an eccentric contraction are
different than those called upon during concentric
contractions (28). Secondly, the adaptations to eccentric training appear to be specific to the velocity of
eccentric loading (62). In addition, training athletes for
effective agility performance requires knowledge of
perceptual—cognitive demands over and above the neurophysiological requirements for changing direction. Not
only are the perceptual—cognitive demands on athletes
related to their abilities in the areas of visual search
scanning, anticipation, decision making, and reaction
time (76), but also the tactical situation (offensive vs.
defensive) changes the brain processing strategy required
(82, 85).
The training required to improve agility becomes
clearer as one begins to understand the various demands
required for change of direction and agility with respect
to neurophysiological factors, including the SSC,
eccentric muscle action neuromuscular training, and
implications of the length of time or the demand of the
change-of-direction maneuver on the SMM. Further,

Sprinting is a series of coupled flight and support
phases, known as strides, orchestrated in an attempt to
displace the athlete’s body down the track at maximal
acceleration or velocity (or both), usually over brief
distances and durations. Sprinting has been described as
rapid, unpaced, maximal-effort running of 15 seconds
or less (67). However, the classic definition of sprint
speed concerns the relationship between stride length
and stride frequency (53).
Based on this understanding, sprint speed can be
increased by an increase in stride length or an increase
in stride frequency (figure 19.5). Although these changes
in performance variables are logical, the underlying component to maximizing stride length and stride frequency
is related to rapid force production.
* The differences between elite and novice sprinters
can be traced to a single component. Much ofthe
current literature on sprinting (13, 52, 93, 94)
suggests that the amount of vertical force applied
to the ground during the stance phase may be
the most critical component to improving speed.
In addition, these greater forces must be applied
to the ground in the shortest period possible
(RFD).

* Application of force is needed to displace a mass.
In sprinting, stride length represents the displacement of mass. Elite male sprinters achieve a stride
length of 2.70 m, whereas novice sprinters display
a stride length of 2.56 m at maximum velocity
(figure 19.6a) (52).
¢ Since contact with the ground is needed to continue force production and subsequent alterations
in velocity, increasing the stride rate would theoretically maximize the time available to produce
force. Elite male sprinters demonstrate stride rates
near 4.63 steps per second compared to novice
sprinters, who produce a lesser stride rate of 4.43
steps per second (figure 19.65) (52). In other
words, an elite sprinter needs less ground contact
time to exert the effort needed to displace his or
her mass. Thus these faster sprinters spend more
time in the air due to their more frequent stride
rate. Interestingly, elite sprinters display times to
reposition the swing leg that are similar to those
of their slower counterparts (52, 94).

forces. Mann (52) suggests that these vertical forces
are better directed toward the track due to an optimized
knee height at maximal flexion of the recovering leg.
This higher knee position provides a greater time period
for force production and subsequent ground clearance.
This technical advantage may be further evidence for
why elite sprinters tend to produce most of their force
within the first half of the stance phase.
In addition, faster sprinters are able to achieve higher
velocities through the continuous application of high
forces in a short stance phase, which results in longer
strides occurring at a higher rate. Within the elite setting,
this results in male sprinters achieving velocities near
12.55 m/s, whereas novices are limited to 11.25 m/s.

While force production is arguably the limiting factor,
technical efficiency and properly designed training also
limit sprint speed.

Sprint speed is determined by an athlete’s
stride length and stride rate; more successful
sprinters tend to have longer stride lengths
as a result of properly directed forces into
the ground while also demonstrating a more
frequent stride rate. These findings suggest
that RFD and proper biomechanics are two
of the primary limiting factors influencing
sprint performance.

Linear sprinting is composed of a series of subtasks that
can be divided into the start, acceleration (figure 19.7),
and top speed (figure 19.8). While these phases of a

are based on linear sprinting and may be useful for both
instruction and evaluation of the movements. Figure
19.10 describes the fundamental movements occurring
in maximum-velocity sprinting.

Technical Errors and Coaching
Table 19.1 highlights many common sprinting errors as
well as possible causes and coaching corrections. Quite
often, these errors are the result of the misapplication
of forces due to improper coaching cues, insufficient
mobility, or disruption to an athlete’s normal gait caused
by external interference. For instance, an athlete may
demonstrate overstriding due to a coaching drill (such as
reaching to successively longer marks along the track in
order to gain speed) or the belief that acutely increasing
stride length will allow one to “catch up” to a competitor

in a race. Regardless of the reason, the aim of coaches
should be to promote an athlete’s speed through the
proper transmission of forces into the ground that will
optimize the athlete’s gait cycle.

Training Goals
The overarching goal of sprinting is to achieve optimal
stride length and stride frequency through the correct
application of force into the ground. The transmission
of high forces must occur within a short stance phase,
also known as ground contact time. During the acceleration phase, propulsive forces assist in elevating the
hips above the ground to a point at which speed is no
longer increasing at large rates. This portion of the sprint,
known as maximum velocity, uses the SSC (through
stiffness regulation) to propel the athlete’s center of mass
down the track horizontally.
The following fundamental training objectives
regarding performance enhancement and injury prevention should be considered during the development
of speed in practical settings:

Emphasize brief ground support times as a means
of achieving rapid stride rate. As previously

Factors Affecting Change of Direction
and Perceptual—Cognitive Ability

Agility Performance and
Change-of-Direction Ability

It is becoming increasingly clear that the ground contact
time and ground reaction force during the plant phase
(figure 19.4) of a movement provide valuable insight
into the physical factors that affect change-of-direction
performance, while perceptual—cognitive factors must
also be considered with regard to agility. Change-of-direction and agility movements performed at shallow
cutting angles (less than 75°) and associated with shorter
ground contact times (less than 250 ms) (83) will benefit
from training similar to speed training with regard to
the physical demands but will still require additional
perceptual—cognitive training. On the other hand, when
a change of direction involves a more aggressive cutting angle (equal to or greater than 75°), the length of
ground contact time can often exceed 250 ms (8, 38,
54) due to the greater braking requirements. Therefore,
one should consider increasing emphasis on eccentric
strength and maximal strength alongside the concentric
explosiveness required during the reacceleration. Figure
19.11 provides an example of how various requirements
(angle of change of direction or perceptual—cognitive
requirement of agility) may affect the ground reaction
force and ground contact times of athletes. Of particular
interest is the effect of various methods of changing
direction (for the same-degree cut) on ground reaction
force and ground contact times. The effect of method
of changing direction can be seen in figure 19.11: The

In both field and court sports, there are a substantial
number of preplanned change-of-direction movements
as well as changes in direction in response to the ball, the
game, or opponents. In sports such as baseball, softball,
American football, and basketball, athletes decide before
commencement of movement on the path they will run.
Such patterns often including a quick or sudden change
of direction—for example, exploding into a sprint out
of a shuffle off a base or running a route before receipt
of a ball. However, many sports also include rapid
changes of direction in response to opponents or tactical
situations. Such responses can occur in an offensive or
a defensive scenario, and the physical movement and
perceptual—cognitive aspects of such performances
impose different demands on the athlete. Therefore,
one should thoroughly understand the factors associated
with agility performance from a physical standpoint
Athletes improve change-of-direction ability through development of a number of
physical factors and technical skills during a
variety of speeds and modes of movement.
The development of agility also requires
improving perceptual—cognitive abilities in

to decelerate, hold body position, and then reaccelerate

Body Position During Braking and Reacceleration

is important in change-of-direction tasks as described
by the kinetic and kinematic requirements of faster
change-of-direction and agility performances, it is clear
that a well-rounded approach to strength development
involving dynamic, isometric, and in particular eccentric strength capacities is needed for the development
of better change-of-direction performances (41, 86).
In contrast to sprint development, it is recommended
that athletes undergo training that allows for the neuromuscular system to effectively adapt to the rate of
loading required during the braking phase, with the
understanding that the neuromuscular requirements
for braking capacity must be specifically trained using
high-velocity eccentric contractions (28) such as those
during drop landings, landing from a loaded jump, or
the catch phase of a power clean or power snatch. All of
these place different eccentric loading demands on the
hips, knees, and ankles (56).

Perceptual—Cognitive Ability
When the physical ability to change direction rapidly is
present, one can focus on the components of perceptual—
cognitive ability that must be developed to bring together
the ability to perform both physically and mentally on
the field of play. There are several components of perceptual-cognitive ability: visual scanning, anticipation,
pattern recognition, knowledge of the situation, decisionmaking time and accuracy, and reaction time (75, 77,
83, 97, 98). Many of these aspects of development
are sport specific, and a comprehensive discussion is
beyond the scope of this text. However, general drills
to help improve these skills are discussed in the section
on methods of developing agility.

In comparison to sprinting, change of direction and
agility have a large number of degrees of freedom due to
the multitude of movements that occur during a change
of direction. Further, agility performance as restricted
or determined by opponents or other tactical restraints
and scenarios cannot be trained through the use of a
single technique. Nevertheless, the following are some
technical guidelines and coaching suggestions.
Visual Focus

¢ When changing direction in response to an opponent (either offensive or defensive), the athlete
should focus on the shoulders, trunk, and hip.

* Following the anticipation of the event, unless
deception is intended, the athlete should quickly
redirect attention to a new area to help lead the
transition of the body.

¢ Control the trunk leading into the deceleration
(decrease large amounts of trunk motion) (70).

¢ Through the stance phase, reorient the trunk and
hips toward the direction of intended travel to
allow for a more effective reacceleration (15).

¢ Just as with acceleration mechanics, body lean is
paramount in allowing proper force application
through the ground with strong alignment of the
ankle, knee, and hip and through to the trunk and
shoulders.
¢ Enter and exit changes in direction with a lower
center of mass; when performing side-shuffling
changes of direction, maintaining this low center
of mass is critical (78).

Leg Action

¢ Ensure that the athlete can effectively dissipate
or tolerate the eccentric braking loads through an
effective range of motion at the knee and avoid a
stiff-legged braking style (81, 83).
¢ Emphasize “pushing the ground away” in order to
enhance performance, especially while learning in
closed drills. External focus of attention—through
instructions to concentrate on the ground instead
of a body part—has been shown to improve
change-of-direction performance (64).
Arm Action
¢ Powerful arm actions should be used to facilitate

leg drive.
¢ Ensure that the action of the arms is not counterproductive (i.e., does not cause a decrease in speed




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

or efficiency), particularly during transitioning
between difficult changes of direction (e.g., from
a backpedal to a sprint).

Training Goals
The three goals of agility performance are enhanced
perceptual—cognitive ability in various situations and
tactical scenarios, effective and rapid braking of one’s
momentum, and rapid reacceleration toward the new
direction of travel. To meet these goals, one should
emphasize the following:
* Directing visual focus toward the opponent’s
shoulders, trunk, and hips to increase perceptual
ability to anticipate the movement of a defensive
or offensive opponent (75)

* Orienting the body into a position that allows for
effective application of forces into the ground to
maximize braking capacity, and increasing the
speed from which one can rapidly stop as well as
the direction of movement one must brake from
(running forward, running backward, or shuffling
laterally) (15, 70, 78, 83, 84, 86)

¢ The ability to maintain a good position after braking, reorient the body into a position that faces the
new direction, and effectively use acceleration
mechanics to reaccelerate (58)

Methods of Developing Speed
From a practical standpoint, the demonstration of proper
speed is the result of well-organized programming that
organically develops and matures the required skill
sets within the athlete. This organic approach to sprint
training results from a schema of development that
is based on the emphasis and de-emphasis of certain
qualities, such as acceleration and maximum velocity,
within each training phase. Furthermore, the training
plan should coordinate these singular qualities through
phasic progression. A well-constructed training plan
highlights specific components that will assist in fully
maximizing an athlete’s movement potential.

Sprinting
Although a variety of training stimuli are important
for the optimization of athletic performance, it can be
argued that no exercise improves running velocity more
than maximum-velocity sprinting. An athlete’s sprint
prowess depends on the generation of high forces in
short periods oftime (52, 93). Neurological adaptations
resulting from long-term training plans that emphasize
maximal strength and movement velocity improve both
RFD and impulse generation (1, 89). In the strength and

conditioning setting, weightlifting movements and jump
training are prescribed to develop RFD and impulse at
varying loads, as these movements use the SSC. Similarly, upright sprinting uses the SSC, defining it as a
plyometric movement. Chronic exposure to movements
eliciting the SSC can increase muscle stiffness, which is a
potential physiological advantage for sprint ability (29).
In addition, sprinting requires near-maximum to maximum muscle activation, which depends on high central
nervous system activity. This activity is often referred
to as rate coding (47, 68). When signal frequency
reaches a threshold, skeletal muscle may not completely
relax between stimulations (47). Incomplete relaxation
results in more forceful contractions and a greater RFD
in subsequent contractions (57). Therefore, chronic
exposure to sprinting may lead to improvements in
musculoskeletal control via the central nervous system.
This would result in a cyclical dose-response relationship, as neurophysiological adaptations from previous
practices would bolster subsequent training. In an effort
to either enhance the force required or target potential
neuromuscular adaptations for sprinting improvement,
resisted and assisted sprint training techniques are often
employed. The proposed benefits, potential drawbacks,
and coaching considerations are outlined in table 19.3.

Strength
As noted throughout the chapter, sprint speed is underpinned by an athlete’s ability to produce large forces
within a brief period of time. These forces must be large
enough to (a) support the body weight in the presence of
gravity and (b) displace the body through an increase in
velocity (52). Thus many strength and conditioning professionals are aware of the importance of weight training
in the development of a sprint-based athlete. Central to
the discussion of strength training is how best to transfer
newly developed strength qualities from the weight room
to the track (96). The transfer of strength improvements
to sprinting may require an emphasis on the specificity
of training. This transfer of training effect deals with the
degree of performance adaptation and may result from
the similarities between the movement patterns, peak
force, RFD, acceleration, and velocity patterns of an
exercise and the sporting environment (87).
While maximal strength training may be beneficial,
training should emphasize agendas that merge maximal
strength and speed—strength qualities (34). The selection
of exercises and movements that provide opportunities
to display forces and velocities similar to those found
in sprinting may have the most benefit with regard to
enhancing rate coding and firing frequency, alongside
alterations to Type II muscle fibers such as cross-sectional area and fascicle length (30, 33). For instance,
evidence suggests that weightlifting movements and

with the intention of

speeds

Theoretically, these
training tools are used
in hopes of exposing
the athlete to higher
velocities than one can
achieve in unassisted
sprinting by inducing an
increased stride rate.
This increased stride
rate is hypothesized
to have potential for
neuromuscular adaptations to increase maximal sprint velocity.

Assisted sprinting may prematurely rush an athlete's stance
phase, thus removing time
needed to exert proper forces,
and has been shown to result
in decreased muscle activation
and propulsive force production
in comparison to maximal running (55). Therefore what can be
described as “chop” steps may
often be observed.
Exercises that rely on the towing
of athletes may increase braking
forces in comparison to maximal
running (55) as athletes attempt
to tolerate velocities they cannot
naturally create or accommodate
to as a result of biomechanical
efficiency, training state, or both.
Downhill sprinting may expose
the athlete to unnecessary
eccentric forces through a modified stance leg that results from
having to “find the ground.” This
may also affect the SSC, which is
optimized through the foot placement occurring just in front of
the center of mass upon ground
contact in flat-surface upright
sprinting (55).
To date, very little research supports the implementation of over
speed training, as sprint Success
results from an athlete's ability
to produce large forces in a short
ground contact time.

Top-speed sprinting should
be developed through
more natural and safer
training tools that consider

biomechanics.

overloading the acceleration phase, resulting
in ground contact times
that produce higher

Improving acceleration,
which is a change In
velocity, may lead to an
increase in top speed
through enhanced rate
of force development.

Sprint efforts against a load that
is too great may lead to longer
ground contact times in addition
to shorter stride lengths that are
not task specific (49).
Slopes of incline that are too
great may modify proper sprinting biomechanics, resulting in
rehearsal of improper technique
and thus limiting transfer of training effect.
Sled pushing may alter the natural
sprinting gait cycle due to the
removal of arm action that synchronizes and counterbalances
the leg action occurring at the
hip.

Coaches and athletes
attempting to improve
the acceleration phase of
a sprint may adopt resistance training modalities
that maintain normal
biomechanics involved in
unresisted sprints.
Loads should be chosen
based on the sporting
context while also considering the athlete's physical
status. For instance, track

Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

their derivatives such as the clean, snatch, and midthigh

pulls may enhance sprint performance through physiological adaptations such as muscular stiffness, enhanced
RED, and coactivation of the musculature surrounding
the hips and knees (6, 18, 24).

Mobility
While not a kinetic variable, soft tissue manipulation has
become an increasingly used practice in the development
of speed athletes. Coaches and trainers rely on tools such
as stretching, chiropractic care, massage, and myofascial
release in an attempt to achieve optimal mobility within
the dynamic state. Mobility is the freedom of an athlete’s
limb to move through a desired range of motion, whereas
flexibility is a joint’s total range of motion. With an
understanding that positional characteristics are among
several limiting factors in performance, coaches should
ensure that proper postural integrity is in place before
the onset of practice or competition.
Based on the previously described constructs of
speed, the currently accepted model of sprint success
is based on the athlete’s ability to produce and overcome ground reaction forces in a short amount of time.
Moreover, while these ground reaction forces assist in
producing optimal stride length through forward propulsion, the sprinter’s position in flight may be limited by
insufficient mobility. Specifically, an athlete may possess
the physical characteristics necessary to yield high rates
of force in a short amount of time, but compromises in
a joint’s freedom of movement will result in misplaced
forces. The improper placement of forces due to erroneous ground contact will result in dampened sprint speed
and an increased likelihood for injury.

Methods of Developing Agility
As discussed throughout the chapter, a multifactorial
approach is warranted to develop both the physical and
the perceptual—cognitive aspects required for continual
improvement in agility performance. Therefore, one
should consider a plan that addresses underpinning physical capacities using various strength development strategies, technical competence in a closed skill environment
with movement-specific actions (change-of-direction
ability), and improvement of perceptual—cognitive
capacity through agility drills and inherent aspects of
skills practice (58).

Strength
Similar to aspects of strength development for speed,
strength development for agility should emphasize relative strength and a variety of speed—strength qualities
along the force—velocity spectrum. However, additional

development of the eccentric strength of the athlete due
to the large braking forces during change-of-direction
and agility movements should be considered. This
means that training exercises can include a spectrum of
load—velocity profiles in the weight room (32) as well
as a variety of load—velocity profile activities in the
field, such as squat jumps, countermovement jumps, and
drop jumps of various heights in combination with the
change-of-direction and agility drills themselves. The
multifactorial nature of agility warrants a well-rounded
approach to strength development. Table 19.4 provides
an example of how training in the weight room and on
the field can satisfy the strength requirements underlying
agility performance. Understanding that athletes will
develop the physical requirements before being able to
transfer newly gained strength into technical competence
helps both coaches and athletes realize that performance
gains will lag behind fundamental physical requirements
for a given technical skill (88).

Change-of-Direction Ability
Similar to the progressions of plyometric activities based
on intensity and difficulty of each drill, closed skill
change-of-direction drills can progress from beginner
to intermediate to advanced levels based on the physical
loading demands that have been discussed in this chapter.
Table 19.5 presents an example of a progression of drills
for change-of-direction ability (both rapid changes of
direction and those associated with maneuverability), as
well as a progression plan for agility drills. The physical
loading during agility drills will be higher than beginner
change-of-direction drills. Therefore, table 19.5 provides
practitioners with a series of drills and a guideline for
safely and effectively advancing athletes so they can
build on their physical and technical attributes as they
improve.

Perceptual—Cognitive Ability
During years of skills training (within the sport), athletes
continually enhance visual scanning, pattern recognition,
and knowledge of the situation, while in drills used to
improve agility (outside of skills practice) they primarily
focus on improving anticipation, decision-making time,
and accuracy. In the same way one would regularly
increase the demands of a physical task to continually
improve performance, one can train perceptual—cognitive ability (table 19.5). Therefore, agility activities
should begin by adding a perceptual—cognitive component to common closed skill change-of-direction drills.
For example, decelerations or the Z-drill can evolve into
agility drills by including a generic stimulus such as a
whistle, a coach command, or a flashing arrow or light

(76, 97). Following success with the aforementioned

agility drills, progression requires activities that have
sport-specific stimuli such as evasive drills and smallsided games, which have been said to have better transfer
to performance (76, 97). Both generic and specific stimuli can be made more difficult within a given agility drill
through progressive increases in either temporal (time)
or spatial (space or area) stress on the athlete.

Program Design
Program design involves planning at several levels,
each with its own set of considerations: microcycles
(short-term), mesocycles (medium-term), and macrocycles (long-term). The process is referred to as peri-

odization. Periodization is the strategic manipulation
of an athlete’s preparedness through the employment
of sequenced training phases defined by cycles and
stages of workload. These planned workloads are
varied in order to facilitate the integration of planned
programming tactics that will harmonize the relationship
between training-induced fatigue and accommodation
(22). Furthermore, the periodization process is guided
by information collected during the athlete monitoring
process. Specifically, as an athlete progresses through a
training phase, consistent information acquired through
various monitoring strategies helps to show how the
athlete is responding to the training stimulus in the short
term and how the athlete should be further developed in

the long term—that is, how the original training program
should be modified to reflect responses to the training.
At each level of training plan development, strength
and conditioning professionals must manipulate certain variables. While these are useful in characterizing
the training agenda as well as quantifying workloads,
coaches should also keep in mind that each variable must
be considered individually as well as with regard to how
it affects the collective system. Moreover, individual athlete training responses, which athlete monitoring reveals,
should be used in the manipulation ofthese variables.

* Exercise order—the sequence in which a set of
repetitions is executed

* Frequency—the number oftraining sessions performed in a given time period (e.g., day or week)

* Intensity—the effort with which a repetition is

* Series—a group of sets and recovery intervals

of 1,500 kg

Chapter 21 explains periodization of resistance training
programs, and the same concepts can be applied to sprint,
change-of-direction, and agility training.


Program Design and Technique for Speed and Agility Training

Speed Development Strategies
The planning process for speed development is very
similar to that used by strength and conditioning professionals in the weight room. Specifically, planning
tactics should be periodized in a manner that addresses
the physical and psychological components of sprinting
through emphasis and de-emphasis on particular qualities in a phasic manner. An athlete’s capability to sprint
can be improved through the incorporation of training
periods that are designed to fully maximize and saturate
a fitness quality, which may bolster the effects of future
training agendas.
In order to enhance speed, a practitioner should consider the relationship between human locomotion and
force production. Throughout this chapter the authors
have pointed to a link between sprint success and certain
physiological phenomena. Elite sprinters produce large
amounts of force within a short amount of time. This
high level of force allows the sprinter to produce longer
stride lengths at a faster rate. This display of movement

on the track is a reflection of enhanced neuromuscular
factors, namely maximal strength, RFD, and impulse.
These variables are the product of well-designed training
protocols that aim to enhance qualities such as the hypertrophy of task-specific motor units, firing frequency, rate
coding, and muscle—tendon stiffness.
The example of speed development provided in the
application table demonstrates how sequenced phases
of training may seamlessly develop sprint potential
through the maturation of accelerative abilities before
the execution of maxima!-velocity efforts. This model,
which can be referred to as a short to long method of
sprint training, is a conceptual progression that attempts
to merge the relationship between larger rates of acceleration and greater sprint velocities (discussed earlier in
this chapter) (23). Specifically, an athlete taking part ina
short to long model will begin the training year with an
emphasis on improving propulsive force output through
short sprints that maintain the biomechanics associated
with the acceleration phase of a sprint. Later, the athlete
bridges into longer sprint work that aims to enhance top

*An acceleration hold is a sprint drill for which the coach places a cone on the track near or slightly before the point at which an athlete's

shin typically rises to a vertical position, which is indicative of upright sprinting. The athlete is then instructed to maintain the speed

achieved up to the cone through the remainder of the sprint. For instance, an athlete may be prescribed acceleration holds for 40 m, but

the coach's mark ending the acceleration zone is placed at the 20 m mark on the track. The athlete then maintains that speed from the 20
m to the 40 m. This drill is used to begin to focus on improving transitional mechanics as well as a method to introduce speed endurance.



Program Design and Technique for Speed and Agility Training

speed through upright running mechanics. The concept
behind this proposed model is that an athlete may see
greater improvements in top speed if force production
can occur at the ideal rate and moment through an investment in acceleration development and optimization
(52);

Monitoring Sprint Ability
The longstanding method of assessing an athlete’s speed
ability has typically involved a test of maximal-effort
linear sprinting. Much of the time, the maximal-effort
sprint test is carried out over a distance, such as 40 yards
(36.6 m), that is believed to be relevant to the athlete’s
sport. While time to completion is an effective tool to
evaluate changes in sprint performance, these tests do not

TABLE 19.6
Measure

fully address the minute changes regarding an athlete’s
progression toward race or field readiness. In addition,
testing error in the form of hand timing and various start
tactics confound the interpretation of testing results. As
a result, strength and conditioning professionals may
consider the adoption of additional monitoring tools as
part of their battery of assessments.
One such method of evaluation comes from the
assistance of high-speed cameras or optical timing systems that use interruptions of infrared light to capture
data from an athlete’s collective foot strike (12). This
technology provides coaches with additional insight into
the sprint capabilities of the athlete. Table 19.6 provides
a description of key variables that may be beneficial in
the monitoring of speed development.

Monitoring Speed Development

Description

Interpretation

Ground
contact time

The total time allotted for a single
stance phase.

In general, decreased ground contact times coupled with
improved sprint completion times may suggest that an athlete
has improved the ability to generate high rates of force in a
shorter amount of time.
However, an athlete may demonstrate slightly longer ground
contact times at the initial stages of the sprint due to acceleration mechanics.

Step length

The distance between the toe and
heel of two consecutive footsteps.
Example: centimeters between the
toe of right foot and the heel of left
foot.

Improvements in step length (increases in distance covered)
may occur through improved sprint mechanics or posture and
ultimately enhanced force output.

Stride length

The distance between the heel in two
consecutive steps of the same foot.
Example: meters between the heel of
the right foot and the heel of the next
ground contact made by the right foot.

Improvements in stride length (increases in distance covered
by two successive steps) may occur through improved sprint
mechanics or posture, and ultimately enhanced force output.

Flight time

The duration of time that an athlete Is
not in contact with the ground.
This occurs between the end of one
step and the beginning of the subsequent step.

Increases in flight time can be interpreted two ways: (1)
An athlete is producing higher vertical forces over a shorter
amount of time, resulting in proper horizontal displacement of
the athlete’s mass down the track. (2) An athlete is producing
higher forces over a longer amount of time, which may result
in unnecessary vertical amplitude of the center of mass.

Stride angle

The angle at which the foot leaves the
track.

The angle of stride may provide the coach with an ability
to determine if the athlete is producing forces at the right
moment, which is achieved through proper sprint mechanics.
Furthermore, data on the stride angle elucidate what stage of
sprint the athlete is attaining (acceleratory, transitory, maximum speed) and may relate to ground contact times.

Speed

The relationship between steps and
the sum of the first step’s ground contact time and the flight time leading to
the subsequent ground contact.

Speed dictates how fast an athlete can move the body mass
over a specific distance.

Acceleration

The change in speed as determined by
the delta of two steps (e.g., right heel
to left heel) and the sum of ground
contact times and flight times of each
step.

Acceleration provides insight into how well the athlete
changes speed (increasing velocity in a direction) over a prescribed distance. For most athletes, furthering the length an
athlete can accelerate will lead to higher top speed, provided
that postural integrity and mechanics are sound.

With the information provided by the testing as well as taking into account other physical fitness capacities, one
can implement an appropriate periodized plan. The application table for agility shows an example of three blocks
of training (four weeks each). The length of time for a training session is between 10 and 15 minutes inclusive of
work and rest time and can be completed one to three times per week dependent on additional requirements
of the athletes (such as skills training increasing in the preseason). A variety of drills can replace the examples
given here; however, they should be chosen based on their classification (table 19.2) and ability to address the
athlete needs.


Program Design and Technique for Speed and Agility Training

Agility Development Strategies
The development of agility is best achieved using a
periodized programming method. Random programming
or the development of agility using only “‘sport-specific
methods” such as small-sided games has not been found
to be as effective (11). Although agility is a constant

element on the field of play or during skills practices,
it is recommended that agility development begin with
the use of change-of-direction drills (preplanned) and
progress in difficulty through increases in the physical demands; this is followed by the addition of drills
involving perceptual—cognitive stress or what are typically termed “agility” drills (50, 97). In line with this

recommendation, the development ofagility should start
with a needs analysis based on assessment of the athlete’s change-of-direction ability and agility. The agility
test should specifically evaluate perceptual—cognitive
ability, as previously described in table 19.2. Further,
dependent on the additional movement requirements
of the sport, one may also choose to use a test that is
more dependent on maneuverability. The following is
an example of using this type of testing information to
create an informed agility program.

Monitoring Agility and
Change-of-Direction Ability

modification in either change of direction or agility
according to time to completion of the chosen test does
not isolate the physical quality or perceptual—cognitive
quality that one is trying to examine—the actual ability
to change direction (59, 61, 81, 85). Therefore, when
monitoring change-of-direction or agility performance,
the strength and conditioning professional may consider
the measures in table 19.7. Although these aspects of performance have been measured using expensive devices
such as three-dimensional motion analysis equipment,
readily available high-speed cameras (collecting more
than 100 frames per second) could easily be used in
conjunction with the usual timing methods (hand or
electronic) and in the absence of high-end biomechanical
equipment.

Monitoring Agility Development

Description

Interpretation

The difference in time between
a Straight-line sprint and a
change-of-direction test of equal
length.

Assessing the COD deficit provides insight into the additional amount of time required by the athlete due to the
demands of change of direction. An example is subtraction
of 10 m sprint time from 505 change-of-direction time (a
common COD test 10 m in length).

Ground contact
time

The total time the foot is in contact
with the ground during the change
of direction (length of the plant
phase).

Assessing the ground contact time in conjunction with
other variables can determine if the athlete is effectively
improving the actual change of direction independent of
the total time required to complete a COD test, which usually requires a greater percentage of straight-line sprinting.

Exit velocity

The horizontal velocity of the athlete
during the initial step out of the
plant of the change in direction.
Considered the first step of reacceleration from toe-off of the plant foot
to foot strike of subsequent step.

Unlike the situation for total time, using a high-speed video
camera to assess the velocity of the athlete (at the hip or
center of mass) can give a direct measure of the ability
to change direction. Improved exit velocity in conjunction with either the same or faster ground contact times
implies greater rate of force development relevant to
improving change-of-direction ability.

Entry velocity

Velocity of the athlete before the
plant phase; can be measured over
several steps or as the last step
is entering the plant phase of the
change of direction.

Similar methods can be used by practitioners to assess
entry velocity as suggested for exit velocity. This allows
the coach to understand the demand of the change of
direction that should be considered when tracking the exit
velocity.

Decisionmaking time

Measurement of the time between
two events is considered decisionmaking time and can either be a
positive or a negative value.

Similar to the measurement of entry and exit velocity, a
high-speed camera can be positioned to the side of the
directional change to capture both the stimulus and the
athlete's first definitive foot plant to change direction in
response. If the decision-making time is negative, this indicates that the athlete anticipated the directional change
before the stimulus finalized the movement. Negative
decision-making time is observed only during response to

Change-ofdirection deficit

Decision-making time can be broken
down into two different orientations
to comprehensively assess how athletes respond during game scenar
ios: (1) defensive (move in the same
direction as the stimulus); (2) offensive (move in the opposite direction

movements of another person (video or human stimulus),
highlighting the importance of stimulus specificity during
agility protocols. The
measurement of decision-making time in both defensive
and offensive situations allows coaches to identify whether
athletes need to develop perceptual-cognitive ability in a
specific game scenario.


Program Design and Technique for Speed and Agility Training

Conclusion
Speed, change of direction, and agility are well-established measures of athletic prowess in most sporting
contexts. For this reason, strength and conditioning
professionals should be aware of how these abilities are
established and modified through training plan design
and execution. These components of athletic movement
and game play are underpinned by task-specific force
application. This task-specific force production must
be large enough to stabilize the athlete’s body weight
in the presence of gravity, displace the athlete from one
point to another, and continue moving the athlete at
high velocities.
Running speed is associated with the relationship
between stride length and rate. Sprinting is anear-maximum
to maximum run that is defined by large rates of force
developed within a short stance time. Better sprinters
spend more time in the air as a result of increased stride
lengths that occur at faster rates than those of their
slower counterparts. Agility encompasses the skills and

abilities needed to explosively change movement velocities or modes in response to a stimulus. Both sprinting
and agility use the SSC and greater neuromuscular
efficiency compared to slower movements. However,
agility includes perceptual—cognitive demands such as
visual search scanning, decision making, anticipation,
and reaction times that make it a separate training quality.
Strength and conditioning coaches aiming to improve
these performance attributes should do so through the
cyclic and sequential arrangement of training phases
that harmonize strength training with speed, agility, or
change-of-direction practice or some combination of
these. This training effect may best result from the incorporation of exercises that are task specific and promote
proper movement mechanics. The training prescribed
should reflect the results of a needs analysis assessment
at the beginning ofa long phase or year. Furthermore,
subsequent training plans should be optimized through
an ongoing athlete monitoring program, which can assist
the strength and conditioning professional in determining
how the athlete is responding to the programmed agenda.

Speed Drills

The A-skip is a commonly prescribed sprint drill that
is used to simulate upright sprinting mechanics and
vertical force production.

Complete the aggressive drive down of the
swing leg through the forefoot until near triple
extension of the new stance leg occurs.

Starting Position

The fore- to midfoot of the new stance leg should
land under the hips, maintaining the stacked
joints appearance.

e Begin the exercise in a tall stance with torso
directly above the hips, knees, and ankles
(stacked joints).

At the initiation of contact, the opposing leg
should pop up rapidly to create a swing leg.
The force generated from the active push down
should coincide with a skipping motion that will
result in a horizontal displacement of the body
down the track.

Movement Phase
e Initiate movement by lifting one leg to a bent
knee position in which the top of the thigh is
near parallel. The foot of the lifted leg (swing
leg) should be approximately at knee height of
the stance leg, with the heel pulled up under
the buttocks. This will result in the appearance
of a “figure 4” at the legs. Swing leg will always
accord with this description

Technique Tips

e Begin the first skip by aggressively driving the
swing leg down to the ground through an active
foot, established through slight dorsiflexion.
“Lift the big toe up” to establish appropriate
dorsiflexion.

e Maintain a tall posture with relaxed shoulders
through the entire duration.
e The arms should move at the same

rate as the

legs, with minimal to no pausing of arm action
between cycles.

FAST FEET

This drill is designed to enhance the stride frequency
of a sprinter.

Starting Position
e Athlete begins exercise in a tall stance with
torso directly above the hips, knees, and ankles
(stacked joints).

Movement Phase
e Athlete initiates movement by lifting one leg to a
bent knee position, with the foot of the lifted leg
approximately at the halfway point of the shank
in order to replicate a swing leg. Swing leg will
always accord with this description.
e Once this position has been achieved, the athlete
alternates stance and swing legs as quickly as
possible while maintaining stacked joints.

e The quick and aggressive drive down of the
swing leg should be completed through the

forefoot, ensuring that the feet do not rise above
the halfway point of the shank. The aim of the
shortened rise of the swing leg is to ensure
quicker stepping frequency.

The fore- to midfoot of the new stance leg should
land under the athlete’s hips, maintaining the
stacked joints appearance.
The athlete's arm should move at the same rate
as the legs, with minimal to no pausing of arm
action between cycles.

Technique Tips
While this drill has traditionally been prescribed
to increase a sprinter’s stride frequency, remember that stride frequency is a by-product of high
vertical forces occurring in a short ground contact
time. In other words, an athlete cannot artificially
improve stride frequency by moving the feet
faster during a sprint event.

SPRINT RESISTANCE: INCLINE FOR ACCELERATION

Incline sprinting is a type of resisted sprinting that
is prescribed to promote improvements within the
acceleration phase of a sprint.

Starting Position
¢ Begin the exercise by placing the athlete in the
correct starting position (commonly called a
crouched start). First, instruct the sprinter to split
the stance position by placing the dominant leg
forward and to drop the back/swing leg by one
to two foot lengths.
The length of split between the drive and swing
leg Is largely determined by the compromise
between the athlete's (a) ability to generate sufficient forces needed to overcome a lower center
of gravity and (b) comfort. In addition, the feet
should be split in such a manner that the front
and back legs are in line with the pelvis, so that
no unnecessary twisting of the hips occurs.
Once the split stance has been established,
instruct the athlete to drop the back knee
“straight down" so that the shank (shin) is
nearer (more parallel) to the ground. This aids in
promoting the proper driving position needed to
begin acceleration.
With a tall and rigid torso, the athlete should then
raise the arm that is opposite to the front/drive
leg to a position near or slightly above the forehead. The hand should be spaced approximately
6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away from the forehead. The rear arm (opposite to the rear/swing
leg) should be pulled back to a point at which the
hand is near the lateral aspect of the buttocks
with an elbow angle that may range from 100°

to 120°. This position allows for the arm action
to assist in producing sufficient propulsive forces
to overcome static inertia.

e Upon completion of setup, instruct the athlete
:
to lean the entire body forward so that 60% of
the body weight Is on the front leg. Ensure that
the athlete does not “break at the waist” during
this shift. The athlete should continue to feel
balanced and stable.

Movement Phase
e After body weight has been transferred, the athlete can initiate the sprint through an aggressive
push down and through the ground via the front/
drive leg. The back leg should also assist in force
production but will leave the ground earlier due
to starting stance position. Arm action should be
synchronous with leg action.

Technique Tips
e Cue

the

athlete

to maximize

accelerative

mechanics through a low heel recovery of the
rear/swing leg. This should be staged through the
proper setup of the crouched starting position
described earlier.
Coach the athlete to continue aggressive pushing
against the ground alongside an arm swing that
may be cued to emphasize a hand that is pulled
down and back. Recall that arm action often
parallels movements of the legs.
e The torso should remain tall and tight with the
head in a neutral position. The torso and head
are in line and will rise at the same rate as the
hips gradually rise.

DECELERATION DRILL

Deceleration drills are intended to improve the braking
ability of the athlete and assist in transfer of training
from eccentric strength exercises in the weight room
toward a more movement-specific pattern on the
field. The exercise should be performed first with
just forward running to deceleration and can then be
expanded to forward running into a lateral deceleration. In forward deceleration drills, the athlete rapidly
accelerates and then, in a fixed number of steps, controls the body into a stopped lunge position. In lateral
deceleration drills, the athlete rapidly accelerates and

then decelerates before a set position, braking while
facing perpendicular to the original running direction
and actively absorbing the force.

Movement Phase
e Depending on the physical and technical competence of the athlete, have him or her run forward
at half speed and then decelerate and stop within
three steps.
e |f the athlete effectively absorbs the load by the
third step, increase to running at three-quarters


speed (more than 10 yards [9 m] of acceleration)
and then decelerating within five steps.
e The most advanced version of this drill requires
braking from top speed and decelerating within
seven steps.
e The most demanding braking step or the step
resulting in the greatest deceleration occurs one
or more steps before stopping and does not
typically occur only on the final deceleration or
change-of-direction step.

Technique Tips
e Variations of this drill can be used during lateral
movement and backward running. An intermediate version of this drill would require the athlete
to accelerate for 5 to 15 yards (4.6 to 13.7 m)
(similar to what the 505 and modified 505 tests
call for) and come to a complete stop while facing
perpendicular to the original direction of running.
This allows for progression into reaccelerating
out of the deceleration.

Agility Drills

Z-DRILL

The Z-drill is intended as a beginning-level change-of-direction drill to develop proficiency in the patterns of
side shuffling, accelerating out of a change of direction, and decelerating into a change of direction.
See the diagram for cone arrangement and running
direction.

Starting Position

¢ Approaching this cone, the athlete shduld effectively decelerate and transition into another
shuffle (as with the second step).

Technique Tips

e Begin the exercise by starting at the first cone in
the athletic ready position with a lowered center
of mass and a stance wider than shoulderwidth.

Movement Phase
e Side shuffle to the next cone while keeping the
center of mass at a constant height (as low as
the original center of mass height during the start
position). Emphasize pushing the ground away.
Coaches may look at the angle of the shank to
ensure that it is directed toward the direction of
intended travel.

Z-DRILL SETUP


¢ The athlete should plant at or near the cone and
rapidly transition into a sprint toward the cone
located on the diagonal.

e This drill can be modified to run the Z formation
in reverse, which would require the athlete to
backpedal, adding another basic movement
pattern that is important in the beginning stages
of change-of-direction development. Throughout
the movement, one should evaluate the ability
to control the trunk effectively during changes
and transitions as well as effective and efficient
development of force during decelerations and
accelerations.

Movement Phase
e Run toward the stimulus and change direction
based on the direction in which the stimulus
points or the audible signal the stimulus provides (these two options are considered generic

stimuli).
e The director should point left or right when the
athlete reaches the 5-yard (4.6 m) (mark this with
another cone for the director to refer to).
e The athlete should plant and change direction as
soon as possible, accelerating to one of the two


cones that are placed at an angle of 45 degrees
and distance of 3 yards (2.7 m) to the left and
right of the stimulus.

Technique Tips
Variations of this drill to adapt for more specific stimuli

(advanced-level drill):

:

e Have the athlete move in the direction opposite
to the generic stimulus (offensive).
Have the stimulus take either a single step or
two steps, with the athlete responding either
offensively or defensively (instruct the athlete
as to which before each repetition). A two-step
addition option will increase the temporal difficulty of the drill, as one can cross over with an
initial left then right step to confuse the athlete
as to the final direction of the stimulus.
Have the stimulus pass an implement relevant to
the sport to either of two teammates standing
on the right and left of the stimulus.
