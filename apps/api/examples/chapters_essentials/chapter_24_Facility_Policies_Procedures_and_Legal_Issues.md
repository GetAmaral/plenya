Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

The strength and conditioning profession continues to
evolve. Typically, a practitioner’s knowledge and skill
development involves competencies in exercise science,
administration, management, teaching, and coaching

(20). With student-athlete safety and welfare at the
forefront, developing a policies and procedures manual
provides a blueprint for implementing safe and effective
programs and services.
Policies are essentially a facility’s rules and regulations; they reflect the goals and objectives of the
program. Procedures describe how policies are met or
carried out. It is necessary to examine program goals
and objectives, because they are the basis on which
policies and procedures are created. Additionally, specific policies and procedures should include elements
that protect the program and its employees from a risk
of litigation; issues such as guidelines for supervision
and instruction, facility administration, and emergency
action planning and response should be included. The
goal of this chapter is to identify areas of risk exposure
and means of increasing safety, as well as to guide the
strength and conditioning professional in providing and
enhancing the quality of services and programs.

Mission Statement
and Program Goals
A mission statement is an organization’s statement
of purpose (2). Creating a mission statement requires
forward thinking with the end result in mind. A good
mission statement provides the strength and conditioning
program with focus and direction and is the foundation
of effective administration. According to the Drucker
Foundation (22), the following are suggested criteria
for an effective mission statement:

¢ It should be short and sharply focused.
* It should be clear and easy to understand.

* It defines why the organization exists.
* It does not prescribe means.
¢ It is broad in scope.

* It provides direction for upholding code ofethics.
¢ It addresses and matches the organization’s scope
of practice.
* It inspires commitment.
The mission statement addresses three important components: target clientele (key market), what service
is being provided (contribution), and what makes the
service unique (distinction) (2).
The following is an example of a mission statement
ofa strength and conditioning program:

To provide to athletes the means by which they
can train consistently, sensibly, and systematically
over designated periods of time ina safe, clean, and
professional environment to help prevent injury
and improve athletic performance.
ra
Program goals are the desired end products of a
strength and conditioning program, stated in a broad,
general manner. An effective strength and conditioning
program should be based on scientific principles to
enhance performance and increase injury resistance with
intended outcomes specific to the sport and the athlete’s
position within the sport (7).
Developing a standard of care is a collaborative
responsibility. Therefore, developing a mission statement
and a list of program objectives should involve not only
the strength and conditioning department, but also the
institution, including but not limited to athletic administration and the sports medicine department. The more
people participating the better, so that all involved groups
and individuals take ownership and commit to achieving
the strength and conditioning program’s mission, goals,
and objectives.
A mission statement is an organization’s
statement of purpose, providing the strength
and conditioning program with focus and
direction.

Program Objectives
Program objectives are specific means of attaining program goals. If program goals are stated but the ways in
which these goals might be attained are not specified, the
result may be that athletes never achieve them. Program
objectives should encompass all areas of the program to
ensure that the goals are attained. Following is a sample
list of objectives that can lead to reaching program goals
and prepare a strength and conditioning professional to
handle the job requirements.
* Design and administer strength, flexibility, aerobic, plyometric, and other training programs that
reduce the likelihood of injuries and improve
athletic performance. More precisely, design
training programs that create the desired results
in body composition, hypertrophy, strength,
muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance,

speed, agility, coordination, balance, and power.
* Develop training programs to account for biomechanical and physiological differences between
individual athletes, taking into consideration their
ages, Sex, training status, physical limitations, and
injury status.


Facility Policies, Procedures, and Legal Issues

* Recognize acute and chronic physiological
responses and adaptations to training and their
implications for the design of sport-specific
training programs.
* Educate athletes on the importance of good
nutrition as well as sleep and its role in health
and performance.
* Educate athletes about the effects of performance-enhancing substances and their abuse,
relevant school policy, and legislation.

The performance team concept—that is, the use
of individuals with specific areas of expertise as
resources—can be applied in the creation of a strength
and conditioning program that works toward meeting
the preceding objectives. For example, when an athlete
requires rehabilitation and reconditioning, the sports
medicine staff should be consulted. The director of
strength and conditioning needs to establish written
policies and procedures for determining appropriate
utilization of staff in the delivery of safe, effective, and
efficient service. Additionally, an annual orientation
meeting should be held at the beginning of the school
year or sport season to familiarize staff, sport coaches,
and participants with the established goals, objectives,
policies, and procedures. Periodically reevaluate and
review goals and objectives.

Strength and Conditioning
Performance Team
The responsibilities of the strength and conditioning
professional are continually changing as the field grows

TABLE 24.1

and becomes better recognized (14). The strength and
conditioning staff can be aligned through the hiring of
practitioners with formal education and specialization in
specific scientific foundations (e.g., anatomy, exercise
physiology, biomechanics). An assembled team allows
for cooperative expertise by practitioners with complementary skills and provides an educational opportunity
for staff members to gain knowledge outside of their
specialization. Table 24.1 provides a practical example
of a strength and conditioning performance team. The
director of strength and conditioning is responsible for
delineating the appropriate duties and responsibilities to
the strength and conditioning staff for program design,
exercise technique, organization and administration, and
testing and evaluation.
Although job responsibilities vary according to
institution, it would be prudent to consult Strength and
Conditioning Professionals Standards and Guidelines
(20) when one is developing the strength and conditioning performance team. Guideline 2.3 of this document
states the following:
The productivity of a Strength and Conditioning
staff, as well as learning and skill development of

individual members, should be enhanced by aligning a performance team comprised of qualified
practitioners with interdependent expertise and
shared leadership roles. Once the team is assembled, respective activities and responsibilities
from the “Practical/Applied” domain identified
in the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist Examination Content Description, as well
as the appropriate liaison assignments, should be
delegated according to each member’s particular
“Scientific Foundations” expertise.

Facility Policies, Procedures, and Legal Issues

The director is also responsible for developing,
presenting, and enforcing the written policies and procedures of the staff and participants in the program. It is
the responsibility of the director to ensure that staff are
properly trained and prepared. He or she achieves this
by having staff and student-athlete orientation meetings
and by periodically evaluating the staff’s professional

performance as well as determining and evaluating the
attainment of professional goals. A sample form for the
evaluation of student staff members is provided in figure
24.3. This form could be used to evaluate student interns
and adapted to apply more specifically and effectively to
members of the strength and conditioning performance
team.

Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Strength and Conditioning Staff
(Personal Qualifications)
The possession of a certification from an independently
accredited organization, such as the Certified Strength
and Conditioning Specialist certification, establishes a
standard of care. On August 1, 2015, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I adopted
legislation “To specify that a strength and conditioning
coach shall be certified and maintain current certification
through a nationally accredited strength and conditioning
certification program” (p. 1) (16). Continuing education
is a necessary part of maintaining a professional certification and reducing liability exposure, especially in the
area of supervision and instruction (1). Litigation issues
in this area often involve questions of “professional
instructor qualifications,” which include continuing
education (19). Thus, assistant strength and conditioning professionals should also achieve and maintain a
professional certification including standard first aid,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and automated
external defibrillation (AED). (See figure 24.4 for points
of preparedness required of each staff member.)

Additionally, each staff member needs to understand
the strength and conditioning program’s goals and objectives, cooperatively work with others’ responsibilities
and schedules (such as the other members of the sports

medicine team), and maintain a professional code of
conduct.
Appendix A of Strength and Conditioning Professional Standards and Guidelines defines the strength
and conditioning professional:
Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists are
professionals who practically apply foundational
knowledge to assess, motivate, educate, and train

athletes for the primary goal of improving sports
performance. They conduct sport-specific testing
sessions, design and implement safe and effective strength training and conditioning programs,
and provide guidance for athletes in nutrition
and injury prevention. Recognizing their area of
expertise is separate and distinct from the medical,
dietetic, athletic training, and sport coaching fields,
Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists
consult with and refer athletes to these professionals when appropriate. (p. 13)

Facility Policies, Procedures, and Legal Issues

Legal and Ethical Issues
Everyone involved in athletic activities, including the
strength and conditioning professional, must be cognizant oflegal liability. The risk of
injury cannot be totally
eliminated, but it can be effectively managed by the
strength and conditioning professional. Risk management is the employment of strategies to decrease and
control the risk of injury from athletic participation and
therefore the risk of liability exposure. The first steps in
risk management are to understand integral key terms
and identify the areas of potential liability exposure that
could cause injuries and lead to litigation. Although each
facility is unique, recognizable areas of potential liability
are present in all strength and conditioning facilities. The
following sections discuss these risk areas and the need
for an emergency care plan, reliable record keeping, and
liability insurance.

Common Legal Terminology
To understand the potential legal ramifications of running a strength and conditioning facility, the strength
and conditioning professional must first understand the
following common legal terms.
Informed consent—The process by which a procedure or activity is described to a participant, with
an explanation of the inherent risks and benefits
involved, allowing the individual to determine if he
or she desires to participate.

Liability—A legal responsibility, duty, or obligation.
Strength and conditioning professionals have a duty
to the athletes they serve by virtue of their employment not only to act when an injury occurs but also
to prevent injury (5).
Standard of care—What a reasonable and prudent
person would do under similar circumstances. A
strength and conditioning professional is expected to
act according to his or her education, level of training,
and certification status (e.g., Certified Strength and

Conditioning Specialist [CSCS], National Strength
and Conditioning Association Certified Personal
Trainer [NSCA-CPT], Emergency Medical Technician [EMT], CPR, AED, first aid).
Negligence—Failure to act as a reasonable and prudent person would under similar circumstances.
Four elements must exist in order for a strength and
conditioning professional to be found negligent: duty,
breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages (20).
The strength and conditioning professional must be
found to have had a duty to act and to have failed to
act (a breach) with the appropriate standard of care,

resulting in damages (physical or economic injury) to
another person because of the natural and continuous

sequence of reasonably foreseeable events (proximate
cause). For example, a strength and conditioning
professional sees that a cable is excessively worn on
a resistance training machine and notes it, but does
not post an “Out of Order” sign. An athlete uses the
machine and incurs an injury. In this case, the strength
and conditioning professional could be found negligent: His or her duty was to fix the cable or post a sign,
but he or she failed to act, and an athlete sustained an

injury because of the potentially injurious situation
of a cable that was ready to break.
Assumption of risk—Knowing that an inherent risk
exists with participation in an activity and voluntarily
deciding to participate anyway (11). All athletic activities, including strength and conditioning, involve
a certain level of risk; athletes must be thoroughly
informed of the risk and should sign a statement to
that effect.

Preparticipation Screening
and Medical Clearance
Before an athlete is allowed access to the strength and
conditioning facility, preparticipation screening and
clearance in accordance with relevant governing bodies
(e.g., NCAA, institution sports medicine staff, and high
school athletic associations) are required. This requirement is established under Section | of Strength and
Conditioning Professional Standards and Guidelines
(20). Standard 1.1 “requires participants to undergo
health care provider screening and clearance before participation.” The strength and conditioning professional
does not need an actual copy of the physical examination
but should require a signed statement to show proof
of medical clearance to participate. Athletes who are
returning from an injury or illness or who have special
needs (e.g., have diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, hypertension) should also be required to show proof of medical
clearance before beginning or returning to a strength and
conditioning program.
Procedures should therefore be in place to ensure that
documentation confirming that each athlete was screened
and cleared to participate by the sports medicine staff is
on record in the main office of the strength and conditioning program before athletes are allowed to participate.
Note, however, that it is the responsibility of the sports

medicine staff (e.g., the team or program’s certified athletic trainer, physician, or physical therapist) to allow an
athlete to begin formal involvement in the strength and
conditioning program. In the case ofa school location,
this applies to both athletes who are new to the school
or program and athletes who are just recovering from an
injury or illness. This stipulation is important because
it is not in the strength and conditioning professional’s




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

scope of practice (i.e., proper legal parameters and professional duties) to diagnose or evaluate an individual’s
medical or health condition. Therefore, only the sports
medicine staff can provide medical clearance (and proof
thereof) and answer any questions about participation.

¢ All participants must sign a release agreement
form. Figure 24.5 shows a sample release of
liability forrn. Check any such form for compliance with current local and national laws before
using it.

Eligibility Criteria

¢ All participants must follow the rules and regulations of the strength and conditioning facility.

To focus the attention and efforts of the strength and
conditioning staff on a target training population, certain eligibility requirements should be established. The
following is a list of typical individuals or groups who
are allowed to use the strength and conditioning facility
at an institution:

¢ Full- or part-time student-athletes participating in
an athletic department-sponsored sport
* Newly incoming and just-transferred student-athletes who have registered for school and have
confirmation of team status as designated by the
head sport coach
¢ Students in physical education classes
¢ All athletic department coaching and administrative staff

¢ All sports medicine department staff
¢ Alumni athletes who participated in an athletic
department—sponsored sport and completed their
eligibility
¢ Individuals and groups approved by the athletic
director or director of strength and conditioning

Other individuals or groups may request access to
the strength and conditioning facility. These persons or
groups must receive prior approval by the athletic director or director of strength and conditioning and should
have a prearranged schedule that specifies when they will
use the facility so proper supervision can be provided.
To be consistent and objective, it is advantageous to
have a policy in place to refer to rather than having to
decide on this on a case-by-case basis. This policy is
especially important as it relates to the facility fee, if
any. The following are examples of common criteria by
which to determine whether outside organizations can
use a strength and conditioning facility:
¢ Use must be preapproved by the athletic director.
¢ Use must be preapproved by the strength and
conditioning director.

¢ The program or session must be supervised by
strength and conditioning department staff.
¢ The program or session must be scheduled during
off-hours when athletes are not present.
¢ The individual or organization must supply written proof of additional liability insurance.

* The athletic director and the strength and conditioning director have the right to limit an individual’s or group’s access, if warranted.

Record Keeping
Documentation is fundamental to the effective management of a strength and conditioning facility. Secure
records should be kept on file of cleaning and maintenance, safety procedures, manufacturer’s warranties and
guidelines, assumption-of-risk or other informed consent
forms, medical waivers and clearance forms, personnel
credentials, professional guidelines and recommendations (e.g., use of weight belts, resistance training techniques), and injury report forms (20). Injury report forms
should be maintained as long as possible in case an injury
suit is filed. The time during which individuals can file
a lawsuit (1.e., the statute of limitations) varies (from
state to state in the United States as well as throughout
the world), so it is a good practice to maintain files
indefinitely or to check with a legal authority (12).

Liability Insurance
Because of the potential for injury in athletic participation, it is essential for strength and conditioning staff
members to purchase professional liability insurance,
especially if they are not covered under the facility
policy. Liability insurance is a contractual promise by
which the insurer promises to defend and indemnify the
insured, up to the defined limits of liability, from certain
defined liability risks at the insurer’s cost in exchange
for payment of a premium. Strength and conditioning
professionals should consult their human resource manager, legal consultant, or professional organization (e.g.,
NSCA) for further information.
Insurance is a contractual promise by which
the insurer promises to defend and indemnify the insured, up to the defined limits of

Product Liability
Product liability refers to the legal responsibilities of
those who manufacture or sell products if a person sus-

tains injury or damage as a result of using the product (1).

FIGURE 24.5 All participants must sign a liability waiver, which should be modified as needed to comply with
local and national laws. Reducing liability for on-premise injuries during use of the facility is critical in any risk
management

strategy.

Adapted from Earle 1993 (7); Epley 1998 (8).

Although strength and conditioning professionals may
not manufacture or sell a product, they can be named as
codefendants in product liability suits. Therefore, it is
important for strength and conditioning professionals to
understand the concept of product liability and actions
that could place them at risk for litigation. Although
product liability applies only to those who are in the
business of manufacturing or selling products, there are
behaviors that can void liability of the manufacturer or
seller and place responsibility in the hands of the strength
and conditioning professional. Two key considerations
that determine whether the manufacturer or seller is
liable are whether the product has been changed from
the condition in which it was originally sold and whether
the product is used as intended by the manufacturer (5).
To avoid injury to athletes caused by strength and conditioning equipment, the following steps should be taken:

¢ Use equipment only for the purpose intended by
the manufacturer. Refer to the manufacturer’s
instructional materials that accompany the equipment, including user age and size specifications.

* Be certain that equipment meets existing professional standards and guidelines. Do not purchase
and use equipment that has been deemed unsafe
or ineffective by professional organizations and
experts. Be aware of equipment recalls, and return
such equipment to the manufacturer immediately.

Buy only from reputable manufacturers. Strength
and conditioning professionals must do their
homework to check on the safety record of a
manufacturer or seller and any claims that may
have been filed against that manufacturer or seller.
Organizations such as the Better Business Bureau
in the United States, other strength and conditioning colleagues, and professional organizations are
good resources for this information.

Do not modify equipment unless such adaptations
are clearly designated and instructions for doing
so are included in the product information. Some
equipment is designed to be modified for specific
needs, such as fitting, but directions for modifying
the product must be followed exactly.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

* Apply all warning labels that accompany a new
equipment purchase. If such labels are not placed
on the machine in plain view and an individual is
injured (and the injury relates to what the warning
label addresses), the strength and conditioning
professional can be held liable.
* Continually inspect equipment for damage and
wear that may place an athlete at risk for injury.
To recognize potential problems, the strength and
conditioning professional must understand the
purpose, capabilities, and limitations of equipment and how equipment can cause injury. Always
inspect newly purchased equipment before use.
If new equipment arrives damaged, immediately
notify the manufacturer or seller and have it
replaced. If currently owned equipment becomes
damaged, remove it for repair or replacement. If
equipment is too large to remove or no storage
space exists, affix a sign to the equipment stating
that it should not be used.
¢ Do not allow unsupervised athletes to use equipment. Constant supervision of the athletes by the
strength and conditioning professional ensures
that equipment is used for its intended purpose
and with proper technique (20).

Discipline

rule or guideline that was broken, and a reminder
of the disciplinary action that will result from a
second offense.
* Second offense: Dismissal from the facility for
one day, documentation of the offense by the staff
member, correspondence with the athlete’s sport
coach, and a reminder of the disciplinary action
that will result from a third offense.

¢ Third offense: Dismissal from the facility for one
week, documentation of the offense by the staff
member, correspondence with the athlete’s sport
coach, and a reminder of the disciplinary action
that will result from a fourth offense.
* Fourth offense: Dismissal from the facility for
the remainder of the year, documentation of the
offense by the staff member, correspondence with
the athlete’s sport coach and the athletic director,
and a reminder of the disciplinary action that will
result from a fifth offense.
¢ Fifth offense: Permanent dismissal from the
facility, documentation of the offense by the staff
member, and correspondence with the athlete’s
sport coach and the athletic director.

Supplements, Ergogenic Aids,
and Banned Substances

To ensure that athletes adhere to the facility rules, the
strength and conditioning director may want to require
them to sign and date a copy of the facility rules and
guidelines to acknowledge that they understand and will
adhere to all rules before facility use. This process will
reduce the possibility of claims that they did not know
the repercussions of aberrant behavior. The facility
rules need to be enforced, with possible disciplinary
actions posted, documented, and levied in proportion
to the offense. The use of exercise and conditioning
activities as punishment is discouraged. According to
The Inter-Association Task Force for Preventing Sudden
Death in Collegiate Conditioning Sessions best practice
recommendations, “‘no additional physical burden that
would increase the physical risk of injury or sudden death
should be placed on the athlete under any circumstance”
(p. 478). Following is an example of a tiered penalty
system applied to a repeated violation (7). (Note that
this type of policy must be established with full support
and involvement of the athletic director and all sport
coaches. Typically, the strength and conditioning staff
does not have to pursue disciplinary actions past the first
or second offense, because most sport coaches want to
handle such a situation.)

Strength and conditioning professionals are commonly
approached for nutrition and supplement advice. The
strength and conditioning professional is expected
to uphold the NSCA Code of Ethics. Standard 9.1 in
Strength and Conditioning Professional Standards and
Guidelines states:

* First offense: A verbal warning by a staff member,
an explanation of the nature and importance of the

and seek out the related rules and regulations, as well

Strength and Conditioning professionals must not
prescribe, recommend or provide drugs, controlled
substances or supplements that are illegal, prohibited or harmful to participants for any purpose
including enhancing athletic performance, conditioning or physique. Only those substances that are
lawful and have been scientifically proven to be
beneficial, or at least not harmful, may be recom-

mended or provided to participants by Strength and
Conditioning professionals, and only to individuals
age 18 or above.

Rules and regulations may differ between various
sport governing bodies (e.g., NCAA, United States
Olympic Committee, Major League Baseball, National
Basketball Association, National

Football

League,

National Hockey League). It is the responsibility of the
strength and conditioning professional to stay up to date
as the scientific evidence that supports or refutes the


Facility Policies, Procedures, and Legal Issues

efficacy of nutritional supplements. It is recommended
that strength and conditioning professionals consult with
a sports nutritionist or dietitian on matters regarding
nutritional supplements.

Staff Policies and Activities
Discussed here are various policies typically established
and activities typically observed in a strength and
conditioning facility. This information is provided for
reference only; each strength and conditioning facility is
unique and may have certain characteristics that dictate
the specific application of these policies and activities.

Orientation Meeting
Typically, at the beginning of the school year or sport
season, an orientation meeting is held for the athletes
and sport coaches before their first use of the strength
and conditioning facility. At this meeting the director
provides the phone numbers of the facility and staff and
explains the services of the staff (goals, objectives, and
mission of the program), hours of operation including
team training schedule, facility rules and regulations
including disciplinary actions, and emergency procedures. Preparticipation and eligibility requirements
should be explained. A strength training orientation
should cover proper equipment use including spotting
techniques when appropriate, correct exercise execution,
and common risks associated with incorrect or inattentive exercise technique or spotting.

Reporting and Documentation
As discussed earlier, proper documentation and record
keeping are essential to the management and monitoring of the strength and conditioning programs and
facilities. In cases of emergency or incidents of injury,
it is important to establish a chain of command for risk
management. This may include coaches, the director of
strength and conditioning, sports medicine personnel,
and the athletics director. Significant efforts should be
made to protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants. In compliance with federal regulatory laws such as
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA), a participant’s health care information may not
be released without written authorization; this includes
injury reports provided by the sports medicine staff. An
incident—injury report form should be completed and
kept on file when an injury has occurred (19).
Additional records that should be developed and
maintained and that are crucial to the operation of the
strength and conditioning programs and facilities include
the following (20):

* Personnel credentials
* Professional standards and guidelines

¢ Policies and procedures for operation and safety
(written emergency plan)
¢ Equipment user manuals provided by the manufacturer (warranties, operating guidelines, installation, setup)
¢ Equipment and facility maintenance (inspection,
maintenance, cleaning, and repair)

¢ Preparticipation medical clearance
* Return-to-participation clearance
¢ Protective legal documents such as informed
consent, waiver of claim, personal contract

* Training logs, evaluation entries, instruction notes
Participants should complete and sign such legal documents at the annual orientation meeting.

Code of Ethics and Professionalism
A code of ethics comprises the standards and principles
for which the professional will be held accountable.
Most professional organizations have codes of ethics
or codes of conduct that members must agree to adhere
to and apply in their professional practices (17). These
codes are intended to establish professionalism and high
standards of ethical behavior while protecting the rights
and dignity of individuals. Strength and conditioning
professionals should become familiar with the NSCA
Code of Ethics as well as their institution’s code of ethics
and student-athlete code of conduct if applicable. Athlete
welfare is generally the primary focus. Bullying, hazing,
and social media guidelines may also be addressed.
Additionally, consider designating specific policies
for appearance or dress code, telephone use, personal
workouts, and personal use of company equipment, as
well as standards for the coach—athlete, coach—intern,

and coach-—sport coach relationships and athlete conduct
in the weight room (4, 18). These written principles
are intended to enhance the strength and conditioning
program’s effectiveness while promoting high standards
of integrity.

Instruction and Supervision
A qualified strength and conditioning professional must
properly instruct athletes in safe and effective strength
and conditioning techniques. Instruction involves teaching an athlete a skill in a safe manner and correcting
the athlete if necessary. Emphasizing safety and proper
technique for resistance training rather than the amount
of weight lifted helps reduce the incidence of injury
and therefore liability exposure. Instructional methods,




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

procedures, and progressions that are consistent with
professional guidelines and standards should be used (5).
Furthermore, direct supervision is required to achieve
maximum performance, safety, and instruction. Staff
members should have the ability to clearly communicate
and view both the athlete and the zone being supervised
(if not the entire facility). Spotting, in conjunction with
the use of appropriate safety equipment, is critical (19).
Staff should effectively communicate with the athlete
to ensure safe, proper, and effective spotting when
athletes are performing exercises in which free weights
are sustained on the trunk or moved over the face and
head. Principles of supervision include the following (5):
¢ Always be there.

* Be active and hands on.
* Be prudent, careful, and prepared.

Regarding the influence of supervision on performance, strength gains are greater in subjects training
under lower supervision ratios (10). Employers and
practitioners must understand the importance of staffing
for safety and performance gains and, in instances in
which optimal ratios are not possible for various reasons,
continually work toward a goal of meeting appropriate
ratios as soon as is practical.
Strength and conditioning professionals are commonly approached to attend team practices and competitions as well as to travel with the sport teams. They
should be encouraged to attend as long as this does not
adversely affect the facility’s coach-to-athlete ratio.
The risk of injury cannot be totally eliminated but can be effectively managed by
the strength and conditioning professional.

* Be qualified.
* Be vigilant.

Program Design

¢ Inform participants of safety and emergency
procedures.

An effective strength and conditioning program should
be based on scientific principles to enhance performance
and increase injury resistance with intended outcomes
specific to the sport (6). Program intensities should be
within NSCA standards and guidelines. Please refer
to chapters 14 to 21 and the NSCA’s various position
papers as resources for strength and conditioning training
plan development. The director of strength and conditioning should oversee and monitor all performance
training programs, including reconditioning. A copy of
all programs designed by staff (1.e., the list of exercises
to be performed) should be reviewed and on file in the
director’s office before a team begins their program (18).

* Know participants’ health status.
* Monitor and enforce rules and regulations.
¢ Monitor and scrutinize the environment.

Guideline 3.1 in Strength and Conditioning Professional Standards and Guidelines states the following:
Strength and Conditioning activities should be
planned, and the requisite number of qualified staff
should be available such that recommended guidelines for minimum average floor space allowed per
participant (100 ft’), professional-to-participant
ratios (1:10 junior high school, 1:15 high school,
1:20 college), and number ofparticipants per barbell or training station are achieved during peak
usage times. (p. 10)
Supervision was cited in an estimated 80% of court
cases in which athletic injuries occurred (5). Inadequate
instruction or supervision is often a main cause. All
athletes should be constantly supervised, which requires
the physical presence of a qualified strength and conditioning professional for overseeing all activities (12, 13,
15). To provide proper supervision, supervisor stations
need to be located where a clear view of the facility
and athletes is possible (19). Suggested staff-to-athlete
ratios should be also be adhered to, but these can vary
depending on the type oftraining. For instance, ifagroup
of athletes is performing a machine circuit training workout, they do not need as much supervision as athletes
who are lifting with free weights. Also, athletes with a
low training age need more supervision than athletes
who are experienced in the weight room.

Workout Sheet (Workout Card)
The process of generating a workout sheet is different
for each strength and conditioning program. Strength
and conditioning activities should be prearranged, and
therefore athletes must have an approved workout sheet
when training. Additional workouts should be approved
by the overseeing strength and conditioning coach to
ensure proper intensity and volume-load monitoring.
Strength and conditioning staff members must be familiar with every exercise on each athlete’s workout sheet
and should not advise an athlete to perform exercises
that are not listed on the workout sheet unless this has
been suggested by the director or the sports medicine
staff, which should be committed to writing as soon
as possible after the session. For each exercise that is

included on the sport teams’ workout sheets, including
plyometric, agility, and speed development drills, the
director needs to inform the staff regarding how the
exercise technique should be taught to athletes and also
provide demonstrations and instruction. For additional


Facility Policies, Procedures, and Legal Issues

supervision, practitioners may consider requiring the
athletes’ last set of foundational exercises to be seen by
a staff member and checked off for proper execution.
Establishing consistent verbiage across performance
training programs is recommended.

Facility Administration
Strength and conditioning facility rules and guidelines
are important for providing participants with guidance
on conduct and behavior, keeping order, and keeping
the program on course toward the goal of providing
a safe, clean, and professional training environment.
Refer to figure 24.6 for a list of common facility rules
and guidelines. These should be posted in the training
area where they can be easily seen.
Understand that the strength and conditioning facility
is unique and that it may have certain characteristics that
dictate the specific application ofpolicies and activities.
Equipment available and size of the facility or team can
present the coach with a logistical challenge for scheduling and developing hours of operation. One should
consider what workout format will affect the greatest
number of athletes when making scheduling decisions.
Particularly for small colleges or high schools, the goal
is to organize the strength and conditioning program so
as to allow the practitioner to work with the maximum
number of athletes based on the equipment and time
available while under a proper supervision ratio. In any
case, the priority of a team’s training time is dependent
on the season they are in. In-season teams typically have
priority over off-season teams, because often the training
schedule revolves around the practice and game schedule. Off-season teams may have to compromise and train
early in the morning if the facility cannot accommodate
multiple teams at a time.
One potential solution is adopting a Monday-Wednesday-Friday format for off-season teams, which opens
the facility to be used by in-season teams on Tuesday
and Thursday. If Friday competitions interfere with this
organization, a second scenario is scheduling some of
the off-season teams on Monday-Tuesday-Thursday
and some on Tuesday-Thursday-Friday. This will allow
the facility to be used by in-season teams on Monday
and Wednesday. Consider scheduling off-season teams
during typical afternoon practice times. In-season teams
can be scheduled early or late to reduce overcrowding
in the facility (3).
For opening and closing procedures, policies are
typically based on the daily operations, inspection,
and cleaning of the strength and conditioning facility.
Additionally, consider designating specific operating
procedures for holidays or for the institution’s academic

calendar, stereo or music use, office hours, storage, and
staff locker room activities. Again, these written principles are intended to enhance facility efficiency while
promoting program effectiveness (19).

Emergency Planning
and Response
Providing a standard of care is a shared responsibility
including, but not limited to, medical personnel, sport
coaches, strength and conditioning professionals, administrators, and the institution. Life safety is always the
first priority when an emergency occurs. Keep in mind
that an emergency, including athletic injuries, can occur
anytime and anywhere during activity. Having a written
response plan for environmental situations as well as
life-threatening and non-—life-threatening situations provides a guideline for proper procedures to be followed
and practiced in case of an emergency. This emergency
action plan is a written document that details the proper
procedures for caring for injuries. All personnel in the
strength and conditioning facility must know the emergency action plan and the proper procedures for dealing
with emergencies.

Components of
an Emergency Action Plan
The following are the typical items included or described
in an emergency plan:
¢* EMS (emergency medical services) activation
procedures

¢ Names and telephone numbers of primary, secondary, and tertiary individuals to contact
¢ Specific address ofthe strength and conditioning
facility (to give directions to EMS)
¢ Locations of the telephones
¢ Locations of nearest exits

¢ Designated personnel qualified to care for injuries
(i.e., sports medicine staff)
¢ Ambulance access
¢ Location of emergency supplies and first aid kit
¢ Plan of action in case of fire, tornado, life-threatening injury, crime, terrorism, and so forth

In addition to posting the emergency care plan in a
clearly visible location, it is critical that all strength and
conditioning professionals maintain current first aid and
CPR certification and practice the emergency action plan
at least quarterly.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Facility Rules and Guidelines
Prior to participation, athletes must go through a preparticipation screening and clearance procedure (5).
* Prior to participation, all athletes must attend an orientation on common risks involved in resistance training,
the proper execution of various exercises, and the possible consequences if proper technique Is not used.

¢

e Athletes must have a workout sheet, follow it, and record workout contents.

¢

|fanathlete has an injury that inhibits a portion of the workout, the athlete must receive a modified program
from the athletic medicine department that describes which exercises should be avoided and which ones
may be substituted.

e Athletes are required to use locks on the ends of all barbells.
e

No one should squat outside the squat or power rack.

¢

Bumper plates are required on the platforms for all power exercises.

e Athletes must not wear weight belts when the belts could contact equipment upholstery.

e Athletes should move weights from the racks to the bar only. They should never set plates on the floor or
lean them against equipment or walls. Athletes should return dumbbells to the rack in the proper order.
Athletes should not drop or throw weights or dumbbells.
e Athletes should show respect for equipment and facilities at all times; spitting in or defacing the facility is
not tolerated and will result in immediate expulsion.
e The weight room requires concentration. Horseplay, loud or offensive language, or temper tantrums are
not permitted.

e The staff offices and telephones are off limits to athletes unless permission to use them is given.
e Athletes should wear proper training attire, particularly shirts and athletic shoes, at all times.
e Athletes should use spotters for exercises that place the bar on the back or front shoulders and exercises
that involve a bar or dumbbells moving over the face or above the head. Power exercises are not spotted.
e Athletes should immediately report any facility-related injury or facility or equipment irregularity to the
supervisor on duty.
e Tobacco, food, chewing gum, glass bottles, cans, alcohol, drugs, and banned substances are not allowed
in the strength and conditioning facility; plastic water bottles are acceptable.
e

Supervisors are not responsible for users’ personal belongings or lost or stolen items.

e Jewelry such as loose necklaces, bracelets, hanging earrings, and watches should not be worn.
e Athletes should keep feet off the walls.
e Athletes should minimize chalk and powder on the floor.

e All guests and visitors must report to the office for signing of the waiver form.
¢

Former athletes must have their programs preapproved by a staff supervisor and must sign a waiver form.

e Athletic department personnel can use these facilities for personal workouts if they do not interfere with
the needs of the athletes.

¢ Non-athletic department personnel are allowed to use the facilities with permission of the athletic director
after signing a waiver form. Recognized users may include athletes, students, guests, staff, faculty with
permission, former athletes, family members, and visiting teams.
¢

Equipment leaving the weight room shall be checked out by the supervisor and recorded at the supervisor’s desk.

e The on-duty supervisors have authority over all weight room conduct and use of equipment and may expel
an athlete from the facility for failure to follow instructions.

acquire and maintain a professional certification including standard first aid, CPR, and AED (6, 20).

Emergency Communication
Establish a direct line of communication and formulate
a backup plan. Immediate communication is crucial to
quick delivery of emergency care. Access to a telephone
(land line or cellular) is a viable option if medical personnel are not on site. Ensure that participants in the
strength and conditioning program and the overseeing
supervisors know the location of the closest workable
telephone, whether it is inside or outside (6, 20).

Emergency Equipment
Emergency equipment should be readily available in an
emergency situation. Maintaining professional certifications for standard first aid, CPR, and AED means that
personnel have been trained in advance on proper use.

First responders should periodically rehearse. Additionally, emergency information for participants should be
readily available for access by medical personnel (20).

emergency situations and provide names, titles, and
telephone numbers of important individuals to contact as
part of the emergency team. Each individual may have
a different role, but understanding the roles allows the
emergency team to function effectively.
Within the emergency team, four principal roles exist.
The first is to provide immediate care ofthe athletes, as
time is the most critical factor in emergency situations.
The second involves emergency equipment retrieval, as
users ofthe facility should be made aware ofthe types
and locations of emergency equipment before participation. Next is the activation of the emergency medical
system (EMS). Again, establish a method for a direct line
of communication in cases in which emergency transportation is not already on site. Finally, the individual
making the call should have been familiarized with the
facility location during the orientation meeting. This
will make it easier to direct EMS to the scene. Establish
a cleared route and a direct line for transportation for
quick entering and exiting ofthe facility.

Conclusion

procedures are developed to guide participant and staff
conduct and to ensure a safe training environment. If
appropriate documentation regarding the strength and
conditioning facility is not properly collected and its
equipment is not properly maintained, legal liability for
injuries can occur. Claims of negligence may be made
if injuries occur and appropriate precautions were not
taken. Strength and conditioning professionals have a
variety of responsibilities in the day-to-day operation of

a strength and conditioning facility, including an awareness of the proper function and repair of all equipment
to reduce the possibility of product liability. To provide
direction to athletes and the strength and conditioning
staff and to minimize the likelihood of litigation, each
facility should have its own unique policies and procedures manual, with guidelines included for each topic
covered in this chapter.
