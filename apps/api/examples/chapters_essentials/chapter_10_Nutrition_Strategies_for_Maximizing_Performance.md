Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

What athletes eat and drink before and during competition can affect their performance, while their postevent
meal has a greater impact on their recovery, and, if the

time period between events is less than 24 hours, performance in the next event or game. Therefore this chapter
focuses on pre-, during-, and postcompetition nutrition
while also providing guidelines for athletes who want to
lose or gain weight. In addition, no talk about weight is
complete unless it includes information on disordered
eating and eating disorders. It is imperative that the
strength and conditioning professional recognize when
an athlete may have signs and symptoms of an eating
disorder and be an active member of the treatment team.

Precompetition, During-Event,
and Postcompetition Nutrition
Athletes’ dietary practices over time will influence their
overall health and performance. In addition, what athletes eat before and during competition can have both
physiological and psychological effects on performance,
while their postcompetition meal affects recovery and
may therefore influence how they perform during their
next bout of training or competition.

Precompetition Nutrition
The precompetition meal helps provide fluid to maintain adequate hydration and carbohydrate to maximize
blood glucose and stored glycogen levels (5, 25) while
also keeping hunger pangs at bay. Glycogen is the
main form of energy used during high-intensity (>70%
VO,max) exercise; once these stores become depleted,
the athlete will experience muscular fatigue (56). Small
quantities of glycogen are stored in liver and muscle,
totaling approximately 15 g of glycogen per kilogram
body weight (1). For example, an 80 kg man can store
approximately 1,200 grams of glycogen. Glycogen
stored in the liver is used for the whole body, while
glycogen stored in muscle tissue is used by muscle (56).
Despite the vital roles that both hydration and glycogen play in athletic performance, studies examining
the importance of the precompetition meal and its
effect on performance are equivocal due to differences
in study subjects and methods used. Some show that a
high-carbohydrate preexercise meal enhances aerobic
time to exhaustion (24, 93, 113) as well as anaerobic performance in adolescent males (71), while other studies
found no effect on time-trial performance (100). Despite
these differences and the fact that studies simulating performance can’t take into account several factors that distinguish the competitive environment from a lab setting,
such as precompetition nerves, temperature, humidity,
and altitude, athletes can adapt general precompetition

guidelines based on the literature to fit their own unique
needs and the competitive environment they are in.
All precompetition meals should take timing, meal
and fluid composition, event or sport, and individual
athlete preferences into account. In order to minimize the
potential for stomach upset, smaller quantities of fluids
and food should be consumed when the precompetition
meal is consumed closer in temporal proximity to competition. Precompetition foods and beverages should be
familiar to the athlete (tried in practice), low in fat and
fiber so that they empty rapidly from the stomach and
minimize any potential for gastrointestinal distress, and
moderate in protein (protein promotes longer-lasting
satiety) (5).
Athletes can choose from either high or low glycemic
index (124) carbohydrates before competition, since the
research does not indicate that one is more advantageous
than the other (12). Even though consuming carbohydrates that rapidly increase insulin, such as glucose, will
lead to an initial drop in blood sugar at the beginning of
exercise, blood sugar levels typically return to normal
within approximately 20 minutes, and the initial drop
has no negative effect on performance (78).

Aerobic Endurance Sports
The precompetition meal may be most important for
aerobic endurance athletes who compete in long-duration
activity (>2 hours) in the morning after an overnight
fast. Upon waking in the morning, blood sugar levels
are low and liver glycogen stores are substantially
reduced. Both conditions decrease the amount of carbohydrate available for use as energy. Carbohydrates at the
precompetition meal can significantly enhance glycogen
stores and improve exercise time to exhaustion in those
who regularly include carbohydrate in their diets, when
consumed 3 or more hours before competition (27, 137).
A crossover study examined whether a precompetition high-carbohydrate meal combined with a carbohydrate-electrolyte sports drink consumed during
exercise improved aerobic endurance running capacity
(70% VO,max until exhaustion) more than the sports
drink alone (23). The scientists had men perform three
treadmill runs, each separated by one week, after an
overnight fast followed by (1) a carbohydrate meal 3
hours before exercise in addition to a carbohydrate-electrolyte sports drink during running; (2) a carbohydrate
meal 3 hours before exercise and water during running;
or (3) a low-calorie placebo drink (same flavor as the
sports drink) 3 hours before exercise and water during
running. In the two-day period before the first main trial,
subjects weighed and recorded their food intake. They
replicated the same diet for the two-day period before

each trial. No differences were noted in average daily
caloric intake between the three trials. Consumption of


Nutrition Strategies for Maximizing Performance

Minimizing Gastrointestinal Issues
To minimize the likelihood of stomach discomfort during competition, athletes should do the following:
e Try food in practice first. Always try new foods during several practice sessions before competition (5).
e

When the meal is closer in time to the start of the game or event, consume smaller amounts of food

e

Avoid high-fat and high-fiber foods. Both fat and fiber slow down the rate of digestion. When food is still
being digesting as you are exercising, you may experience stomach cramps (5).

e

Avoid sugar alcohols. Despite their name, sugar alcohols contain no alcohol. But their chemical structure resembles that of both sugar and alcohol. Sugar alcohols are a type of carbohydrate that is not
completely absorbed in the gut. Consequently, consumption can cause gas, bloating, and cramping and
may have a laxative effect. Sugar alcohols are found in some low-carbohydrate and sugar-free products,
including sugar-free gum, toothpaste, and mouthwashes.
The two sugar alcohols most likely to cause
gastrointestinal issues are sorbitol and mannitol (131). Any product that could result in consumption
of 20 g of mannitol must carry this warning on the label: “Excess consumption may have a laxative
effect.” Individual responses to sugar alcohol vary. Sugar alcohols include xylitol (the most common one
found in dental products), erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomalt, lactitol, hydrogenated starch
hydrolysates, and hydrogenated glucose syrups (131).

and liquids.

the high-carbohydrate meal preexercise improved endurance running capacity by 9% compared to the placebo
drink before exercise and water during the run. However,
the high-carbohydrate meal plus sports drink during the
run improved endurance capacity by 22% compared to
the placebo beforehand and sports drink during the run.
These results indicate that a high-carbohydrate preexercise or precompetition meal can help improve aerobic
endurance running capacity (23).
Endurance athletes who are not chronically adapted to
a low-carbohydrate diet and start exercise with depleted
glycogen stores will break down muscle to use protein
for energy and may acutely suppress immune and central
nervous system functioning. Therefore, a high-carbohydrate preexercise meal can help attenuate the breakdown
of skeletal muscle while also providing carbohydrate for
immune and nervous system functioning (20, 72). Over
time, adaptation to chronic consumption of a low-carbohydrate diet increases the body’s reliance on its vast
storage of fat as a fuel source during exercise, though
training with low glycogen stores may suppress immune
and central nervous system functioning (20, 45). In a
study examining protein catabolism, six subjects rode a
cycle ergometer for | hour at 61% VO,max after a carbohydrate loading protocol or carbohydrate depletion. In
the carbohydrate-depleted state, protein breakdown was
calculated at 13.7 g per hour, which represented 10.7%
of the calories used during exercise (72).
It is clear that a preexercise meal consumed hours
before competition can help improve aerobic endurance
performance. However, extremely early morning start
times can complicate the desire to feed with a concurrent
desire for maximum sleep. For instance, a runner who
must be at the starting line of a race at 7 a.m. may find

that waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. to eat isn’t practical. Athletes who find themselves in this scenario should practice
eating small amounts of food | to 2 hours before they
start while also ensuring that they consume an adequate
amount of carbohydrate during competition.
The following are general recommendations that
can be adapted to meet each athlete’s individual needs.
More research needs to be done to examine the needs
of athletes in a variety of sports and to determine the
effects of varying amounts of each macronutrient on
performance (95). Until this is done, the guidelines for
aerobic endurance athletes are adapted to other sports.
« Athletes should prehydrate, if necessary, several
hours before exercise to allow for fluid absorption and urine output. Their urine specific gravity
(USG) reading should be <1.020 (112).
¢ Athletes who tend to get nauseated easily, who
have experienced diarrhea during competition,
who get anxious or experience precompetition
jitters, or who compete in high-intensity sports
(jarring movements can increase the likelihood
of stomach upset), as well as those who are competing in the heat, may want to consider eating
at least 4 hours before competition. Aerobic
endurance athletes who eat at least 4 hours before
competition should include approximately | to
4 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight
and 0.15 to 0.25 g of protein per kilogram body
weight (124).

¢ If the precompetition meal is consumed 2 hours
before exercise, athletes should aim for approximately | g of carbohydrate per kilogram body
weight. Athletes should follow an individualized




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

hydration plan. During prolonged activity in hot
weather, they should consume a sports drink
containing 20 to 30 mEq of sodium (460-690 mg
with chloride as the anion) per liter, 2 to 5 mEq of
potassium (78-195 mg) per liter, and carbohydrate
in a concentration of 5% to 10% (112).
¢ When consumed closer to the start of competition, the preexercise meal should be smaller. In
addition, liquid sources of carbohydrate may be
preferable when the preexercise meal is | hour
before the event because they are emptied from
the stomach faster than solid food (5). Gels,
gummies, and similar sources of carbohydrate are
also digested very quickly. Table 10.1 summarizes
these recommendations while providing sample
food options.

Athletes may want to keep a record of their food
intake, including the time each meal or snack was consumed and how they felt while training. By recording
the types and amounts of food consumed and when these

TABLE 10.1

are consumed in relation to training, they may be able to
identify any issues they are having with performance or
stomach upset and develop a better precompetition plan.
The primary purpose of the precompetition
meal is to provide sufficient fluid to maintain
hydration and carbohydrate to maximize
blood glucose and stored glycogen while
also satisfying hunger.

Carbohydrate Loading
Depletion of muscle and liver glycogen leads to fatigue
during long-term aerobic endurance exercise (109, 123,
133). Therefore, a technique called carbohydrate loading
has been used for decades to enhance muscle glycogen
before aerobic endurance events. And though there are
many different variations of carbohydrate loading, all
include high carbohydrate intake in the days leading up
to an event to maximize glycogen stores and therefore
carbohydrate availability in the later stages of the event

Nutrition Strategies for Maximizing Performance

(25). Carbohydrate loading offers potential benefits for
distance runners, road cyclists, cross-country skiers,

and other aerobic endurance athletes who risk depleting
glycogen stores, and it may conceivably benefit other
athletes as well (105).
A commonly used carbohydrate loading regimen
includes three days of a high-carbohydrate diet in concert
with tapering exercise the week before competition and
complete rest the day before the event. The diet should

provide adequate calories and carbohydrate per day: 8
to 10 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight. This
regimen should increase muscle glycogen stores 20% to
40% above normal (25). However, higher intakes, 10 to
12 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight, have
been suggested for runners during the 36 to 48 hours
before a marathon (19).
Studies show that carbohydrate loading is effective
in men (123, 139). However, the studies in women
have been mixed. One study examined the effects of
carbohydrate loading on aerobic endurance performance
and substrate utilization in eight 20- to 40-year-old
weight-stable, eumenorrheic female runners with an
average running history of 53 km (24 miles) per week
for at least 12 months before the study aud a typical carbohydrate intake below 65% of total caloric intake (7).
Each female completed three different 24.2 km (15-mile)
self-paced treadmill performance runs after four days
on each experimental diet regimen: (1) carbohydrate
supplementation (50% of calories from carbohydrate),
(2) carbohydrate loading and supplementation (75% of
calories from carbohydrate), and (3) placebo (50% of calories from carbohydrate). Both the carbohydrate-supplemented and carbohydrate loading plus supplementation
groups consumed a 6% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution
before exercise (6 ml/kg) and every 20 minutes during
exercise (3 ml/kg). And though the carbohydrate-supplemented and carbohydrate loading plus supplementation groups used a greater portion of energy from
carbohydrate during their runs, there was no significant
difference in running performance between the groups.
However, both total calories and grams of carbohydrate
per day were not reported; therefore, it is possible that
total calorie or carbohydrate intakes (or both) were not
adequate for the runners. In addition, given the small
number of subjects included in this study, differences
in performance may have been noted if more subjects
had been included (7).
In another study, researchers found that males
increased glycogen content significantly while female
athletes did not after increasing carbohydrate intake
from 58% to 74% of calories for four days before a submaximal aerobic endurance exercise test, due to either

inadequate carbohydrate or calorie intake (or both) or
sex differences in glycogen storage (123). Ina follow-up

study, the same researchers examined glycogen storage
Capacity in six well-trained men and six well-trained
women (125). Subjects were randomly assigned to one
of three diets for four days: a high-carbohydrate diet
(75% of total calorie intake), a high-carbohydrate diet
plus extra calories (75% ofcalories from carbohydrate
and a 34% increase in total calories), or their habitual

daily diet. In men, both the higher-carbohydrate diet
and higher-carbohydrate plus extra calories diet led to
significantly greater levels of glycogen than the habitual
diet. However, in women, only the higher-carbohydrate
plus extra calories diet resulted in significant increases
in glycogen storage compared to the habitual diet. In the
high-carbohydrate conditions, men increased their total

carbohydrate intake to 7.9 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight whereas women reached just 6.4 g of
carbohydrate per kilogram body weight. No differences
were noted between men and women in their ability to
use glycogen as measured by enzymatic activity. Therefore, the failure of previous studies to show improved
performance from carbohydrate loading in women was
likely due to inadequate overall carbohydrate intake
(125). This theory (that women were not consuming
enough total carbohydrate in many of the protocols)
was backed up in a study examining female cyclists. In
trained female cyclists, three or four days on a moderate-carbohydrate diet (48% of calories from carbohydrates) followed by three or four days consuming 78%
of calories from carbohydrates (8.14 g of carbohydrate
per kilogram body weight) led to significant increases in
glycogen stores and greater cycling time to exhaustion
compared to seven days on the moderate-carbohydrate
diet (133). Researchers have found that glycogen storage
capacity in the 4-hour time period after exercise did not
differ between men and women when they consumed
the same amount of carbohydrate per unit body weight
(1 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight immediately and | hour after the completion of exercise) (122).
And while glycogen storage capacity is greater during
the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in women as
compared to the early follicular phase due to hormonal
differences, carbohydrate loading can make up for this
difference (94).
The main challenge with carbohydrate loading in
females appears to be their overall daily calorie intake.
Women who habitually consume less than 2,400 calories

per day may find it difficult to consume greater amounts
of carbohydrate. Therefore, female athletes may need to
increase their total energy intake above 2,400 calories,
in addition to consuming a higher-carbohydrate diet, in
order to increase glycogen stores (123, 133).
Though the majority of studies on carbohydrate
loading have been done in aerobic endurance athletes,
some research has attempted to examine carbohydrate




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

loading for athletes in high-intensity sports as well. In
a randomized,

crossover

design, seven professional

soccer players who consumed an average of 46% of
calories from carbohydrates ate either a 39% or a 65%
carbohydrate diet two days before being testing. Each
test consisted of 6,856 m of field work (completed at
65%, 57%, and 81% VO,max) followed by a treadmill
run to exhaustion in an attempt to mimic a soccer game.
After the high-carbohydrate diet, the players ran 17.1 km
total, which was 0.9 km longer (a significant difference)
than the distance run while on the lower-carbohydrate
diet. However, three of the athletes ran less than 420 m

longer, indicating significant variability in the athletes’
responses to a higher-carbohydrate regimen (11). The
results of this study may or may not be applicable to
soccer players, since the average distance covered in
a soccer match is considerably shorter (10.3 km with a
range of 9.7 to 11.3 km, as reported in one study), and
it is covered in an intermittent manner and at varying
levels of intensity (68).
In a study examining the effect of carbohydrate
loading on resistance exercise performance, eight
healthy young men were randomly assigned to either a
higher-carbohydrate (6.5 g of carbohydrate per kilogram
body weight) or a moderate-carbohydrate diet (4.4 g of
carbohydrate per kilogram body weight) for four days.
After this period, they participated in a resistance exercise test including four sets of 12 repetitions of maximal-effort jump squats with a load of 30% of 1-repetition
maximum (IRM) and a 2-minute rest period between
sets (44). There was no significant difference in power
performance between subjects on the high-carbohydrate
and the moderate-carbohydrate diets. Therefore, in this
study a higher-carbohydrate diet did not enhance power
performance during a four-set resistance exercise test.
However, it is unclear whether the carbohydrate loading regimen could have affected power performance if
more sets were performed or if the carbohydrate loading
regimen more closely resembled that of an endurance
athlete, providing 8-10 g carbohydrate per kilogram
bodyweight (44).
The degree of benefit derived from carbohydrate
loading varies among individuals, even among aerobic endurance athletes, and therefore athletes should
determine the value ofthis regimen while weighing any
negative side effects, such as temporary weight gain, in
practice before competition. Athletes who use carbohydrate loading as a means to maximize glycogen storage
should also know how different types of carbohydrates
affect them. For instance, oligosaccharides, which are
found in dry beans and peas, onions, and foods with
added inulin or other oligosaccharides (such as some
nutrition bars and shakes), are rapidly fermented by
bacteria in the gut, which can lead to excessive intestinal

gas and bloating. Dietary fiber is found in vegetables,
fruits, whole grains, dry beans and peas, nuts, and seeds
(130). Table 10.2 provides a sample daily meal plan for
a 68 kg (150-pound) athlete following research-based
carbohydrate recommendations for aerobic endurance
athletes.
Carbohydrate loading is an effective strategy
to maximize glycogen storage. However,
athletes must consume 8 to 10 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight per
day during the loading period to notice any
benefit from carbohydrate loading.

During-Event Nutrition
Nutrition is an important factor during aerobic endurance
events lasting greater than 45 minutes, intermittent-activity sports, or when an athlete has multiple events in one
day. Fluids and carbohydrates can affect performance,
while the provision of amino acids may minimize muscle
damage.
Proper hydration during competition is essential for
performance while also helping to prevent overheating,
dehydration, and heat illness. Athletes should hydrate
themselves several hours before exercise to allow for
fluid absorption and urine output before competing.
In addition, they should consume enough fluid during
exercise to prevent water weight losses exceeding 2% of
body weight (112). The optimal sports drink contains 20
to 30 mEq of sodium (460-690 mg with chloride as the
anion) per liter, 2 to 5 mEq of potassium (78-195 mg)
per liter, and carbohydrate in a concentration of 5% to
10% (53). Sports drinks with a higher concentration of
carbohydrate—those that contain more than 8%—delay
gastric emptying (how quickly the drink is emptied from
the stomach), which could lead to stomach discomfort
(82). Therefore a carbohydrate concentration of 6% to
8% may be ideal (112).
Fluid intake guidelines are different for children.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children weighing 40 kg (88 pounds) should drink 5 ounces
(148 ml) of cold water or a flavored salted beverage
every 20 minutes during practice, while adolescents
weighing 60 kg (132 pounds) should drink 9 ounces (256
ml) every 20 minutes even if they do not feel thirsty.
They also recommend a sodium chloride concentration
of 15 to 20 mmol/L (1 g per 2 pints), which has been
shown to increase voluntary hydration by 90% when
compared to unflavored water (4, 13, 138). Despite these

recommendations, keep in mind that 9 ounces offluid at
one time is a considerable amount for an adolescent and
may cause stomach distress. Therefore these guidelines
may need to be adjusted for individual athletes.

Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Aerobic Endurance Sports
Consuming carbohydrates during prolonged aerobic
endurance exercise can improve performance while
also reducing exercise-induced stress and suppression
of immune system functioning (90). And though sports
drinks provide carbohydrates, they cannot keep up with
an athlete’s carbohydrate utilization during prolonged,
intense activity (unless an excessive amount of fluid is
consumed). In fact, athletes who train intensely may
burn 600 to 1,200 calories or more per hour (66). Several studies show that a carbohydrate intake ranging
from 28 to 144 g per hour (with higher amounts studied
during cycling) during aerobic endurance activity can
decrease reliance on limited glycogen stores, extend time
to exhaustion, and improve performance by providing
a steady stream of carbohydrate that can be used for
energy (26, 62, 85, 128).

Despite greater intakes per hour, as noted earlier,
exogenous (external; that which is consumed) carbohydrate oxidation rates do not exceed 1.0 to 1.1 g per
minute, likely due to the rate of glucose absorption and
possibly also the limited delivery rate of 1 g per minute
of glucose into the bloodstream (61). However, each
carbohydrate has a different rate of oxidation. Glucose,
sucrose, maltose, maltodextrins, and amylopectin
are oxidized quickly; the oxidation rates of fructose,
galactose, and amylose are 25% to 50% slower (61).
In addition, each type of carbohydrate has a different
intestinal transport system. If an athlete consumes one
type of carbohydrate, fructose for instance, carbohydrate
digestion will be limited when the intestinal transporter

athlete must provide maximum effort) when subjects
were provided glucose combined with fructose versus
glucose only at a rate of 1.8 g per minute (108 g of carbohydrate per hour) (28). In addition, athletes given 36
g of glucose and fructose every 15 minutes had a better
100 km cycling time than cyclists given only glucose
every 15 minutes (128).
In addition to actually ingesting carbohydrates,
simply rinsing carbohydrates through the mouth (without
actually ingesting them) seems to improve performance
lasting approximately | hour by 2% to 3%, presumably
by affecting the central nervous system (60).
In addition to providing carbohydrates during aerobic
endurance activity, adding protein to a carbohydrate gel
led to increased time until exhaustion during a bout of
cycling while also attenuating the rise in creatine kinase
(a marker of muscle damage) during cycling, due either
to the protein itself or to the additional calories provided
by the protein (111). A meta-analysis and review of the
research examining how the addition of protein to carbohydrate affects aerobic endurance performance revealed
mixed findings (111). Only time-to-exhaustion studies
showed that the addition of protein made a significant
difference. However, these studies were not controlled

for calorie intake during the trial; therefore, it is unclear
if any benefit was due to protein or the added calories
provided by the protein. The three time-trial studies
showed no difference between carbohydrate only and
carbohydrate plus protein (120).

Intermittent High-Intensity Sports

saturated. Therefore, consum-

Many team sports, such as soccer, tennis, basketball, and

ing multiple types of carbohydrates together, such as

American football, include repeated bouts of short-duration, high-intensity activity in addition to involving a
wide range of skills. Fatigue during play could stem from
a number of factors, including decreased or depleted
glycogen stores and dehydration. The provision of both
fluids and carbohydrate is essential for performance
during prolonged intermittent sports. For instance, a long
tennis match may last 4 hours—considerably longer than
many aerobic endurance events. Because tennis players
cannot drink continuously during a match and can lose

for fructose becomes

sucrose, fructose, and glucose or maltodextrin, increases

the rate of carbohydrate absorption and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation compared to consuming an isocaloric
amount of just one sugar (58). In addition to improving
the rate of carbohydrate utilization by the body, consuming multiple types of carbohydrate during exercise was
found to improve cycling time-trial performance after
120 minutes of cycling (the study design simulated the
last few stages of an aerobic endurance race when an

Fructose and Gastrointestinal Symptoms
Fructose, a sugar found naturally in fruit and also added to a number of foods and beverages, including many
sports nutrition products, is often blamed for symptoms of stomach upset during exercise. Though some people
do not completely absorb fructose and may therefore experience bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, and
alterations in bowel functioning after consuming this sugar (116), studies have not examined gastrointestinal
symptoms related to fructose ingestion alone in athletes. Thus athletes need to test, in practice, whether
changing their sports drinks or other products they consume during training (and testing fructose-free conditions) helps alleviate any gastrointestinal symptoms they may be having (119). Athletes with irritable bowel
syndrome are more likely to have a problem absorbing fructose and therefore experience side effects (116).


Nutrition Strategies for Maximizing Performance

more than 2.5 L of fluid per hour, a recommendation of
200 to 400 ml (6.8-13.5 ounces) per changeover (switch-

ing sides) has been put forth for these athletes (65). In

addition to maintaining hydration status, research shows
that carbohydrate supplementation may not affect ratings
of perceived exertion (38) but improves stroke quality
(which includes measures of velocity, precision, and
error rate) during prolonged play (132).
In soccer players, 5 ml per kilogram body weight of
a 6.9% glucose-polymer drink, consumed 15 minutes
before each match and at halftime, made no difference

in several measures of performance such as successful
tackles, heading, dribbling, or shooting ability (142). Yet
another soccer study, this one with professional soccer
players, found that the group consuming a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage improved some parameters of
performance during match play. In this study, 22 professional male soccer players consumed the same diet for
seven days (55% of the calories were derived from carbohydrate, 25% from fat, and 20% from protein), refrained

from exercise for three days before the match, and
consumed a standardized breakfast 4 hours before the
match on game day. They were divided into two groups,
receiving either (a) a carbohydrate-electrolyte drink (7%
carbohydrates, sodium 24 mmol/L, chloride 12 mmol/L,
potassium 3 mmol/L) or (b) placebo. Each group drank
5 ml (0.17 ounces) per kilogram body weight before the
match and 2 ml (0.7 ounces) per kilogram body weight
every 15 minutes during the 90-minute game. The group
receiving the carbohydrate-electrolyte drink finished
the specific dribble test faster than those receiving the
placebo. In addition, ratings of precision were higher
in the carbohydrate-electrolyte trial versus placebo.
However, there were no differences in the coordination
or power tests between groups. In this particular study,
supplementation with a carbohydrate-electrolyte drink

improved soccer-specific skill performance compared
with a placebo (96).

In another study that found that during-play carbohydrate consumption was beneficial, a randomized,
double-blind protocol was used. Seventeen male soccer
players received 8 ml (0.27 ounces) of a 6.4% carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage per kilogram body weight
before exercise plus 3 ml (0.10 ounces) per kilogram
body weight after every 15 minutes (for a total of 52 g of
carbohydrate per hour) during a 90-minute intermittent
shuttle test (3). Consuming the carbohydrate-electrolyte
beverage attenuated a significant decrease in skill reduction from before exercise until the last 15 to 30 minutes
of exercise compared to placebo. In the carbohydrate
trial, there was a 3% reduction in skill performance
during this time period, while in the placebo trial a
15% decline in skill performance was noted. However,
this trial was performed after carbohydrate-depleting
exercise followed by a low-carbohydrate meal and then
an overnight fast; therefore, the effect of carbohydrates
on performance may depend not only on the amount
consumed during intermittent activities but also on
whether the athlete is competing in a fed or fasted and
glycogen-depleted state (3).
In another study, which used four 15-minute quarters of intermittent high-intensity shuttles at various
intensities (walking, jogging, running, sprinting, and
jumping), separated by a 20-minute rest at halftime and
followed by a shuttle run to fatigue (designed to mimic
a competitive soccer or basketball game), subjects who
consumed a carbohydrate-electrolyte (carbohydrate)
drink before exercise (5 ml of a 6% solution per kilogram
body weight) and at halftime (5 ml of a 18% solution
per kilogram body weight) ran 37% longer in the run
to fatigue than those receiving a placebo and were
significantly faster in a 20 m sprint during the fourth

During-Competition Food and Fluid Recommendations
Due to large variations in sweat rates and electrolyte concentrations, athletes should measure weight changes
during training and competition in specific weather conditions and develop individualized hydration strategies
based on this information (112). During prolonged activity in hot weather, the Institute of Medicine recommends
sports drinks containing 20 to 30 mEq of sodium (460-690 mg with chloride as the anion) per liter, 2 to 5 mEq
of potassium (78-195 mg) per liter, and carbohydrate in a concentration of 5% to 10% (53).
e

Children weighing 40 kg (88 pounds) should drink 5 ounces (148 ml) of cold water or a flavored salted
beverage every 20 minutes during practice.
e Adolescents weighing 60 kg (132 pounds) should drink 9 ounces (256 ml) every 20 minutes even if they
do not feel thirsty (4, 13).
e Aerobic endurance athletes should consume 28 to 144 g of multiple types of carbohydrates together,
such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose, or maltodextrin, each hour during prolonged aerobic endurance

activity (26, 28, 62, 85, 128).
e

Tennis players should aim for approximately 200 to 400 ml fluid per changeover and have some of this
fluid from a carbohydrate-electrolyte sports drink (65).




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

quarter. In addition, the carbohydrate-supplemented
group performed better on a whole-body motor skill test
during the later stages of exercise and reported decreased
perceptions of fatigue, indicating that the consumption of
a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage during intermittent
sports is advantageous (136).

Strength and Power Sports
Carbohydrates are also an essential source of energy used
during resistance training and therefore in strength and
power sports. Research studies using a series of different
weightlifting protocols found that participants used a
significant amount of muscle glycogen (74). Most of
these studies had participants perform just a few sets of
exercises. Therefore, athletes who perform in strength
and power competitions or sports, or in positions that
rely on muscle strength and power (hammer throwers,
offensive linemen in American football), could deplete
their muscle glycogen stores. Furthermore, starting with
already low carbohydrate stores will increase muscle
breakdown (72). Strength and power athletes can maintain their glycogen stores, which may decrease muscular
fatigue in slow-twitch fibers and possibly lead to better
performance, by supplementing with carbohydrate
before and during competition (39, 54).

Postcompetition Nutrition
The postcompetition meal helps athletes rehydrate,
replenish glycogen stores, and repair muscle tissue.
Therefore, what they consume in the time period soon
after training or competition helps prepare their body for
the next bout of activity. Each athlete’s postcompetition
needs vary based on the sport he or she plays, intensity
during play, amount of time played, the individual’s
weight and age, and probably the person’s sex. However,
much more research has been conducted with male subjects as opposed to females; therefore, recommendations
are not broken out based on sex due to a lack of sufficient
data in females.
After competition, athletes should replace fluid and
electrolyte losses. If time permits, normal meals, snacks
(provided they contain some sodium), and water will
restore fluid and electrolyte losses. More salt can be
added to foods when sweat sodium losses are substantial
(51, 112). Athletes can choose a carbohydrate-electrolyte
sports drink or plain water alongside foods that contain
sodium chloride (or they can salt their foods) since
sodium is essential for helping the body retain fluid (79,
112, 118). Rehydration strategies should be individualized as much as possible. Athletes competing in weightclass sports such as wrestling and mixed martial arts may
deliberately dehydrate themselves to make weight and
attempt to rehydrate before competition, though short
time periods between weighing and competing may

mean starting competition in a dehydrated state, leading
to poor performance and health risks.

Aerobic Endurance Events
After prolonged aerobic endurance events, it is important
to replenish carbohydrate stores before the next training
session or competition (whichever comes first) and
consume enough protein to build and repair muscle.
Glycogen synthesis occurs in two distinct phases. The
first phase is independent of insulin and lasts 30 to 60
minutes, and glycogen synthesis occurs rapidly. The
second phase lasts several hours, and glycogen synthesis
occurs at a much slower pace. Glycogen synthesis occurs
at a rapid rate when large amounts of carbohydrate, 1.0 to
1.85 g per kilogram body weight per hour, are consumed
immediately after exercise or competition and at regular
intervals every 15 to 60 minutes thereafter for up to 5
hours (57). Though athletes may be able to fully replenish their glycogen stores right away or over the course of
a 24-hour period after a long training session, this isn’t
necessarily the case after competition. Strenuous aerobic endurance events that result in measurable muscle
damage, such as the marathon, lead to delayed glycogen resynthesis even if an athlete consumes a highercarbohydrate diet, possibly due to either metabolic
disturbance or mechanical damage to muscle cells (9,
117, 134).
Though athletes are often told that they need to eat
carbohydrate immediately after they finish competing,
research shows that this isn’t always necessary; they
may be able to wait 2 hours after finishing a glycogendepleting event before eating carbohydrate. In a study
examining the rate of glycogen resynthesis, five highglycemic meals were given to athletes over the course of
a 24-hour period after a 2-hour-long glycogen-depleting
bout of cycling. One group received the first three meals
over the 4-hour period after exercise, while the second
group received the first three meals at regular 2-hour
intervals starting 2 hours after they finished over the first
6 hours after exercise. The rate of glycogen resynthesis
was the same between groups after 8 hours and after
24 hours (98). Therefore, athletes who have more than
24 hours to recover can likely wait before eating after
exercise and replace their glycogen over the 24-hour time
period after exercise as long as they consume an adequate
amount of carbohydrate. However, athletes who train
two or three times a day or have less than 24 hours to
recover may want to consider eating or drinking a highcarbohydrate meal immediately after finishing their
event and at regular intervals thereafter to quickly
replenish glycogen stores.
Because prolonged aerobic endurance exercise breaks
down muscle tissue, protein should be included in the

aerobic endurance athlete’s posttraining meal to help


Nutrition Strategies for Maximizing Performance

start muscle building and repair, which may attenuate posttraining and post-event muscle soreness (80).
Consuming protein after training has another benefit: it
increases the rate of glycogen storage if carbohydrate
intake is inadequate (i.e., <1.2 g of carbohydrate per
kilogram body weight per hour) (57). In a randomized,
controlled trial, 18 elite orienteers participated in 13
exercise sessions during one week. Half of the orienteers
(the PRO-CON group) ingested a protein drink before
(0.3 g per kilogram body weight) and a protein-carbohydrate drink after (0.3 g protein per kilogram body
weight + 1 g carbohydrate per kilogram body weight)
training. The other half of participants consumed an
isocaloric carbohydrate-only beverage before and after
exercise (CHO). Diet was kept consistent throughout
the study (15/63/22% protein/carbohydrate/fat) except
for the addition of the supplements. The basic diet +
supplements provided 3.0 g of protein per kilogram
body weight/day and 8.3 to 9.3 g of carbohydrate per
kilogram body weight/day in the PRO-CON group; the
CHO group consumed 1.8 g of protein per kilogram
body weight/day and 8.8 to 10.8 g carbohydrate per kilogram body weight/day. A 4 km run test was performed
at the beginning and end of the study and 2 hours after
participants consumed a standardized breakfast. PROCON significantly improved performance and reduced
markers of muscle breakdown, while CHO did not
improve performance. However, it isn’t clear from this

study if the timing of protein made the difference or the
increased total daily intake of protein in the PRO-CON
as compared to the CHO group (40).
Other research does suggest that protein is important
after endurance exercise. For instance, a single-blind,
randomized, triple-crossover design was used to assess
how different doses of a protein—leucine blend affected
myofibrillar protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR;
muscle protein synthesis) in 12 endurance-trained men
after 100 minutes of high-intensity cycling (performed 3
hours after a standardized breakfast; diet the day before
the test was standardized based on calorie needs and
provided the same percentage of carbohydrate, protein,
and fat for each subject). Cyclists consumed 70/15/180/
30 g protein/leucine/carbohydrate/fat, or 23/5/180/30 g,
or 0/0/274/30 g (Control) in four servings during the first
90 minutes of a 240-minute (4-hour) recovery period. The
lower-protein, lower-leucine supplement (23/5/180/30 g)
increased FSR by 33% + 12% compared to Control,
while additional protein and leucine (70/15/180/30 g)
increased FSR by 51% + 12% compared to Control.
Though no significant differences were noted between
the two protein and leucine groups, both fared better
than placebo, indicating that protein is important after
a long, tough workout (110). Given different workouts, exercise completed in a fasted or unfasted state,

and different doses of protein (10-96 g) used in other
studies, the precise minimum

dose of protein needed

to maximize FSR after endurance exercise isn’t clear
(18, 49). In addition, it isn’t clear if maximizing FSR in
the time period immediately after endurance exercise
will translate to improved performance over time. And
finally, the ideal time period after endurance training
during which protein should be consumed is not clear
and may depend on whether training was completed in
a fasted or unfasted state as well as on total daily protein
intake. However, one study found that delaying protein
intake after endurance exercise by as little as 3 hours
blunts its anabolic effects (73).

High-Intensity Intermittent Sports
Because athletes who participate in intermittent high-intensity sports—such as basketball, hockey, and soccer—

may play more than one game per day, sometimes
with just a few hours in between tournament games,
immediate recovery after a game is imperative for performance in their next game. And when competing in
sports that involve prolonged high-intensity intermittent
activity, such as soccer, American football, field and ice

hockey, rugby, and tennis, athletes may significantly
reduce their muscle glycogen stores, leading to muscular fatigue (10, 55). Fully replacing muscle glycogen
before a subsequent bout of exercise or competition may
prolong time until fatigue and improve performance. In
a study designed to mimic a soccer game, Nicholas and
colleagues had six males complete the same exercise
test separated by 22 hours on two consecutive days—75
minutes of a prolonged, intermittent, high-intensity
shuttle run test after which they completed as many 20
m shuttles as possible (each shuttle alternated between
jogging and sprinting). Subjects were assigned to one
of two diets for the 22-hour recovery period: a recovery
diet including 10 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body
weight or an isocaloric diet with more protein and fat

than their normal daily diet. Intermittent running capacity improved after the higher-carbohydrate diet as compared to the higher-calorie condition with more protein
and fat (89). Also, Balsom and colleagues found that
male study subjects performed significantly more work
in both short-term (<10 minutes) and prolonged (>30
minutes) high-intensity intermittent exercise sessions
after consuming a high- versus low-carbohydrate diet
for the 48-hour period before the exercise sessions (10).
High-intensity intermittent sports can lead to some
degree of muscle damage depending on many factors
including the time and intensity of play and body size.
Studies show that consuming protein postexercise helps
decrease some markers of muscle damage (34). The ideal
amount of protein an athlete should consume immediately after play in a game such as American football

four untrained men and four untrained women. The rate
of synthesis increased significantly above resting levels
by 112% in the 3-hour period after exercise, 65% over
the 24-hour period after exercise, and 34% over the
48-hour period after exercise. Muscle breakdown also
increased by 31% and 18% in the 3- and 24-hour periods
after exercise yet returned to baseline by 48 hours after
exercise (104). Relatively small amounts of carbohydrate, somewhere between 30 and 100 g, can sufficiently

Athletes in strength and power sports rely on both blood
glucose and glycogen for energy during competition.
Because a single bout of resistance training can lead to
significant reductions in glycogen (74) and decreases
in glycogen can impair force production and isometric
strength while accentuating muscle weakness, it is
imperative that these athletes restore glycogen levels
before their next bout of exercise (39, 54). During the
recovery period after strength and power competitions,
athletes should focus on consuming higher-glycemic
carbohydrates immediately postexercise if they must
compete or train again over the course of the 24-hour
period after the initial training session or competition.
The amount of carbohydrate they need to fully replenish
glycogen stores depends on many factors, including
intensity and the time spent competing, their overall
body weight and muscle mass, their preexercise meal
(and state of glycogen stores before competition), and
whether or not they consumed carbohydrate during the
competition. In a crossover study, after an overnight
fast, eight men who completed six sets of single-leg
knee extensions at 70% of IRM, until 50% of full knee
extension was no longer possible, depleted glycogen
levels to 71%. They replaced glycogen stores to 91%
of preexercise levels by six hours after training after
consuming 1.5 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body
weight immediately after the resistance training session
and again one hour later. However, when study subjects consumed water only immediately after training
and again one hour later, they barely increased muscle
glycogen content above depletion levels to 75% (99).
Net protein balance depends on both muscle protein
synthesis and breakdown. And though carbohydrates
have no effect on muscle protein synthesis, they help
attenuate acute protein breakdown resulting from resistance exercise. The increase in protein breakdown likely
depends on the resistance stimulus, the person’s overall
nutrition intake, and dietary intake before and during
training or competition. One study in untrained young
men found that acute protein breakdown increased by
51% + 17% after a bout of resistance training (14). In
another study, the rate of both mixed muscle protein
fractional synthesis rate (muscle protein synthesis) and
fractional breakdown rate (breakdown) were measured
after a bout of either concentric or eccentric exercise in

reduce muscle protein breakdown (16, 35). And though
muscle protein breakdown has a role in overall protein
balance, muscle protein synthesis plays a much bigger
role in overall protein balance (35).
Supplementing with protein after a muscle-damaging bout of resistance training increases acute muscle
protein synthesis. Varying amounts of protein have
been used after resistance training to stimulate muscle
protein synthesis, though maximal stimulation occurs
with 20 to 25 g (providing about 8.5 to 10 g of essential amino acids) of a high-quality, high-leucine, fast
protein (one that leads to a rapid rise in amino acids
in the bloodstream) in younger individuals, while 40 g
or more may be necessary in older adults (103). Rice
is an intermediate-speed leucine-poor protein (though
the rise in leucine in the bloodstream appears quickly
after consumption of rice protein); larger doses of rice
effectively stimulated muscle protein synthesis to the
same extent as a higher-quality protein when matched
for leucine content (63). Therefore the leucine content of
the protein, and possibly the speed of leucine delivery,
appears to be the determining factor for acute changes
in maximal stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. A
protein dose that contains 2 to 3 g of leucine or 0.05 g
of leucine per kilogram body weight will maximally
stimulate muscle protein synthesis in younger adults
(OLED TAIT):
In addition to the acute increase in muscle protein
synthesis, consistently supplementing with protein after
resistance training led to small to moderate increases in
muscle hypertrophy over time compared to conditions in
which subjects were not given protein supplements (22,
115). Only one study to date has directly examined the
relationship between acute measures of muscle protein
synthesis and hypertrophy due to resistance training.
In this study 23 young men who were recreationally
active but had not participated in a resistance training
exercise program in at least a year were tested for initial
strength and resting and postexercise rates of muscle
protein synthesis. Then they participated in a 16-week
linear resistance training program consisting of two
days of lower body (leg press, leg extension, leg curl,
and calf press) and two days of upper body (chest press,
shoulder press, seated row, lat pulldown, biceps curl,
triceps extension) exercises performed first thing in the

or soccer remains unclear at this time. And though
postexercise carbohydrate intake can affect performance
in a subsequent event or training session, particularly
when sessions are close together in time, the addition of
protein will not affect performance in a subsequent bout
of exercise during the 4-hour recovery period following
the initial event or exercise session (80).


Nutrition Strategies for Maximizing Performance

morning after an overnight fast. After exercise each day
and at breakfast on nontraining days they consumed a
nutrition drink containing 30 g of milk protein, 25.9 g of
carbohydrate, and 3.4 g of fat. The study authors found
no relationship between the acute rise (6 hours posttraining) in muscle protein synthesis due to exercise training
and the nutrition drink provided and muscle hypertrophy.
However, the authors also noted that changes in muscle
protein synthesis with training were not uniform among
study subjects; therefore, though acute changes in muscle
protein synthesis are important for muscle hypertrophy,
they are not the sole determining factor that predicts a
person’s potential to increase muscle growth (81). Thirty
grams of milk protein, as used in this study, provides an
estimated 24 g of casein, 6 g of whey protein, and a total
of 2.8 g of leucine (129).

Concurrent Training
Exercise interference is a concept suggesting that endurance exercise, when combined with strength training
(back-to-back sessions), blunts gains in strength compared to strength training alone but results in improvements in endurance performance (140). While interest
in concurrent training-based research has increased
recently, nutrition recommendations for concurrent
training are often based on isolated studies examining the

impact of nutrition interventions on endurance or resistance training alone. The consumption of carbohydrate
after endurance exercise and prelift can help suppress
skeletal muscle breakdown. Also, given the impact of
protein intake after endurance exercise on muscle pro-

tein synthesis, as well as the research suggesting that
protein intake during prolonged (>2 hours) resistance
training supports greater rates of muscle protein synthesis during exercise compared to a carbohydrate control,
athletes should consider consuming protein after endurance exercise and prelift or during their lifting session
(101).

Protein at Mealtime
In addition to consuming protein right after working
out, adults should also focus on their protein intake at
each main meal, especially since resistance training
can increase muscle sensitivity to amino acids for 24
to 48 hours after exercise whereas the anabolic effect
of a meal lasts approximately 3-5 hours. For optimal
muscle remodeling, experts suggest consuming at least
20 to 30 g of protein per meal and eating meals every 3
to 4 hours (77, 101).
The amount of data on muscle protein synthesis in
children is limited because invasive measurement procedures are required (15), and no studies have examined
muscle protein synthesis after training and postworkout
protein ingestion in healthy children. However, one
thing is clear with regard to children: They do not need
to follow the same per-meal protein guidelines as adults
because the drive for protein synthesis is regulated by
insulin and calorie intake as opposed to leucine. Children can therefore consume protein in smaller amounts
spread throughout their day to meet their protein needs
(75). For more information about protein needs by sport,
see table 10.3.

Nutrition for Various Performance Goals
Nutrition for Aerobic Endurance Performance and Recovery
Aerobic endurance athletes need to consume 8 to 10 g of carbohydrate and 1.0 to 1.6 g of protein per
kilogram body weight per day, especially if training for 90 or inore minutes.
Athletes who eat at least 4 hours before competition should include approximately 1 to 4 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight and 0.15 to 0.25 g of protein per kilogram body weight (124). If the
precompetition meal is consumed 2 hours before exercise, athletes should aim for approximately 1 g
of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight (112).

Athletes should consume 28 to 144 g of multiple types of carbohydrate (such as sucrose, fructose, and
glucose or maltodextrin) per hour during prolonged aerobic endurance exercise to extend time until
exhaustion and improve performance (26, 28, 62, 85, 128).
During prolonged activity in hot weather, athletes should consume sports drinks containing 20 to 30
mEq of sodium (460-690 mg with chloride as the anion) per liter, 2 to 5 mEq of potassium (78-195 mg)
per liter, and carbohydrate in a concentration of 5% to 10% (53).
Postexercise, approximately 1.5 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight should be consumed within
30 minutes after stopping the exercise. Some, though not all, studies show that the addition of protein
to carbohydrate postworkout may attenuate muscle breakdown and soreness and increase muscle
protein synthesis. The ideal amount of protein and the time period after exercise in which it should be
consumed are not clear based on the current body of literature and may depend on whether the exer
cise was performed in the fed versus fasted state and on total calories consumed postworkout (36, 49,
80). However, as a general guideline, at least 10 g of protein should also be consumed within a 3-hour
time period after endurance exercise (Sooner may be better, though the exact time period has yet to
be elucidated in the research) (73).
Glycogen stores should be replenished after exercise and before the next bout of training. A regular diet
with sufficient carbohydrate intake can restore glycogen over the course of a 24-hour period. For faster
glycogen synthesis, athletes should eat or drink a high-carbohydrate meal immediately after exercise
and at regular intervals thereafter. This is especially important for athletes who train again less than 24
hours after their initial training session (57).

Nutrition for Strength
Athletes should consider supplementing with carbohydrate before and during competition to maintain
strength and minimize muscle breakdown (39, 54). In general, strength/speed athletes should consume
5 to 6 g of carbohydrate per kilogram body weight per day. As little as 30 g of carbohydrate after training
may reduce muscle breakdown. The ideal time period for carbohydrate consumption postresistance
training has yet to be fully clarified; however, consuming carbohydrate sooner (rather than waiting) may
be more beneficial, particularly if training was carried out in a fasted state (35).

Because low glycogen can impair muscle force, athletes should consume higherglycemic carbohydrates
immediately following weightlifting or strength and power competitions if they must compete or train
again over the course of the 24-hour period after their initial competition. Otherwise, they can consume
enough carbohydrate over the course of the day to restore glycogen levels before the next bout of
training or competition (39, 54, 99).
In general, strength/speed athletes should consume 1.4 to 1.7 g of protein per kilogram body weight per
day, even if their sport or training includes an aerobic endurance component. After resistance training,
younger individuals should consume at least 20 to 25 g (providing about 8.5 to 10 g of essential amino
acids) of a high-quality, high-leucine protein (2-3 g), while older adults should consume 40 g or more to
maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in the acute time period after training (103). If the exercise
was performed ina fasted state (first thing in the morning or more than 3 hours after the last protein-rich
meal), the protein should be consumed within 30 minutes after the end of the session; but if the exer
cise was performed in a fed state (preexercise protein-rich meal or supplement), this postexercise time
window may be considerably longer (8).
Between 30 and 100 g of high-glycemic carbohydrates should be consumed after muscle-damaging

After resistance training, younger individuals should consume at least 20 to 25 g (providing about 8.5

consume 40 g or more to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in the acute time period after

Nutrition Strategies
for Altering Body Composition

fat-free mass, which explains approximately 70% to
80% of the difference in RMR among individuals (52,

Athletes who want to alter their body composition
typically need to gain muscle, lose body fat, or both.
Although there are some scenarios (typically in those
with eating disorders) in which an athlete may need to
gain both muscle and fat, this section focuses on gaining
muscle and losing body fat.
The first step toward altering body composition
involves estimating calorie needs (though calorie is the
common term, the technical term is kilocalorie). The
number of calories an athlete needs each day depends
on a number of factors including genetics, body weight,
body composition, training program, and age. Children
and adolescents also need calories for growth and
development.
Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is by far the largest
contributor to total energy expenditure, accounting for
approximately 65% to 70% of daily energy expenditure
(59, 107). It is a measure of the calories required for
maintaining normal body functions such as respiration,
blood circulation, and gastrointestinal and renal processing. Basal metabolic rate and resting metabolic rate
(RMR) are often used interchangeably, though they are
slightly different. Basal metabolic rate is measured after
an overnight fast (12 to 14 hours without food) with the
subject resting supine and motionless but awake (32,
52). Resting metabolic rate is often used instead of BMR
due to the ease of measurement (an overnight fast is not
required), yet it is 10% to 20% higher than BMR due to
increased energy expenditure resulting from recent food
intake or physical activity completed earlier in the day.
Several factors influence BMR and RMR, particularly

genetics, and differences in endocrine functioning (such
as hypo- or hyperthyroidism).
The second-largest component of an individual’s
energy requirement is the energy expended in physical
activity. Of all the components, it is the most variable
among individuals. The number of calories expended
through physical activity increases with the frequency,
intensity, and duration of the training program, as well as
nontraining daily activity (washing a car, doing housework, and so on). Typically, 20% to 30% of total daily
energy expenditure is from physical activity, though this
figure may be considerably higher in athletes (59, 107).
The highest energy costs are seen in aerobic activities
performed by large athletes for long periods of time,
whereas lowest energy costs are associated with skill
and power sports performed by smaller athletes.
The thermic effect of food, also known as dietinduced thermogenesis, is the increase in energy
expenditure above the RMR that can be measured for
several hours following a meal. The thermic effect of
food includes the energy cost of digestion, absorption,
metabolism, and storage of food in the body. The thermic
effect of food accounts for approximately 10% to 15%
of total calories burned each day (59, 107).
Many different equations can be used to calculate
calorie needs, including the Cunningham equation and
Harris-Benedict equation, which are prediction equations. Harris-Benedict takes sex, body weight, height,
and age into account to predict RMR. Resting metabolic
rate can then be multiplied by an activity factor from 1.2
(sedentary) to 1.9 (heavy physical activity) to predict

Weight (Fat) Loss
Athletes participating in a variety of sports may need to
lose body fat to improve aspects of performance such as
speed or endurance. Plus, regulating body weight may
give certain athletes a mental advantage going into competition (102). In addition, maintaining or making weight
is a recurring aspect of sports that include weight classes,
weight limitations, or judging based on appearance such
as weightlifting, wrestling, boxing, lightweight crew,
and gymnastics.
Despite diet books on the bestseller lists, there is
no ideal diet that works for everyone. Instead, studies
show that a variety of types of diets, including low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, result in weight loss as
long as the people following them are consuming fewer
calories than needed to maintain weight. In addition,
there appears to be no difference between the amount
of weight loss on a low-carbohydrate as compared to a
low-fat (and therefore higher-carbohydrate) diet (17, 30).
Total calorie intake and dietary adherence, the ability to
stick with a diet over time, are the two most important
factors that predict successful weight loss. However, a
good portion of weight loss during dieting may come
from muscle (135). And because muscle protein synthesis is an energy-expensive process, during times of
dieting, caloric restriction may decrease muscle protein
synthesis. Athletes who want to maintain muscle and
lose body fat while dieting should consume about 1.8
There is no one ideal diet. Instead, athletes
need to choose a dietary approach based on
whether it is safe for them, contains enough
protein to meet their needs, and fits their
lifestyle so that they can easily adhere to it.

to 2.7 g protein per kilogram body weight per day (or
approximately 2.3-3.1 g protein per kilogram fat-free
mass per day) in addition to maintaining a moderate
energy deficit of approximately 500 calories/day (84).
In order to be sustainable in the long term, diets
should be individualized, be easy to adhere to, and take
into account lifestyle habits, medical history (including
diabetes, insulin resistance, other diseases and medical

concerns), diet history, and food preferences while
providing all of the nutrients an athlete needs to train
and perform optimally. And finally, research shows
that ongoing behavior therapy and support can improve
long-lasting results (76).

Overweight and Obesity
Overweight and obesity, defined as a body mass index
(BMI) of 25 to 29.9 kg/m? and >30 kg/m’, respectively,
increase a person’s risk of morbidity from hypertension;
dyslipidemia; coronary heart disease; gallbladder disease; stroke; type 2 diabetes; sleep apnea; osteoarthritis;

respiratory problems; and endometrial, breast, prostate,
and colon cancers (86). Obesity is categorized as a disease and affects 34.9% of adults and 17% ofchildren in
the United States (92).
The causes of obesity are complex and include an
interaction of genes and environment, involving social,
behavioral, cultural, metabolic, physiological, and
genetic factors. However, many treatment options are
effective, including dietary therapy, altering physical
activity patterns, behavior therapy techniques, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. Some patients and clinicians
employ a combination of these treatments. The initial
goal for weight loss in overweight and obese individuals
should be 10% ofinitial weight within six months (86).

Low-Carbohydrate Diets
The popularity and effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets may have less to do with cutting carbohydrates (in
healthy individuals) and more to do with a temporary decrease in water weight, cutting calories, and increasing
protein intake. When people significantly reduce their carbohydrate intake, they deplete their glycogen stores
(carbohydrate stored with three to four parts water) and therefore quickly drop pounds from water weight.
Once carbohydrates are reintroduced into the diet, they can rapidly gain the weight back (67)
Over time, however, low-carbohydrate diets may work for some people because of increased levels of
protein. Protein increases feelings of fullness (satiety) in a dose-dependent manner—the more protein consumed at one sitting, the greater its effect on satiety. However, at this time the “optimal dose” for maximum
satiety remains unclear. Protein also increases the thermic effect of feeding. More calories are burned during
digesting and processing protein than carbohydrate or fat. And finally, protein helps spare metabolically active
lean muscle tissue during weight loss. This is important because muscle burns a few more calories at rest
than fat does, and over time this can affect body weight. Plus, more muscle may mean that a person can train
harder and therefore burn more calories during training (84)
Though cutting carbohydrates may be detrimental for a number of competitive athletes, particularly during
precompetition and competition phases, it is a very effective approach for someone with insulin resistance (a
condition that leads to the buildup of glucose in the blood because the body doesn't use insulin effectively),
as well as type 2 diabetes. It may also be a very effective approach for overweight and obese individuals (43,
46, 141).

Body mass index is considered a measure of body
fat calculated from height and weight. Body mass index
is often used to assess risk for diseases associated with
more body fat; however, in reality, it is a measure of

excess weight as opposed to excess body fat (86) because
BMI cannot distinguish between excess fat and muscle
or bone mass (21). Lastly, age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle
mass affect the association between BMI and body fat.

Body mass index should not be used as
a diagnostic tool but instead as an initial
screening tool to identify potential weight
issues in individuals and to track population-based rates of overweight and obesity.

Therefore, BMI can overestimate body fat in athletes
and others with muscular builds and underestimate body

fat in older persons or those who have lost muscle (86).
The same factors that affect the relationship between
BMI and body fat in adults are applicable to children.
In addition, height and sexual maturation influence a
child’s BMI. The same calculation is used for children,

but BMI interpretations for children take into account
age and sex.
Body mass index should not be used as a diagnostic
tool but instead as an initial screening tool to identify
potential weight issues in individuals and to track
population-based rates of overweight and obesity. In
addition, no single body fat measure should be used to
assess health, disease, or disease risk (21). Overweight
and obesity combined with other risk factors, including
high blood pressure, high low-density lipoprotein cho-

Waist circumference is another measure commonly
used to assess disease risk. Men have an increased relative risk for disease if they have a waist circumference
greater than 40 inches (102 cm), while women have an
increased relative risk if they have a waist circumference
greater than 35 inches (88 cm) (86).
Table 10.5 describes the various classifications of
overweight and obesity. For reference, table 10.6 provides the weights and heights that correspond to BMIs
of 25, 27, and 30. Table 10.7 lists BMI categories for
corresponding percentile rankings for children. For more
information about the screening process and risk assessment, refer to Clinical Guidelines on the Identification,

Calculating BMI
To estimate BMI using kilograms and meters, use this equation:
Weight (kilograms) / Height (meters)?
To estimate BMI using pounds and inches, use this equation:
[Weight (pounds) / Height (inches)?] x 703

Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m? and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m? or more.

overestimate overweight and obesity (70).
Although all obese individuals share the trait of excess
body fat, they cannot be treated homogeneously. They
must be screened for coexisting illnesses such as diabetes, orthopedic problems, cardiac disease, psychological
disorders such as binge-eating disorder or depression,
social and cultural influences, and readiness for change.
Obese athletes who are mandated to lose weight (e.g.,
by a physician) pose a special challenge because losing
weight is dictated by an external source and is not an
internalized goal. Weight loss takes a great deal of dedication from within the individual, and these athletes may
need to work closely with a mental health professional
or registered dietitian to help them meet their goal.

Though there is no uniform definition in the literature,
rapid weight loss generally refers to quick weight loss,
faster than can be achieved by lowering calorie intake
and increasing exercise, in a short period of time (29).
Athletes may use any variety of techniques to cut weight
quickly in order to compete in a desired weight class,
meet a weight goal set by their coach, or improve performance. Potentially dangerous weight loss techniques
may include fasting, fad diets, voluntary dehydration
(diuretics, sauna, water and salt manipulation, wearing
multiple layers of clothing), excessive spitting, self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, and inappropriate or
excessive use of thermogenic aids (29).
Athletes who attempt to lose too much weight too
quickly may lose lean body mass, feel fatigued, experience headaches or mood swings, put their training
and performance in jeopardy, and suffer from several
potentially serious side effects. These include dehydration, heat illness, muscle cramping, fatigue, dizziness,

with rapid weight loss techniques and refer athletes to
the appropriate professional while also communicating
concerns to the rest of the coaching staff. In addition,
the strength and conditioning professional may want to
consider documenting the steps he or she has taken to
assist the athlete (for good record keeping and to prevent
liability) while also working with a medical doctor or
registered dietitian to set appropriate weight goals after
body composition, dieting, medical, and eating disorder
history have been taken into account. Some athletes may
need to reconsider which weight class they are competing in if they cannot make weight without putting their
health or performance in jeopardy.

Feeding and Eating Disorders
Eating disorders, including binge-eating disorder,
anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa, are serious

mental health disorders that can affect both men and
women, appear at any point in life, and increase risk
of mortality. Those with eating disorders have a high
prevalence of other psychiatric disorders, including
anxiety disorders, mood disorders such as depression,
impulse-control disorders, and substance abuse disorders

(41, 50).
Studies show an increased prevalence of both disordered eating and eating disorders in athletes compared
to controls (37, 121, 143). In particular, athletes in

sports with weight classes such as wrestling, those in
sports that emphasize leanness such as cross-country
running, and aesthetic sports such as gymnastics may
be more prone to disordered eating and eating disorders
(37, 121, 143). Signs of disordered eating may include
restrictive eating, fasting, skipping meals, and taking

diet pills, laxatives, or diuretics. However, those with
disordered eating do not meet the full diagnostic criteria
for an eating disorder (37).
Eating disorders are multifactorial diseases and, as
such, require a multidisciplinary team approach. The
strength and conditioning professional must be aware
of signs and symptoms ofan eating disorder and have
a referral network in place so athletes can get the psychological, medical, and nutrition help they need from
experts who work with eating disorders.

Anorexia Nervosa
Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a distorted body
image and an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming
fat, leading those with this disease to excessive calorie restriction and severe weight loss (6). Those with
anorexia nervosa also put a great deal of emphasis on
their weight or shape yet do not recognize the seriousness
oftheir illness. Also, people with anorexia nervosa typically engage in ritualistic behaviors including repeated
weighing, cutting food into small pieces, and carefully
portioning their food (87).
Two subtypes fall under anorexia nervosa. The
restricting type does not regularly binge eat or purge,
while the binge-eating or purging type regularly engages
in binge eating or purging.
The average age ofonset is 19 years old, and the lifetime prevalence in females and males is 0.9% and 0.3%,
respectively. Just 33.8% of those with anorexia nervosa
are in treatment (50). However, these statistics are based
on older criteria for anorexia nervosa; prevalence rates
may go up with the 2013 revised diagnostic criteria (48).
It is important to note that among ali mental health disorders, anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate

Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (2013).

Binge-Eating Disorder
Previously categorized under “eating disorder not otherwise specified,” binge-eating disorder has its own category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (6). Binge-eating disorder is
characterized by repeated episodes, occurring at least
once a week for a period of three weeks, of uncontrolled
binge eating (eating significantly more food in a short
period of time than most people would eat under the
same circumstances) (6). The binge-eating episodes are
associated with three or more of the following:
¢ Eating much more rapidly than normal
* Eating until feeling uncomfortably full
¢ Eating large amounts of food when not feeling
physically hungry
¢ Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by
how much one is eating

* Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very
guilty afterward (6)
Because binge-eating episodes are not followed by
purging, as is the case with bulimia nervosa, people
with binge-eating disorder are often overweight or
obese. The lifetime prevalence for men and women is
2.0% and 3.5%, respectively, and average age of onset
is 25 years old. A lifetime prevalence of binge-eating
disorder is associated with morbid obesity (BMI >40).
Over the course of a lifetime, only 43.6% of people
with binge-eating disorder are receiving treatment (50).
However, these statistics are based on older criteria for

binge-eating disorder, before its inclusion as a specific

eating disorder in 2013. Prevalence rates may go up
with the revised criteria (48). Binge eating is associated
with significant physical and psychological problems.
In addition, people with binge-eating disorder may feel
embarrassed, guilty, or disgusted with their’ behavior
and may attempt to hide their behavior by eating alone

(6).
Bulimia Nervosa
Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent consumption of food in amounts significantly greater than
would customarily be consumed in a discrete period of
time—for example, an entire pizza and a half-gallon of
ice cream, plus a package of cookies. Purging follows
episodes of binge eating and may include one or more of
the following: self-induced vomiting, intense exercise,
laxative use, or diuretic use. The binging and purging
occur at least once a week for a period of three months
(6). People with bulimia nervosa feel a lack of control
over their eating during binge episodes and are more
likely to be normal weight as opposed to underweight,
are unhappy with their weight and body, and fear weight
gain. Average age of onset for bulimia nervosa is 20 years
old, and the lifetime prevalence is 0.6%. Only 43.2%
of those with bulimia nervosa are receiving treatment
(50). However, these statistics are also based on older
criteria for bulimia nervosa, and prevalence rates may
go up with the revised criteria in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(48). For more information about bulimia, the reader is
encouraged to read this source.

Avoidant/Restrictive Food
Intake Disorder
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is an

characteristics of food; or concern about aversive con-

sequences of eating. This disorder is manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional or energy
needs associated with one (or more) of the following (6):
* Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve
expected weight gain or faltering growth in
children)
* Significant nutritional deficiency
* Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional
supplements

* Marked interference with psychosocial functioning
The disturbance is not better explained by lack of
available food or by associated culturally sanctioned
practice.
The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively
during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa,
and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in
which one's body weight or shape is experienced.
The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not better explained by
another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance
occurs in the context of another condition or disorder, the

severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely
associated with the condition or disorder and warrants
additional clinical attention (6).

Pica
People with pica eat nonnutritive substances for a period
of at least one month. Common nonnutritive substances
include clay, laundry starch, ice, cigarette butts, hair, or
chalk (64). Those with pica may have electrolyte and

metabolic disorders, intestinal obstruction, wearing away
of tooth enamel, and gastrointestinal problems, among
other issues. Testing for anemia is recommended since
pica is associated with iron deficiency (64).

Rumination Disorder
Rumination involves chewing, reswallowing, or spitting
ofregurgitated food. To be classified as having this disorder, one must display this behavior, unrelated to any
medical condition, for at least one month.
Rumination disorder can occur alongside other eating
issues or disorders (6).

Eating Disorders: Management and Care
It is not the responsibility of the strength and conditioning professional to treat or diagnose an eating disorder. It
is his or her ethical responsibility to assist the athlete in
attaining the proper diagnosis from a qualified physician
and treatment from a qualified treatment team. Therefore, strength and conditioning professionals should
be mindful of the symptoms of each eating disorder as
well as signs of disordered eating. Keep in mind that
abnormal eating patterns and amenorrhea alone are not
indicative of an eating disorder. A professional who is
experienced and qualified in diagnosing and treating
eating disorders should be contacted when an athlete’s
behavior is concerning.
The strength and conditioning professional
is not responsible for treating eating disorders but instead should be aware of the
symptoms associated with an eating disorder and refer athletes to the appropriate
professional.

Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Conclusion
The primary role of nutrition in strength and conditioning is to support athletic performance. A general
understanding of nutrition principles and applications
is essential for strength and conditioning professionals
so that they can provide consistent, accurate informa-

tion to their athletes while also being able to identify
the potential signs and symptoms of an eating disorder.
And though pre-, during-, and postcompetition nutrition can lead to better performance, a nutritionally
sound daily diet should be emphasized as well, for
overall health, greater training adaptations, and
performance.
