Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Characterized by high-intensity, intermittent bouts of
exercise, anaerobic training requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to be regenerated at a faster rate than
the aerobic energy system is capable of. Consequently,
the difference in energy requirement is made up by the
anaerobic energy system, which works in the absence
of oxygen and includes the anaerobic alactic system
(also known as the phosphagen or creatine phosphate
system) and the anaerobic lactic system (also known
as the glycolytic system). Long-term adaptations that
occur in response to anaerobic training are specifically
related to the characteristics of the training program. For
example, improvements in muscular strength, power,
hypertrophy, muscular endurance, motor skills, and
coordination are all recognized as beneficial adaptations
following anaerobic training modalities. These include
resistance training; plyometric drills; and speed, agility,
and interval training. The aerobic system ultimately has
limited involvement in high-intensity anaerobic activities, but does play an important role in the recovery of
energy stores during periods of low-intensity exercise
or rest (45).
Exercises such as sprints and plyometric drills primarily stress the phosphagen system; they are usually
less than 10 seconds in duration and minimize fatigue by
allowing almost complete recovery between sets (e.g.,
5-7 minutes). Longer-duration interval-type anaerobic
training predominantly uses energy production from
the glycolytic system, in which shorter rest intervals
(e.g., 20-60 seconds) are adopted during high-intensity
exercise. The integration of high-intensity exercise with
short rest periods is considered an important aspect of
anaerobic training, as athletes are often required to perform near-maximally under fatigued conditions during
competition. It is, however, critical that appropriate
anaerobic training be programmed and prescribed in
such a way as to optimize the physiological adaptations
that determine performance. Competitive sport requires
the complex interaction of all the energy systems and
demonstrates how each of them contributes to a varying
extent in order to fulfill the global metabolic demands
of competition (table 5.1).
A wide variety of physical and physiological adaptations are reported following anaerobic training, and
these changes enable individuals to improve athletic
performance standards (see table 5.2). Adaptations
include changes to the nervous, muscular, connective

tissue, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems. They
range from changes that take place in the early phase
of training (e.g., one to four weeks) to those that take
place following many years of consistent training. The
majority of research has typically dealt with adaptations
in the early to intermediate stages oftraining (i.e., 4 to
24 weeks). Understanding how the individual systems

of the human body respond to physical activity using
anaerobic metabolism provides a knowledge base from
which the strength and conditioning professional can
plan and predict the outcome of a specific training program to then focus on effectively influencing individual strengths and weaknesses.

Neural Adaptations
Many anaerobic training modalities emphasize the
expression of muscular speed and power and depend
greatly on optimal neural recruitment for maximal
performance (and high quality of training). Anaerobic
training has the potential to elicit long-term adaptations
throughout the neuromuscular system, beginning in the
higher brain centers and continuing down to the level of
individual muscle fibers (figure 5.1). Neural adaptations
are fundamental to optimizing athletic performance,
and increased neural drive is critical to maximizing the
expression of muscular strength and power. Augmented
neural drive is thought to occur via increased agonist
(i.e., the major muscles involved in a specific movement
or exercise) muscle recruitment, improved neuronal
firing rates, and greater synchronization in the timing of
neural discharge during high-intensity muscular contractions (4, 69, 166, 167, 174). In addition, a reduction in
inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., from Golgi tendon organs)
is also thought to occur with long-term training (1, 63).

While it is not fully understood how these complex
responses coexist, it is apparent that neural adaptations
typically occur before any structural changes in skeletal
muscle are apparent (167).

Central Adaptations
Increased motor unit activation begins in the higher brain
centers, where the intent to produce maximal levels of
muscular force and power causes motor cortex activity
to increase (41). As the level of force developed rises,
or when a new exercise or movement is being learned,
primary motor cortex activity is elevated in an effort to
support the enhanced need for neuromuscular function.
Adaptations to anaerobic training methods are then
reflected by substantial neural changes in the spinal cord,
particularly along the descending corticospinal tracts
(3). Indeed, after use of anaerobic training methods, the
recruitment of fast-twitch motor units has been shown
to be elevated as a means to support heightened levels
of force expression (151). This is in comparison to what
is seen in untrained individuals (4), in whom the ability

to maximally recruit motor units is limited, especially
fast-twitch motor units. In untrained individuals or in
those rehabilitating from injury, electrical stimulation
has been shown to be more effective than voluntary

activations in eliciting beneficial gains. This response
further indicates the potential inability of these populations to successfully activate all available muscle fibers.
Indeed, research has shown that only 71% of muscle
tissue is activated during maximal efforts in untrained
populations (7).

fibers for large, powerful trunk and limb muscles. When
expression of maximal force is desired, all the available

motor units must be activated within a muscle. Change

in the firing rate or frequency of the motor unit also
affects the ability to generate force. Increased force
with greater firing rates reflects the summation of successive muscle contractions, whereby action potentials
temporarily overlap. With increased motor unit firing
rates, the muscle fibers are continually activated by
subsequent action potentials before they have time to

completely relax following a prior action potential. The
summation of overlapping action potentials is expressed
as augmented contractile strength (1). These firing rates
represent an adaptive mechanism shown to improve following heavy resistance training (166). Gains in maximal
strength and power of agonist muscles are generally
associated with (a) an increase in recruitment; (b) an
increased rate of firing; (c) greater synchronization of
neural discharge, which acts to coordinate the activity of
multiple muscles in synergy (173); or (d) a combination
of all these factors.
The recruitment or decruitment of motor units in an
orderly manner is governed by the size principle (figure
5.2), which represents the relationship between motor
unit twitch force and recruitment threshold (166, 167).
According to this principle, motor units are recruited
in an ascending order according to their recruitment
thresholds and firing rates. This represents a continuum
of voluntary force in the agonist muscle. Because most
muscles contain a range of Type I and Type II muscle
fibers, force production can range from very low to maximal levels. Those motor units high in the recruitment
order are used primarily for high force, speed, or power
production. As the demands of force expression increase,
motor units are recruited in a sequential fashion from
low- to high-threshold motor units. Thus, with heavy

some extent in order to produce the higher levels of force
required to lift progressively heavier loads. Maximal
force production not only requires the recruitment of a
maximum percentage of available motor units, including
the high-threshold motor units, but also relies on the
recruitment occurring at very high firing frequencies,
which promotes the summation of activated motor
units and as a consequence augments the magnitude of
contractile activity. Once a motor unit is recruited, less
activation is needed in order for it to be rerecruited (69).
This phenomenon may have important ramifications
for strength and power training, as the high-threshold
motor units may be more readily reactivated subsequent
to prior recruitment.
Exceptions to the size principle do exist. Under

resistance training, all muscle fibers get larger (77, 183,

order benefits high-velocity training modalities in which
rate of force production is vital to success. For example,
it would be very difficult for athletes to generate enough
angular velocity and power to attain maximal height
for the vertical jump if they had to recruit the entire
slow-twitch motor unit pool before activation of the fasttwitch units. As the time between the countermovement
and the subsequent jump takeoff is often less than 0.4

certain circumstances, an athlete is able to inhibit the

lower-threshold motor units and in their place activate
higher-threshold motor units (148, 189). This selective

recruitment is critical when force production is required
at very high speeds for the expression of muscular power.
Indeed, both rapid changes in the direction offorce production and ballistic muscular contractions—as found in
the movement patterns of Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, speed, power, and agility training—have been
shown to lead to preferential recruitment of fast-twitch
motor units (148, 189). This variation in recruitment

seconds, there simply is insufficient time to recruit all of

the motor units in order and still perform an explosive
jump (4, 113). Instead, selective recruitment appears
to be a beneficial intrinsic neural mechanism favoring
explosive exercise. In addition, using specific training
methods may enhance selective recruitment, which in
turn may improve sport performance (149).

FIGURE 5.2 Graphic representation of the size principle, according to which motor units that contain Type |
(slow-twitch) andType II (fast-twitch) fibers are organized
based on some “size” factor. Low-threshold motor units
are recruited first and have lower force capabilities than
higher-threshold motor units. Typically, to get to the
high-threshold motor units, the body must first recruit
the lower-threshold motor units. Exceptions exist,
especially with respect to explosive, ballistic contractions that can selectively recruit high-threshold units to
rapidly achieve more force and power.

With heavy resistance training, all muscle
fibers get larger (i.e., hypertrophy) because
motor units are recruited in a sequential
order by their size to produce high levels of
force. In advanced lifters, the central nervous
system may adapt by allowing well-trained
athletes to recruit some motor units in a
nonconsecutive order, by recruiting larger
ones first to promote greater production of
power or speed in a movement.

Another critical element of adaptation in neural
recruitment is the level oftissue activation that results




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

from chronic resistance training for muscular hypertrophy. Research has shown that as muscle size increases it
does not require as much neural activation to lift a given
load. Ploutz and colleagues (157) reported that fewer
quadriceps muscle fibers were activated when subjects
lifted a set load following nine weeks of resistance
training that resulted in a 5% increase in muscle size.
Such results demonstrate the importance of progressive
overloading during resistance training and how it promotes the continual recruitment of an optimal amount
of muscle tissue.
Other motor unit adaptations include changes in the
rate and sequence of firing. A positive relationship exists
between the magnitude of force produced and the rate
of motor unit firing; high firing rates from the onset of
ballistic muscle contraction are especially critical to
increased rates of force development (1). The increase
in firing rate (vs. recruitment) appears to be dependent
on muscle size, such that smaller muscles rely more
on an increased firing rate to enhance force production
whereas larger muscles depend more on recruitment
(48, 63). Evidence suggests that anaerobic training can
play a role in enhancing firing rates of recruited motor
units (4). For example, resistance training may result in
a more synchronized pattern (1.e., the firing of two or
more motor units at a fixed interval) of activation during
the exertion of large forces, rather than the customary
asynchronous pattern usually common to motor function (50, 174). Although the specific role of motor unit
synchronization during anaerobic training remains to
be fully elucidated, synchronization is potentially more
critical to the timing of force production and less significant with regard to the overall level of force developed.

Neuromuscular Junction
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the interface

that anaerobic training appears to induce beneficial
morphological changes in the NMJ that are conducive
to enhanced neural transmission capabilities.

Neuromuscular Reflex Potentiation
Anaerobic training causes positive changes in the reflex
(i.e., muscle spindle or stretch reflex) response of the
neuromuscular system and enhances the magnitude and
rate of force development via this reflex. This myotatic
reflex harnesses the involuntary elastic properties of
the muscle and connective tissue and acts to positively
increase force production without any additional energy
requirement. Resistance training in particular has been
shown to increase reflex potentiation by between 19%
and 55% (5). Furthermore, resistance-trained athletes
(weightlifters, bodybuilders) are found to have greater
reflex potentiation in the soleus muscle compared to
untrained individuals (170).

Anaerobic Training
and Electromyography Studies
Electromyography (EMG) is a common research tool
used to examine the magnitude of neural activation
within skeletal muscle. Two kinds of EMG are commonly used in research and applied settings: surface
EMG and intramuscular (needle or fine wire) EMG.
Surface EMG requires placement of adhesive electrodes
on the surface of the skin where they are able to monitor a large area of underlying muscle (152). Surface
EMG is often more effective for monitoring superficial
muscle, as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of
superficial muscles and detect deeper muscle activity.
Also, the more body fat an individual has, the weaker
the EMG signal is likely to be with use of this methodology. In comparison, with intramuscular EMG, the skin

between the nerve and the skeletal muscle fibers, and

surface is numbed, and a needle electrode, or a needle

it represents another potential site for neural adaptation
following anaerobic training (38, 39). Because of the
difficulty in investigating this structure, most studies examining the NMJ have used animal models to
demonstrate its adaptation to exercise. Deschenes and
colleagues (40) examined the impact of high-intensity
versus low-intensity treadmill exercise training on NMJ
in the soleus muscle of rats. Following both high- and
low-intensity running, the NMJ was found to increase
in its total area. High-intensity training, however,
resulted in more dispersed, irregular-shaped synapses
and a greater total length of nerve terminal branching
compared to low-intensity training. In another study,
greater end-plate perimeter length and area, as well as
greater dispersion of acetylcholine receptors within the
end-plate region, were also found after seven weeks
of resistance training (39). These adaptations suggest

containing two fine-wire electrodes, is inserted through
the skin and positioned into the belly of the muscle itself.
Fine-wire electrodes emphasize a specificity of assessment in that they are located in a muscle of interest and
accurately record localized motor unit action potentials
(85). Because of its invasiveness, intramuscular EMG is
primarily adopted in research settings or under clinical
conditions. While it is often difficult to determine the
specific underpinning mechanism(s) (i.e., increased
recruitment, discharge rate, or synchronization; Golgi
tendon organ inhibition) affecting EMG output, an
increase in EMG signal indicates greater neuromuscular
activity.
An important consideration when examining the
neuromuscular system is the training status of an individual. Neural adaptations (improved motor learning and
coordination) predominate in the early phase of training


Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Program:

without any concomitant increases in muscle hypertrophy (73, 75-77). In addition, the onset of hypertrophy
is associated with a decline in EMG activity (145). It
appears that as an individual’s training status advances,
there exists an interplay between neural and hypertrophic
mechanisms that contribute to further gains in strength
and power.
Sale (166, 167) reported that dramatic increases
in neural adaptation take place in the early part of a
training program (6 to 10 weeks). As the duration of
training increases (>10 weeks), muscle hypertrophy
then occurs, and it is these structural changes that contribute to strength and power gains more than neural
adaptations. Eventually muscle hypertrophy plateaus as
accommodation to the training load occurs. However,
at that time, if an athlete incorporates new variation or
progressive overload into the training plan, neural adaptations will once again contribute to the performance
improvements by acting to tolerate the “new” physical
insult from training. This pattern is replicated with every
stepwise change in the training demand, and as athletes
progress in training, the type of program used may be
one of the most important factors to consider (77, 80,

161). Neural factors are especially important for strength
gains in programs that use very high training intensities
(>85% of |-repetition maximum [1RM]) (145). Training
programs designed to elicit muscular power also provide
a potent stimulus to the nervous system and result in
higher posttraining EMG activity (149).
Electromyography studies have also yielded some
interesting findings regarding neural adaptations to
anaerobic training:
¢ Exercising muscle undergoing unilateral resistance training produces increased strength and
neural activity in the contralateral resting muscle,
a phenomenon known as cross-education (89). A
review of the literature has shown that strength in
the untrained limb may increase up to 22%, with
an average strength increase of approximately 8%
(147). The increase in strength of the untrained
limb is accompanied by greater EMG activity in
that limb (176), thereby suggesting that a central
neural adaptation accounts for the majority of
strength gains.
¢ In untrained individuals, a bilateral deficit is

evident. The force produced when both limbs
contract together is lower than the sum of the
forces they produce when contracting unilaterally.
Research has shown that the corresponding EMG
activity is lower during bilateral contractions (63),
suggesting that neural mechanisms are, at least in
part, a contributing factor. With longitudinal bilateral training, the magnitude of the bilateral deficit

is reduced. In fact, trained or stronger individuals
often show a bilateral facilitation effect in which
an increase in voluntary activation of the agonist
muscle groups occurs (15, 171).

* The EMG activity of antagonist muscle groups
has been shown to change in response to anaerobic training during agonist movements. In most
instances, cocontraction of antagonist muscles
serves as a protective mechanism to increase
joint stability and reduce the risk of injury (96).
However, when too much antagonist activity
opposes agonist movement, it creates a resistance
to maximal force production. A number ofstudies
have shown reduced antagonist cocontraction following resistance training, resulting in an increase
in net force without an increase in agonist motor
unit recruitment (26, 76, 151). Elsewhere, sprint

and plyometric training have also been shown to
alter the timing of cocontractor activation (96).
The specific role ofaltering antagonist cocontraction patterns remains unclear. Greater antagonist
activity may be observed during ballistic movements that require high levels ofjoint stability, or
when people are unfamiliar with a task and require
more inherent stability (48).

Muscular Adaptations
Skeletal muscle adaptations following anaerobic training occur in both structure and function, with reported
changes encompassing increases in size, fiber type
transitions, and enhanced biochemical and ultrastructural

components (i.e., muscle architecture, enzyme activity,
and substrate concentrations). Collectively, these adaptations result in enhanced performance characteristics
that include strength, power, and muscular endurance,
all of which are critical to athletic success.

Muscular Growth
Muscle hypertrophy is the term given to the enlargement of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) following training. A positive relationship exists between
hypertrophy and the expression of muscular strength.
Biologically, the process of hypertrophy involves an
increase in the net accretion (i.e., an increase in synthesis, reduction in degradation, or both) of the contractile
proteins actin and myosin within the myofibril, as well
as an increase in the number of myofibrils within a
muscle fiber. In addition to these contractile proteins,
other structural proteins such as titin and nebulin are
also synthesized proportionately to the myofilament
changes. The new myofilaments are added to the
periphery of the myofibril and result in an increase in




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

its diameter. The cumulative effect of these additions is
an enlargement of the fiber and, collectively, the size of
the muscle or muscle group itself. During exposure to
mechanical loading (e.g., resistance training), a series
of intracellular processes regulate gene expression and
subsequently promote increased protein synthesis (165).
Mechanical deformation of muscle stimulates various
proteins independent of hormone concentrations, and
these proteins have been shown to increase in activity
before evidence of muscle hypertrophy appears. In
particular, mechanical tissue deformation activates the
protein kinase B (Akt)—-mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway, the adenosine monophosphate—
activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Of
these, the Akt/mTOR pathway in particular is important
in directly regulating adaptations to resistance training
(179). When muscle fibers contract, Akt/mTOR signaling increases dramatically, and this response is critical
for increasing muscle protein synthesis and subsequent
growth (a process known as myogenesis). At the same
time, the downregulation of inhibitory growth factors
(e.g., myostatin) suggests that resistance exercise significantly affects a plethora of growth-signaling and
breakdown pathways (18, 98, 101). Protein synthetic
rates are elevated after acute resistance exercise and
remain elevated for up to 48 hours (130, 156). The
magnitude of increased protein synthesis depends on
a variety of factors including carbohydrate and protein
intake, amino acid availability, timing of nutrient intake,
mechanical stress of the weight training workout, muscle
cell hydration levels, and the anabolic hormonal and
subsequent receptor response (19, 115, 162).
The process of hypertrophy involves both
an increase in the synthesis of the contractile proteins actin and myosin within the
myofibril and an increase in the number
of myofibrils within the muscle fiber itself.
The new myofilaments are added to the
external layers of the myofibril, resulting in
an increase in its diameter.

Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) and disruption of myofibrils and the uniform structure of muscle
fiber sarcomeres following high-intensity anaerobic
training (e.g., resistance training) also have a marked
effect on muscle growth. The theoretical basis for this
suggests that structural changes associated with EIMD
influence gene expression in an effort to strengthen
muscle tissue and protect it from further damage. The
repair and remodeling process itself may involve a host
of regulatory mechanisms (e.g., hormonal, immune, and
metabolic) that interact with the training status of the
individual (105, 193). However, it is understood that

both the inflammatory responses and increased protein
turnover (i.e., increased net protein synthesis) ultimately
contribute to long-term hypertrophic adaptations (179).
The sequence of protein synthesis involves (a) water
uptake, (b) noncontractile protein synthesis, and (c)
contractile protein synthesis (192). At the same time,
reduced degradation acts to maintain the size of fibers
by reducing net protein loss.
After the initiation of a heavy resistance training program, changes in the type of muscle proteins (e.g., fast
myosin heavy chains) start to take place within several
appropriately timed workouts (113, 183). However,
muscle fiber hypertrophy requires a longer period of
training (>16 workouts) before significant changes in
CSA actually become apparent (185). As with initial
gains in performance variables (e.g., strength, power),
hypertrophic responses are at their greatest in the early
stages, after which the rate of muscle growth diminishes
over time (113). Athletes studied across two years of
heavy resistance training showed increases in strength
that paralleled optimal training intensities, although
muscle fiber hypertrophy contributed little to increased
lifting performance (80).
The magnitude of hypertrophy ultimately depends on
the training stimulus and the manner in which the acute
training variables are prescribed. In order to optimize
muscle growth, appropriate training periodization is
essential for maximizing the combination of mechanical
and metabolic stimuli. Mechanical factors include the
lifting of heavy loads, the inclusion of eccentric muscle
actions, and moderate to high training volumes (114),
all of which are characteristic of strength training. An
increasing amount of evidence is also supporting the
use of novel training modalities (e.g., occlusion training
[177]) as alternative methods of inducing appropriate
mechanical or metabolic stress. Metabolic factors center
on low- to moderate-intensity or moderately high-intensity training with high volumes and short rest intervals
(characteristic of bodybuilding training) (114). Collectively, mechanical factors result in optimal recruitment
of muscle fibers (as muscle fibers need to be recruited
before growth), growth factor expression, and potential
disruption to the sarcomeres, all of which increase
muscle CSA (67, 161). The metabolic factors stress the
glycolytic energy system and result in increased metabolites that may be involved in muscle growth. These
programs also elicit the most potent anabolic hormone
response (115).
Also proposed as a mechanism for increasing muscle
size, and something that has been debated by exercise scientists for years, is hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is the term
given to an increase in the number of muscle fibers via
longitudinal fiber splitting in response to high-intensity
resistance training. Hyperplasia has been shown to occur


Adaptations to Anaerobic

in animals (68, 87), but the findings are controversial

in humans, with some studies providing support (129,
132, 191) and others rejecting its occurrence in humans
(131). Part of the reason for this confusion may arise
from cross-sectional studies comparing resistancetrained athletes to untrained individuals, showing a
greater number of fibers in the trained population. In
this scenario it is difficult to determine if the difference
is due to genetics or hyperplasia. One must also consider
that the procedures scientists perform on animals simply
cannot be done on humans for ethical and logistical reasons. Consequently, some of the more convincing data
supporting skeletal muscle hyperplasia emerge from
animal studies (68, 87). When examining hyperplasia in
animal models, researchers remove whole muscle and

strip back the fascia in order to analyze muscle fiber
numbers longitudinally under a microscope. In humans,
removal of whole muscle is not feasible. Instead, needle

biopsies techniques are used to harvest a small sample of
muscle tissue, which is then examined in cross section,

and a prediction of hyperplasia is made indirectly from
extrapolation mathematics. While hyperplasia cannot
be completely ruled out, it does not appear to be a
major strategy for muscle tissue adaptation to resistance
training; and, if it occurs at all, it involves only a small
amount of the stimulated tissue (maybe less than 10%)
if the conditions are optimal. It may be hypothesized that

if hyperplasia occurs, it may be in response to muscle
fibers reaching a theoretical upper limit in size, which
may occur in athletes using anabolic steroids and other
growth agents or undergoing long-term training that
produces large to extreme levels of hypertrophy. This
remains to be fully elucidated and continues to be an area
of contention among scientific researchers.

Fiber Size Changes
The magnitude of muscle hypertrophy experienced
following anaerobic training is intimately associated
with muscle fiber type. Muscle fibers, in particular
those within the high-threshold motor units governed
by the size principle, must be activated in order to promote significant hypertrophy (36). During resistance
training, both Type I and Type II muscle fibers have the
potential to be recruited, with the frequency at which
they are recruited ultimately determining the extent of
their adaptive processes. According to the size principle,
only following hierarchical activation do Type I or Type
II fibers receive a signaling mechanism that initiates
the cascade of regulatory processes promoting protein
synthesis. Collectively, however, following muscle fiber
activation these hypertrophic responses translate into
enlarged CSA of the intact muscle after several months
of training. Typically, Type II fibers manifest greater
increases in size than Type I fibers; thus the magnitude

Training Programs

of hypertrophy is not uniform between the two major
fiber types (83). In fact, it has been argued that the ultimate potential for hypertrophy may reside in the relative
proportion of Type II fibers within a given athlete’s
muscles (131, 191). That is, athletes who genetically
possess a relatively large proportion offast-twitch fibers
may have a greater potential for increasing muscle mass
than individuals possessing predominately slow-twitch
fibers.

Fiber Type Transitions
The pattern of neural stimulation dictates the extent to
which fiber type adaptations occur following anaerobic
training. Muscle fibers are theoretically positioned on a
continuum from the least oxidative to the most oxidative
type (see figure 5.3 and the description of muscle fiber
types in chapter 1). The continuum is as follows: IIx,
Hax, Ila, Hac, He, Ic, and I, with a concomitant myosin
heavy chain (MHC) expression (i.e., MHC IIx, Ila, and 1)
(181). Although the proportions of Type I and Ix fibers
are genetically determined (154), changes within each
subtype can occur following anaerobic training. With
training and activation of the high-threshold motor units,
there is a transition from Type IIx to Ha fiber type (25). In
other words, Type IIx muscle fibers change their myosin

adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) isoform content and
progressively become more oxidative IJa fibers. In fact,
research has shown nearly full transitions from Type IIx
to Ila fiber profiles following the combination of high-intensity resistance and aerobic endurance training (112).
The changes in fast-twitch fiber types have typically not
been linked to the rate at which changes in the muscle
fiber CSA take place.
Type IIx fibers represent a “reservoir” that, upon
consistent activation, changes into a more oxidative form
along the continuum (i1.e., to an intermediate fiber Type
Jax and then to a Ila) (25). Any change in the muscle
fiber type continuum and associated MHCs occurs in
the early stages of a resistance training program. In an
early study, Staron and colleagues (183) examined the

FIGURE 5.3 Muscle fiber transitions occur during
training. This means that a shift of the type of myosin
adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and heavy chains
takes place during training. Transformations from IIx
to llax to Ila can be seen, and then small percentages
change to llac and llc. Exercise activities that recruit
motor units with Type IIx muscle fibers initiate a shift
toward lla fibers.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

effects of a high-intensity resistance training protocol
(multiple sets of squat, leg press, and knee extension
exercises using 6- to 12RM loads and 2-minute rest
periods) performed by men and women two times
per week for eight weeks. They reported a significant
decrease in the Type IIx percentage in women after just
two weeks of training (four workouts) and in the men
after four weeks of training (eight workouts). Over
the eight-week training program, Type IIx fiber types
decreased from ~18% to about 7% of the total muscle
fibers in both men and women. Analysis of the MHCs
showed that in this early phase of training, IIx MHCs
were replaced with Ila MHCs. In addition, this study
demonstrated that changes in hormonal factors (testosterone and cortisol interactions) correlated with changes
in muscle fiber type. Interestingly, detraining has the
opposite effect, resulting in an increase in Type IIx fibers
and a reduction in Type IIa fibers (153), with a possible
overshoot of Type IIx fibers (i.e., higher IIx percentages
than observed pretraining ({10]). While transformation
within muscle fiber subtypes appears typical, transformation from Type I to Type II or vice versa appears less
probable, most likely due to differing MHC isoforms
and relative oxidative enzyme content (155). Whether
these transformations are possible remains doubtful at
this point, as insufficient evidence is currently available. These possibilities need to be explored in future
studies; it is intriguing to consider whether or not the
continuum of adaptations extends beyond Type I and II
subpopulations, especially in extreme cases in which
a marathon runner (high percentage of Type I fibers)
follows a high-intensity resistance training program or
a powerlifter (high percentage of Type II fibers) begins
an extensive aerobic endurance training program.

Structural and Architectural Changes
Pennate muscle has fascicles that attach obliquely (in a
slanted position) to its tendon. Pennation angle affects
the force production capabilities as well as the range of
motion of a muscle. Larger pennation angles can also
accommodate greater protein deposition and allow for
greater increases in CSA (2). In pennate muscle, resistance training has been shown to increase the angle of
pennation, with strength-trained athletes displaying
larger pennation angles in the triceps brachii and vastus
lateralis muscles compared to untrained individuals (2).
In addition, fascicle length has been shown to be greater
in strength-trained athletes (94), and fascicle length of
the gastrocnemius and vastus lateralis has been found
to be greater in sprinters compared to distance runners
(6). The combination of resistance, sprint, and jump
training has been shown to increase rectus femoris
fascicle length; and sprint and jump training have been
shown to increase vastus lateralis fascicle length (20).

These architectural changes have a positive effect on
the manner in which force is ultimately transmitted to
tendons and bones.

Other Muscular Adaptations

:

Resistance training has been shown to increase myofibrillar volume (128), cytoplasmic density (132),
sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-tubule density (9),
and sodium—potassium ATPase activity (71). Collectively, these changes act to facilitate hypertrophy and
enable greater expression of muscular strength. Sprint
training has been shown to enhance calcium release
(150), which assists in increasing speed and power
production by promoting actin and myosin crossbridge
formation.
Heavy resistance training has also been shown to
reduce mitochondrial density (133). While the number
of mitochondria actually remains constant or can
slightly increase throughout a training phase, mitochondrial density is expressed relative to muscle area.
Increases in muscle CSA occur disproportionately to
mitochondrial proliferation, and consequently the density of mitochondria per unit volume is actually found
to decrease with hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy
also results in decreased capillary density by similar
mechanisms, again with the number of capillaries per
fiber actually increasing somewhat (184). Powerlifters
and weightlifters show significantly lower capillary
densities than control subjects, whereas bodybuilders
have capillary densities similar to those of nonathletes
(107). Bodybuilding workouts produce large hydrogen
ion concentrations, but having more capillaries per fiber
may assist in the clearance of metabolites from exercising muscle (111, 190).
Anaerobic exercise results in substantial reductions
in muscle and blood pH (33), with several mechanisms
regulating a change in acid—base balance during exercise. With adaptations to consistent acute changes in
pH during training (i.e., increased H* concentration),
buffering capacity can improve. This increased capacity
then allows an athlete to better tolerate the accumulation
of H® within the working muscle, resulting in delayed
fatigue and greater muscular endurance (175). By its
nature, high-intensity interval training (sprints, cycling)
performed above the lactate threshold has been shown to
significantly increase buffering capacity by 16% to 38%
(17, 175). Elsewhere, athletes competing in anaerobic
team sports have been shown to have higher buffering
capacity than endurance athletes and untrained control
subjects (47).
Within skeletal muscle, substrate content and
enzyme activity represent further areas of adaptation
in response to anaerobic training. Most notably, when
ATP and creatine phosphate (CP) concentrations are


Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Programs

repeatedly exhausted following bouts of intermittent
high-intensity muscular contraction, the storage capacity of these high-energy compounds is increased via a
“supercompensation” effect. MacDougall and colleagues
(135) reported a 28% increase in resting CP and an 18%
increase in ATP concentrations following five months
of resistance training (i.e., three to five sets of 8-10
repetitions with 2-minute rest periods). In addition, it
appears that bodybuilding-style programs such as this,
which stress anaerobic glycolysis, may also be a potent
stimulus for enhancement of glycogen content, as this
was found to increase up to 112%.

mechanical loading, osteoblasts migrate to the bone
surface and begin bone modeling (figure 5.4). Osteoblasts manufacture and secrete proteins—primarily
collagen molecules—that are deposited in the spaces
between bone cells to increase strength. These proteins
form the bone matrix and eventually become mineralized as calcium phosphate crystals (hydroxyapatite).
New bone formation occurs predominantly on the outer
surface of the bone (periosteum), increasing diameter
and strength.

General Bone Physiology
The rate of bone adaptation occurs differently in the axial

Connective Tissue Adaptations
Bone, tendons, ligaments, fascia, and cartilage are exam-

ples of connective tissue. Anaerobic exercise imparts
mechanical forces that cause deformation of specific
regions of the skeleton. These forces, created by muscular actions on the tendinous insertion into bone, can

be bending, compressive, or torsional. In response to

bone, with the two types of bone linked by interlocking narrow and delicate plates of trabecular bone. The

Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

spaces between the trabecular plates are occupied by
bone marrow that consists of adipose tissue and blood
products such as immature red blood cells. Blood vessels
from the marrow cavity extend into the dense cortical
bone through a network of vertical and horizontal
canals. Because it is less dense and has a greater surface
area—to—mass ratio, trabecular bone is able to respond
more rapidly to stimuli than cortical bone as it is softer,
weaker, and more flexible and therefore more inclined

to adaptive change.
The term minimal essential strain (MES) refers to
the threshold stimulus that initiates new bone formation.
Consistently exceeding these thresholds signals osteoblasts to migrate to the region experiencing the stress
and to form bone, while forces that fall below the MES

do not present an appropriate stimulus for new bone
formation. Bone cells work to regulate the formation of
new bone tissue such that forces experienced on a regular basis do not exceed the MES, thereby establishing
a margin of safety against fracture. Strain registered
by bone is a function of the force per unit area of bone
(stress). The MES is thought to be approximately 1/10
of the force required to fracture bone. Increasing the
diameter of bone allows the force to be distributed over
a larger surface area, thereby decreasing the amount of
mechanical stress. Following bone growth, a force that
previously exceeded the MES will now be below the
MES threshold. Progressive weight-bearing physical
activities that generate forces exceeding the MES are
therefore the most effective at increasing bone size and
strength.
Forces that reach or exceed a threshold stimulus initiate new bone formation in the area

experiencing the mechanical strain.

Anaerobic Training and Bone Growth
As muscular strength and hypertrophy increase in
response to anaerobic training modalities, the forces
generated by the increased muscle contractions subsequently increase the mechanical stress on bone, and the
bone itself must increase in mass and strength to provide
an adequate support structure. Any increase in muscle
strength or mass may therefore result in a corresponding increase in bone mineral density (BMD), or the
quantity of mineral deposited in a given area of the bone
(93). Interestingly, inactivity or immobilization has the
opposite effect and results in a more rapid rate of loss
of bone matrix and BMD (178). Numerous studies have
shown a positive correlation between BMD and muscle
strength and mass (158, 198). Researchers have reported
that resistance-trained athletes have higher BMD than
age-matched sedentary control subjects (28, 29, 164).
In some individuals (e.g., professional soccer players),

physical activity seems to influence bone mass, area,
and width more than BMD (198). Thus, exercise that
stimulates muscle hypertrophy and strength gains also
appears to stimulate bone growth.
Quantitatively, the time course for bone adaptations is
rather long—approximately six months or longer (27)—
and depends intimately on the structure of the program.
However, the process of adaptation begins within the
first few workouts. The process of osteogenesis involves
secretion of substances into the blood (substances specific to bone only) that can be measured. Therefore, any
elevation in an osteogenic marker can be recognized as
an early indicator of bone formation and presumably a
precursor to increased BMD, provided that the stimulus
is maintained over a long training period.

Principles of Training
to Increase Bone Strength
Anaerobic training programs that have the objective to
stimulate bone growth need to incorporate specificity
of loading, speed and direction of loading, sufficient
volume, appropriate exercise selection, progressive
overload, and variation (30). Specificity of loading
demands the use of exercises that directly load the particular region of interest of the skeleton. If the body interprets these forces as new or novel, they will stimulate
bone growth in the area that is receiving the strain. For
example, running may be a good stimulus for increased
BMD in the femur but the wrong choice for promoting
mineral deposits when one is trying to strengthen the
wrist. The concept of specificity of loading becomes
particularly important when a strength and conditioning
professional prescribes exercises to increase bone mass
in regions of the skeleton most commonly affected
by osteoporosis—a disease in which BMD and bone
mass become reduced to critically low levels. Research
indicates that high-impact cyclical loading exercises for
the lower body, such as gymnastics (187), volleyball, or
basketball (42), selectively increase BMD at clinically
relevant sites such as the hip and spine more than lower-impact activities do. Additionally, increases in BMD
may be seen in highly trained college athletes already
possessing high levels of BMD. These changes in BMD
are independent of reproductive hormonal status if the
stimulus is sufficient (187).
Exercise selection is critical when one is trying to
elicit maximal osteogenic stimuli (factors that stimulate new bone formation). In essence, exercises should
involve multiple joints, should direct the force vectors
primarily through the spine and hip (i.e., structural
exercises), and should apply external loads heavier than
those with single-joint assistance exercises. Cussler and
colleagues (35) showed a positive linear relationship
between the amounts of weight lifted over the course


Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Programs

of a training year and associated increases in BMD.
In addition, the findings of this research highlighted
the importance of exercise specificity in that the squat,
compared to seated leg press, was more effective for
increasing BMD in the trochanter of the femur (35). The
use of single-joint, machine-based exercises should be
limited, as these exercises isolate a single muscle group
by using equipment as support to stabilize the body rather
than promoting skeletal support. Therefore, exercises
such as the back squat, power clean, deadlift, snatch,
and push jerk (for the axial skeleton and lower body)
and the shoulder press (for the upper body) are recommended as more effective methods for increasing bone
strength.
Because bone responds favorably to mechanical
forces, the principle of progressive overload—progressively placing greater than normal demands on the
exercising musculature—applies when one is training
to increase bone mass (70, 196). Although the maximal
strength of bone is maintained well above the voluntary
force capabilities of the associated musculature, bone
responds to higher forces (e.g., 1- to 1ORM loads) that
are repetitively applied over time. The adaptive response
of bone ensures that forces do not exceed a critical level
that increases the risk of stress fractures (microfractures
in bone due to structural fatigue). Support for progressive
overload comes from studies that have compared BMD
of various groups of athletes to that of nonathletes (42,
198). In fact, elite adolescent weightlifters have been
found to possess levels of bone mineralization that far
exceed values found in untrained adults (29, 91). This
observation is interesting because it indicates that young
bone may be more responsive to osteogenic stimuli than
mature bone. Evidence indicates that physical activity
during growth modulates the external geometry and
trabecular architecture of bone, potentially enhancing
skeletal strength (84). Recent evidence shows that
physical activity—associated bone loading during skel-

etal growth (i.e., adolescence) and after skeletal growth
(1.e., early adulthood) elevates peak bone mass and is

positively associated with adult bone mass in later life
(186).
Another important consideration in the design of
programs to stimulate new bone formation is training
variation. The internal architecture of the human skeleton has a mechanism through which it compensates
for new strain patterns experienced by the bone. To
optimally dissipate the imposed forces, the direction of
the collagen fibers within the bone matrix may change
to conform to the lines of stress experienced by the bone.
Thus, changing the distribution (and direction) of the
force vectors by using a variety of exercises continually presents a unique stimulus for new bone formation
within a given region of bone. Subsequently, collagen
formation occurs in multiple directions, increasing bone
strength in various directions. Overall, if the magnitude
of the load or the rate of force application is sufficient,
it is not typically necessary to perform more than a total
of 30 to 35 repetitions, as a greater volume of loading
is not likely to provide any additional stimulus for bone
growth (57, 178).
The components of mechanical load that
stimulate bone growth are the magnitude of

the load (intensity), rate (speed) of loading,
direction of the forces, and the volume of
loading (number of repetitions).

Adaptations of Tendons, Ligaments,
and Fascia to Anaerobic Training
Tendons, ligaments, fascia, and cartilage are complex

and dynamic structures that are the critical link between
muscles and bones. The primary structural component
of all connective tissue is the collagen fiber (Type I for
bone, tendon, and ligaments and Type II for cartilage;

How Can Athletes Stimulate Bone Formation?
In order to promote bone formation, athletes should use specific programming of acute training variables in
order to maximize optimal adaptations.

e

Select multijoint, structural exercises that involve many muscle groups at once. Avoid isolated, single-joint
movements.

e

Select exercises that direct axial force vectors through the spine and hip and apply heavier loads than
single-joint assistance exercises.

e

Use the principle of progressive overload to stress the musculoskeletal system, and continue to progressively increase load as the tissues become accustomed to the stimulus.

e

Use both heavy-load exercises and ballistic or high-impact exercises to expose the bone to different
intensities of force.

e

By varying exercise selection, it is possible to change the distribution of force insults and present a
unique stimulus for new bone formation.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

are arranged in sheets with the layers oriented in different

figure 5.5). The parent protein, procollagen, is synthesized and secreted by fibroblasts, which are the most
common cells found in the connective tissue of animals
and act as stem cells in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, as well as playing a critical role in wound
healing. Procollagen molecules consist of three protein
strands twisted around each other in a triple helix. Procollagen leaves the cell with protective extensions on the
ends to prevent premature collagen formation. Cleavage
of the extensions via enzymes results in the formation
of active collagen that aligns with other collagen molecules to form a long filament. Measurement of these
enzymes provides an indication of collagen metabolism.
In fact, enzyme levels increase in response to training,
thereby showing increased net Type I collagen synthesis
(125). The parallel arrangement of filaments is called a
microfibril. Collagen has a striated (striped) appearance

directions, as found in bone, cartilage, and fascia.

Tendons and ligaments are composed primarily of
tightly packed, parallel arrangements of collagen bundies. Mature tendons and ligaments contain relatively
few cells. The small number of metabolically active
cells in tendons and ligaments makes the requirement
for oxygen and nutrients in these tissues relatively low.
Ligaments contain elastic fibers (elastin) in addition to
collagen, as a certain amount of stretch is needed within
a ligament to allow normal joint motion. Tendons and
ligaments attach to bone with great strength, allowing the
maximal transmission of forces. The fibrous connective
tissues that surround and separate the different organizational levels within skeletal muscle are referred to as
fascia. Fascia has sheets of fibrocollagenous support
tissue, containing bundles of collagen fibers arranged
in different planes, to provide resistance to forces from
different directions. Fascia within muscles converges
near the end of the muscle to form a tendon through
which the force of muscle contraction is transmitted
to bone. Compared with that of muscle tissue, tendon
metabolism is much slower due to poorer vascularity
and circulation (92). In fact, the increase in blood flow
to skeletal muscle via exercise is not paralleled by
the same flow perfusion in tendons (99). This limited

under a light microscope, somewhat like skeletal muscle,

owing to the orderly alignment of the gaps between the
collagen molecules within a microfibril. As bone grows,
microfibrils become arranged into fibers, and the fibers
into larger bundles. The true strength of collagen comes
from the strong chemical bonds (cross-linking) that
form between adjacent collagen molecules throughout
the collagen bundles. Collagen bundles are bunched
together longitudinally to form tendons or ligaments, or

vascularity has implications for regeneration and is the
reason tendons can take significant amounts of time to

heal following injury.
The primary stimulus for growth of tendons, ligaments, and fascia is the insult from mechanical forces

created during high-intensity exercise. The degree of
tissue adaptation appears to be proportional to the intensity of exercise (99). Consistent anaerobic exercise that
exceeds the threshold of strain has a positive effect on
stimulating connective tissue changes (92).
Empirical evidence suggests that connective tissues
must increase their functional capabilities in response
to increased muscle strength and hypertrophy. The sites
where connective tissues can increase strength and
load-bearing capacity are
* the junctions between the tendon (and ligament)
and bone surface,

¢ within the body of the tendon or ligament, and
¢ in the network of fascia within skeletal muscle
(99).

As muscles become stronger, they pull on their bony
attachments with greater force and cause an increase in
bone mass at the tendon—bone junction and along the
line over which the forces are distributed.
High-intensity anaerobic training results in connective tissue growth and other ultrastructural changes that
enhance force transmission. Specific changes within a
tendon that contribute to its increase in size and strength
include the following:
¢ An increase in collagen fibril diameter
¢ A greater number of covalent cross-links within
the hypertrophied fiber
¢ An increase in the number of collagen fibrils

¢ An increase in the packing density of collagen
fibrils
Collectively, these adaptations increase the tendon’s
ability to withstand greater tensional forces (143).
Muscle hypertrophy in animals relates to an increase
in the number and size of fibroblasts, thereby resulting
in a greater supply oftotal collagen. Activation of fibroblasts and subsequent growth of the connective tissue
network are prerequisites for hypertrophy of active
muscle (142). This may explain why biopsies oftrained
athletes have shown that hypertrophied muscle contains
greater total collagen than in untrained individuals but
that the collagen content remains proportional to the
existing muscle mass (143). Recent studies indicate
that tendon stiffness (force transmission per unit of
strain, or tendon elongation) increases as a result of
resistance training (123). In fact, Kubo and colleagues
(121) reported a 15% to 19% increase in Achilles tendon
stiffness following eight weeks of resistance training.
The intensity of exercise is critical, as heavy loads (80%
of 1RM) increase tendon stiffness but light loads (20%
of 1RM) do not (122).

Adaptations of Cartilage
to Anaerobic Training
Cartilage is a dense connective tissue capable of withstanding considerable force without damage to its structure. The main functions of cartilage are to
* provide a smooth joint articulating surface,

* actasa shock absorber for forces directed through
the joint, and
¢ aid in the attachment of connective tissue to the
skeleton.

How Can Athletes Stimulate Connective Tissue Adaptations?
Tendons, Ligaments, Fascia
e
e

Long-term adaptations in tendons, ligaments, and fascia are stimulated through progressive high-intensity
loading patterns using external resistances.
High-intensity loads should be used, as low to moderate intensities do not markedly change the collagen
content of connective tissue.

e

Forces should be exerted throughout the full range of motion of a joint, and wherever possible multiple-joint exercises should be used.

Cartilage
e

Moderate-intensity anaerobic exercise seems to be adequate for increasing cartilage thickness. Strenuous exercise does not appear to cause any degenerative joint disease when progressively overloaded
appropriately.

e

Tissue viability can be maintained by adopting a variety of exercise modalities and ensuring that load is
applied throughout the range of motion.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

A feature unique to cartilage is that it lacks its own
blood supply and must depend on diffusion of oxygen
and nutrients from synovial fluid (which is why cartilage does not easily repair itself following injury). Two
primary types of cartilage are significant in relation to
physical activity. Hyaline cartilage (articular cartilage)
is found on the articulating surfaces of bones. Fibrous
cartilage is a very tough form of cartilage found in the
intervertebral disks of the spine and at the junctions
where tendons attach to bone.
The fact that articular cartilage gets its nutrient
supply via diffusion from synovial fluid provides a
link for joint mobility to joint health. Movement about
a joint creates changes in pressure in the joint capsule
that drive nutrients from the synovial fluid toward the
articular cartilage of the joint (180). Immobilization of
a joint prevents proper diffusion of oxygen and essential
nutrients throughout the joint. This results in the death of
the healthy cells within cartilage, called chondrocytes,
and a resorption of the cartilage matrix (195). Current
understanding indicates that human cartilage undergoes
atrophy, or thinning, when external loading is removed
(e.g., postoperative immobilization and paraplegia).
However, the effect that increased external loading
has on average cartilage thickness remains to be fully
elucidated (46). In any case, it is likely that genetic
contribution plays a greater role in determining cartilage
morphology.

Endocrine Responses
and Adaptations to
Anaerobic Training
Hormones have a variety of regulatory roles during
anaerobic training and affect homeostatic mechanisms
dedicated to keeping the body’s functions within normal
range during rest and exercise (60, 61, 102, 106, 109).
These include the development of muscle, bone, and

connective tissue through both anabolic and catabolic processes. As discussed in chapter 4, endocrine
responses to anaerobic training can include (a) acute
changes during and after exercise, (b) chronic changes
in the acute response to a workout, (c) chronic changes
in resting concentrations, and (d) changes in hormone
receptor content.

Acute Anabolic Hormone Responses
Following anaerobic exercise (in particular resistance
training), elevated concentrations of testosterone,
molecular variants of growth hormone, and cortisol

have been found for up to 30 minutes in men (104,
105, 115, 117). These fluctuations occur quickly and

then rapidly stabilize in response to homeostatic chal-

lenges from the initial demands of acute exercise (119,
183) and longer-term training (136). The magnitude of
elevation is greatest when large muscle mass exercises
are performed, or during workouts with moderate to
high intensity and volume combined with ‘shorter rest
intervals (111, 115) For example, high correlations exist
between blood lactate (i.e., from high-intensity anaerobic
exercise), growth hormone, and cortisol (78), and thus

it is thought that hydrogen ion accumulation may be a
primary factor influencing growth hormone and cortisol
release. Elsewhere, elevations in free testosterone have

been shown to be greater in resistance-trained men
compared to aerobic-trained men (82, 193), with some

studies reporting slight testosterone elevations in women
following anaerobic exercise (149).
The acute anabolic hormone response to
anaerobic exercise is critical for exercise
performance and subsequent training adaptations. Upregulation of anabolic hormone
receptors is important for mediating the
hormonal effects.

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a primary mediator of growth hormone; it acts as a hormonal messenger
that stimulates growth-promoting effects in almost every
cell of the body, especially skeletal muscle, cartilage, and
bone. Insulin-like growth factor I has a delayed response
to exercise and is dependent upon the acute growth hormone response. However, alternative mechano growth
factors are upregulated in skeletal muscle in response
to mechanical loading and act independently of growth
hormone (66). Insulin secretion in comparison parallels
blood glucose and amino acid changes, with insulin
mostly affected by supplementation before, during, or
after exercise and not by the anaerobic exercise stimulus
(13). Catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine,
dopamine) reflect the acute demands of anaerobic
exercise (22, 56, 105, 111), with increasing concentrations important for regulating force production, muscle
contraction rate, energy availability, and augmentation
of other hormones (e.g., testosterone).

Chronic Changes in
the Acute Hormonal Response
Adherence to a long-term resistance training program
results in an increased ability to exert greater levels of
muscular force (80), with relative training intensities
increasing over time as the body adapts to tolerate progressively heavier loads. As a consequence, acute endocrine responses to anaerobic training will likely mirror
these improvements, as has been predominantly shown
with growth hormone (34). The longitudinal changes in
endocrine function reflect the increased exercise “stress”


Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Programs

being tolerated by the body in response to incremental
external loading. It is thus hypothesized that any chronic
adaptations in acute hormonal response patterns potentially augment the ability to better tolerate and sustain
prolonged higher exercise intensities.

Chronic Changes in Resting
Hormonal Concentrations
Chronic changes in resting hormone concentrations
following anaerobic exercise are unlikely, with research
providing inconclusive changes in testosterone, growth
hormone, IGF-I, and cortisol over time (115). Instead,
resting concentrations likely reflect the current state
of the muscle tissue in response to substantial changes
to the training program (i.e., volume or intensity) and

nutritional factors. It appears that the elevation during
and immediately following a workout may present
receptors with enough of a stimulus to affect tissue
remodeling without the need for chronic elevations
in basal concentrations (162). It is important to note
that chronic elevations in an anabolic hormone may be
counterproductive over the long term. Receptors tend
to downregulate over time when exposed consistently
to high levels of hormones. For example, in type 2 diabetes mellitus, sensitivity of skeletal muscle to insulin
is reduced due to chronic elevated blood insulin. This
is why anabolic steroid users repeatedly cycle drug use
rather than maintaining consistently high doses.

Hormone Receptor Changes
Receptor content is important for mediating the adaptations elicited by any hormonal response. Androgen
receptors (AR) have received much attention in the
literature, and their content (i.e., number of receptors
per area on the target tissue) depends on several factors

including muscle fiber type, contractile activity, and the
concentrations of testosterone. Resistance training has
been shown to upregulate AR content within 48 to 72
hours after the workout (15). The resistance exercise
stimulus appears to mediate the magnitude of acute AR
modifications. Ratamess and colleagues (162) compared
one set versus six sets of 10 repetitions of squats and
reported no differences in AR content following the
single-set protocol; however, the higher-volume protocol
elicited significant downregulation of AR content | hour
after the workout. This study also demonstrated that
when sufficient volume is reached, AR protein content
may initially downregulate, before the upregulation that
has been shown in other studies. However, Kraemer

and colleagues (118) have shown that consumption of
a protein-carbohydrate supplement before and after the
workout attenuates this AR downregulation.

Cardiovascular and Respiratory
Responses to Anaerobic Exercise
Both acute bouts of anaerobic exercise and long-term
anaerobic training have a significant impact on cardiovascular and respiratory function. This is reflected in
both anaerobic athletes (51) and sedentary individuals
(97), where enhanced cardiac function and dimensions
are apparent. Heavy-load resistance training can benefit
the cardiovascular system, but differently from resistance
training with more repetitions of light loads and less
rest or conventional aerobic endurance training (52).
Improved ability of the heart, lungs, and circulatory
system to function under conditions of high pressure
and force production can prepare the athlete’s body for
the extreme demands of sporting competition.

Acute Cardiovascular Responses
to Anaerobic Exercise
An acute bout of anaerobic exercise significantly
increases cardiovascular responses. Heart rate, stroke
volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure all increase
significantly during resistance exercise. Peak blood pressures of 320/250 mmHg and a heart rate of 170 beats/
min have been reported during a high-intensity (..e.,
95% of 1RM) leg press exercise (134). Generally, the
blood pressure response increases nonlinearly with the
magnitude of active muscle mass and is higher during
the concentric phase of each repetition than during the
eccentric phase, especially at the “sticking point” of an
exercise. Although large elevations in blood pressure
have been reported, there are limited data to indicate that
resistance training has any negative effects on resting
blood pressure (31). In addition, intrathoracic pressure
increases, and plasma volume reductions of up to 22%
have been reported (157, 162).
Acute anaerobic exercise results in increased

cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate,
oxygen uptake, systolic blood pressure, and
blood flow to active muscles.

During a set of resistance exercise, stroke volume
and cardiac output increase mostly during the eccentric
phase of each repetition, especially when the Valsalva
technique is used (see chapter 2) (49). Because the concentric phase of a repetition is much more difficult and
elevations in intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures
are more prominent (via the Valsalva maneuver), limiting venous return and reducing end-diastolic volume,
the hemodynamic response of resistance exercise is
delayed such that cardiac output increases more during




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

the eccentric phase or during the rest period between
sets. This is especially true for an individual’s heart rate
response; during the first 5 seconds after completion of
a set, heart rate is higher than during the set itself (160).
The degree to which blood flow is increased in the
working muscles during anaerobic training is dependent
on a number of factors, including (a) the intensity of
resistance, (b) the length of time of the effort (i.e., the
number of repetitions performed), and (c) the size of
the muscle mass activated. When lower resistances are
lifted for many repetitions, the responses are relatively
similar to those observed during aerobic exercise (64).
However, heavy resistance exercise decreases blood
flow to the working muscles as a result of contracted
muscle tissue’s clamping down on capillaries and creating a localized occlusion. Muscular contractions greater
than 20% of maximal voluntary contraction impede
peripheral blood flow within the muscle during a set, but
blood flow increases during the subsequent rest period
(reactive hyperemia) (116). Interestingly, the lack of
blood flow (and subsequent increase in metabolites such
as hydrogen ions and reduction in pH) during heavy
external loading is a potent stimulus for muscle growth
(188). Overall, the magnitude of the acute cardiovascular responses depends on the intensity and volume of
exercise, muscle mass involvement, rest period length,
and contraction velocity (113, 160).

Chronic Cardiovascular

Adaptations at Rest
The effect of anaerobic training modalities on resting
heart rate remains to be fully elucidated. Short-term
resistance training has been shown to decrease resting
heart rate between 5% and 12% (53, 57). However, when
this effect is studied longitudinally over time, mixed
responses are reported, with either no change in resting
heart rate or reductions of 4% to 13% (53, 57). In chronically resistance-trained athletes (e.g., bodybuilders,
powerlifters, weightlifters), both average and lower than
average resting heart rates (60-78 beats/min) have been
reported compared to those in untrained individuals.
A meta-analysis of resting blood pressure indicated
that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased
by 2% to 4% as an adaptation to resistance training (95).
It appears that the response is greatest in those individuals who initially have a slightly elevated blood pressure.
Similarly, the rate—pressure product (heart rate X
systolic blood pressure; a measure of myocardial work)
has been shown to either remain constant or decrease
following resistance training (52, 53). Stroke volume
has been shown to increase in absolute magnitude, but
not relative to body surface area or lean body mass (53).
That is, stroke volume will increase as lean tissue mass

increases during long-term resistance training. Lastly,
resistance training may either not change or slightly
decrease total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins
and increase high-density lipoproteins (90). Therefore,
heavy resistance training does little to enhance resting .
cardiac function, but greater improvements may result
from adaptations to a high-volume program with short
rest periods (i.e., bodybuilding, circuit training) in which
the overall continuity of the exercise stress in a workout
is much higher.
Chronic resistance training also alters cardiac dimensions. Increased left ventricular wall thickness and
mass have been reported, but the increase disappears
when expressed relative to body surface area or lean
body mass (52, 53). It is thought that this increase may
result from exposure to intermittently elevated blood
pressures and increases in intrathoracic pressure in
addition to accommodating changes from increases in
lean body mass and body size. Highly resistance-trained
athletes have greater than normal absolute posterior left
ventricular and intraventricular septum wall thickness
(55). Little or no change in left ventricular chamber
size or volume is observed with resistance training; this
is a major difference between resistance exercise and
aerobic exercise. Greater than normal absolute left and
right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes
have been reported in bodybuilders but not weightlifters
(55), which indicates that high-volume training may be
more conducive to increasing absolute left ventricular
volumes. It is important to note that bodybuilders frequently incorporate aerobic exercise into their training
programs in an effort to metabolize body fat and promote
a lean body composition; therefore, it is possible that
some of these adaptations have been brought about, in
part, by aerobic endurance training. Bodybuilders as well
as weightlifters have greater than normal absolute and
relative (to lean body mass and body surface) left atrial
internal dimensions, with the bodybuilders showing a
significantly greater dimension (37).

Chronic Adaptations of
the Acute Cardiovascular
Response to Anaerobic Exercise
Chronic resistance training reduces the cardiovascular
response to an acute bout of resistance exercise of a given
absolute intensity or workload. Short-term studies have
shown that resistance training results in adaptations that
blunt the acute increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and
double product caused by the resistance training workout
(139, 169). In addition, male bodybuilders have been

found to have lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rates during sets of 50% to 100% of IRM
performed to momentary muscular failure compared to


Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Programs

both sedentary and lesser-trained men (54). Interestingly,
bodybuilders’ peak cardiac output and stroke volume
are significantly greater than those of powerlifters (49),
demonstrating that stroke volume and cardiac output
may be greater per absolute workload as a result of
training. It is thought that these adaptations result from
a decreased afterload on the left ventricle, which in
turn increases cardiac output and decreases myocardial
oxygen consumption (49). Lastly, oxygen extraction is
generally not improved with resistance training using
heavy loads and low volume. It is enhanced to a greater
extent with continuous aerobic exercise or perhaps
slightly with a resistance training program using high
volume and short rest periods (116).

Ventilatory Response
to Anaerobic Exercise
Ventilation rate generally does not limit resistance
exercise and is either unaffected or only moderately
improved by anaerobic training. With resistance exercise, ventilation is significantly elevated during each
set, but the elevation is even greater during the first
minute of recovery (160). Ventilations in excess of 60
L/min have been reported (160), and the rest interval
length had a large effect such that short rest intervals
(30 seconds to 1 minute) produced the most substantial
elevation. Training adaptations include increased tidal
volume and breathing frequency with maximal exercise.
With submaximal activity, however, breathing frequency
is often reduced while tidal volume is increased. It
appears that such ventilatory adaptations result from
local, neural, or chemical adaptations in the specific
muscles trained through exercise (14). Additionally,
improved ventilation efficiency, as characterized by
reduced ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (the ratio

of air ventilated to oxygen used by the tissues, V./VO,),
is observed in trained versus untrained individuals (14).

Compatibility of Aerobic
and Anaerobic Modes of Training
Strength/power training and work capacity—endurance
training have divergent physiology that presents a programming challenge to the strength and conditioning
professional working to optimize concurrent gains in
both these physical and physiological characteristics.
Combining resistance and aerobic endurance training
may interfere with strength and power gains, primarily
if the aerobic endurance training is high in intensity,
volume, or frequency (44, 86, 112). Callister and colleagues (24) showed that simultaneous sprint and aerobic
endurance training decreased sprint speed and jump
power. Possible explanations for this less-than-optimal

power development include adverse neural changes and
the alterations of muscle proteins in muscle fibers. In
contrast, most studies have shown no adverse effects on
aerobic power resulting from heavy resistance exercise
despite the expected cellular changes caused by this type
of exercise (112). Few studies have shown that resistance training can hinder VO,max improvements (65).

Interestingly, Kraemer and colleagues (120) reported
that women who performed both resistance exercise and
aerobic endurance training had greater aerobic development than those who performed the aerobic endurance
training alone. Such data have encouraged some athletes
(e.g., distance runners) to add supplemental sport-specific resistance training to their total training regimen.
Indeed, the majority of research indicates that heavy
resistance training has very limited, if any, negative
effects on aerobic power (197) but instead can serve to
actually enhance performance in endurance sports (172).
In a study examining the potential incompatibility of strength and endurance exercise, Kraemer and
colleagues (112) used three months of simultaneous
high-intensity strength and aerobic endurance training
under five conditions:

1. A combination group (C) that performed both
resistance and aerobic endurance training

2. A group (UC) that performed upper body resistance and aerobic endurance training
3. A resistance training—only group (S)
4. An aerobic endurance training—only group (E)
5. Acontrol group

The S group increased IRM strength and rate of strength
development more than did the C group. In addition,
maximal oxygen consumption improvements were not
affected by the simultaneous training (i.e., almost identical improvements in 2-mile [3.2 km] run times). Thus,
no overtraining state for aerobic endurance was apparent.
A tascinating finding of the research by Kraemer and
colleagues (112) was change in the muscle fiber size
of the thigh musculature. Previous studies have shown
decreases in muscle fiber size during aerobic endurance
training (15, 65). Kraemer’s group (112), however,
indicated that the transformation of Type IIx to Type Ila
fibers was almost complete in the S group (19.1£7.9%
Type IIx pretraining to 1.9+0.8% posttraining) and C
group (14.11+7.2% pre to 1.6+0.8% post). Interestingly,
the UC and E groups (who performed only interval training) also had significant Type IIx fiber transformation
after training (22.6+4.9% pre to 11.6+5.3% post for
UC, and 19.2+3.6% pre to 8.8+4.4% post for E). This
indicates that heavy resistance training recruits more of
the Type IIx fibers than high-intensity aerobic endurance
interval training. In addition, a small number (<3%) of




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Type IIa fibers were converted to Type Ic fibers in the
aerobic training group. The combined group increased
muscle size only in Type Ila fibers, while the S group
demonstrated increases in Type I, IIc, and Ila fibers. The
lack of change in Type I fiber area and increase in Type
IIa fiber area in the C group appear to represent a cellular
adaptation that shows the antagonism of simultaneous
strength and aerobic endurance stimuli, since strength
training alone produced increases in both Type I and

II muscle fiber areas. The E group showed decreased
size in Type I and IIc fibers, presumably due to higher
observed cortisol levels (and reduced testosterone) and
their physiological need for shorter distances between
capillary and cell to enhance oxygen kinetics.
The majority of studies use untrained subjects to
examine the effects of simultaneous high-intensity
resistance training and aerobic endurance training (65,
74, 127, 138). Few studies have looked at concurrent

What Performance Improvements Occur Following Anaerobic Exercise?
Muscular Strength
e

A review of more than 100 studies has shown that mean strength can increase approximately 40%
in “untrained,” 20% in “moderately trained,” 16% in “trained,” 10% in “advanced,” and 2% in “elite”
participants over periods ranging from four weeks to two years (103).

e

With training, a positive shift in muscle fiber types reflects an augmented recruitment of higherorder
motor units. Type IIx fibers transition to Type Ila fibers and reflect a greater fatigue resistance at similar
absolute force output.

Power
e

The optimal load for maximizing absolute peak power output in the jump squat Is 0% of 1RM (i.e., body
weight [31]). However, it has been reported that peak power output is maximized in trained power athletes with higher loads corresponding to 30% to 60% of squat 1RM (12).

e

Peak power in the squat is maximized at 56% of 1RM and in the power clean at 80% of 1RM (31).

e

For the upper body, peak power output can be maximized during the ballistic bench press throw using
loads corresponding to 46% to 62% of 1RM bench press (11).

Local Muscular Endurance
e

Cross-sectional data in anaerobic athletes have shown enhanced muscular endurance and subsequent
muscular adaptations consistent with improved oxidative and buffering capacity (100).

e¢

Skeletal muscle adaptations to anaerobic muscular endurance training include fiber type transitions
from Type IIx to Type IIb, as well as increases in mitochondrial and capillary numbers, buffering capacity,
resistance to fatigue, and metabolic enzyme activity (64, 116).

Body Composition
e

Resistance training can increase fat-free mass and reduce body fat by up to 9% (116).

¢

Increases in lean tissue mass, daily metabolic rate, and energy expenditure during exercise are outcomes
of resistance training (53).

Flexibility
e

Anaerobic training potentially can have a positive impact on flexibility, and a combination of resistance
training and stretching appears to be the most effective method to improve flexibility with increasing
muscle mass (116).

Aerobic Capacity
e

In untrained people, heavy resistance training can increase VO,max from 5% to 8%. In trained individuals, resistance training does not significantly affect aerobic capacity (52).

¢

Circuit training and programs using high volume and short rest periods (i.e., 30 seconds or less) have

been shown to improve VO,max (64).

Motor Performance
e

Resistance training has been shown to increase running economy, vertical jump, sprint speed, tennis
serve velocity, swinging and throwing velocity, and kicking performance (116).


Adaptations to Anaerobic

training in elite athlete populations (172). Several studies have shown an incompatibility using three days a
week ofresistance training alternating with three days a
week ofaerobic endurance training (i.e., tiaining on six
consecutive days), or four to six days a week of combined high-intensity resistance and aerobic endurance
training (16, 44, 112), thereby lending credibility to the
suggestion that the onset of overtraining mechanisms

could have played a role. When both modalities are performed during the same workout (yielding a frequency
of three days a week with at least one day off between
workouts), the incompatibility has not been shown as
frequently (127, 137, 138). An exception was a study
by Sale and colleagues (168), who showed that training
four days (two days of resistance training and two days
of aerobic endurance training) per week was better than
training two days (combined resistance training and
aerobic endurance training) per week for increasing
leg press IRM (25% vs. 13%). These studies show that
increasing the recovery period between workouts may
decrease the incompatibility, a principle supported by a
recent meta-analysis of concurrent training by Wilson
and colleagues (197).
Power development appears to be negatively affected
more than strength during concurrent high-intensity
resistance and aerobic endurance training. Hakkinen and
colleagues (74) reported similar dynamic and isometric
strength increases following 21 weeks of concurrent
training or resistance training only; however, the resistance training—only group showed improvements in
the rate of force development whereas the concurrent
training group did not match this increase. Kraemer
and colleagues (112) also showed that a resistance
training—only group increased muscle power whereas a
combined group did not. The resistance training—only
group also increased peak power in upper and lower
body tests while the combined group did not. It appears
that power development is much more susceptible to the
antagonistic effects of combined strength and aerobic
endurance training than is slow-velocity strength (112).
Lastly, the sequence may play a role in the magnitude
of adaptation. Leveritt and Abernethy (126) examined
lifting performance 30 minutes following a 25-minute
aerobic exercise workout and found that the number of
repetitions performed during the squat was reduced by
13% to 36% over three sets.

Training Programs

inadequate recovery (140). When training frequency,
volume, or intensity (or some combination ofthese) is
excessive without sufficient rest, recovery, and nutri-

ent intake, conditions of extreme fatigue, illness, or
injury (or more than one ofthese) can occur (110, 124,

185). This accumulation of training stress can result in
long-term decrements in performance with or without
associated physiological and psychological signs and
symptoms of maladaptation, and is referred to as overtraining. Depending on the extent to which an athlete is
overtrained, restoration of performance can take several
weeks or months (81, 140).
When an athlete undertakes excessive training that
leads to short-term decrements in performance, this
temporary response has been termed overreaching or
functional overreaching (FOR) (58, 163). Recovery
from this condition is normally achieved within a few
days or weeks ofrest; consequently, overreaching can be
prescribed as a planned phase in many training programs.
The rationale is to overwork (to suppress performance
and build up tolerance) and then taper in order to allow
for a “supercompensation” in performance. In fact, it has
been shown that short-term overreaching followed by
an appropriate tapering period can result in beneficial
strength and power gains (163). When mismanaged,
however, it can lead to detrimental effects (144).
When the intensification of a training stimulus continues without adequate recovery and regeneration, an
athlete can evolve into a state of extreme overreaching,
or nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR). This NFOR
leads to stagnation and a decrease in performance that
will continue for several weeks or months. When an athlete does not fully respect the balance between training
and recovery, the first signs and symptoms of prolonged
training distress are decreased performance, increased
fatigue, decreased vigor, and hormonal disturbances.
When those occur, it becomes difficult to differentiate
between NFOR and what has been termed overtraining
syndrome (OTS). Central to the definition of OTS is a
“prolonged maladaptation” not only of the athlete, but
also of several biological, neurochemical, and hormonal
regulation mechanisms. Many alternative terms have
been suggested for OTS, including burnout, chronic
overwork, staleness, unexplained underperformance
syndrome, and overfatigue (21, 23). Figure 5.6 illustrates the progression that composes the overtraining

continuum.

Overtraining
The goal of training is to provide incremental overload
on the body so that physiological adaptations can subsequently contribute to improved performance. Successful
training must not only involve overload, but must also

avoid the combination of excessive overload with

Overtraining syndrome can last as long as six months
or beyond; and in the worst-case scenario, OTS

can

ruin an athletic career. Two distinct types of OTS have
been proposed: sympathetic and parasympathetic. The
sympathetic overtraining syndrome includes increased
sympathetic activity at rest, whereas the parasympathetic overtraining syndrome involves increased

parasympathetic activity at rest and with exercise (140).
The sympathetic syndrome is thought to develop before
the parasympathetic syndrome and predominates in
younger athletes who train for speed or power (58).
Eventually all states of overtraining culminate in the
parasympathetic syndrome and the chronic suppression
of most physiological systems throughout the body
(140). Because rebounds are possible, it is difficult to
determine exactly when overtraining becomes chronic.
In addition, some athletes respond positively to overreaching strategies (163) whereas for others, overreaching can be the catalyst for OTS.

TABLE 5.3

A predominant feature of OTS is the inability to
sustain high-intensity exercise when training load is
maintained or increased (141). In many cases OTS is
a consequence of prolonged NFOR, which in itself can
result from mistakes in the prescription of training load
and a mismanagement of the acute training variables
(e.g., intensity, volume, rest). A common mistake in
overtrained athletes is a rate of progressive overload
that is too high. That is, increasing either the volume or
intensity (or both) too rapidly over a period of several
weeks or months with insufficient recovery can result
in greater structural damage over time and, potentially,
overtraining. A theoretical overview of anaerobic overtraining is presented in table 5.3.
For the purpose of investigating overtraining, deliberately causing OTS is not easy in a laboratory setting.
What is more, while the symptoms of OTS are generally
thought of as more severe than those of NFOR, there is
no scientific evidence to confirm or refute this suggestion
(140), making it hard to confirm that OTS has occurred.
Instead, longitudinal monitoring of athletes has been the
most practical way of documenting the physiological
responses and performance effects of overtraining. The
majority of this research has been conducted in endurance-type sports, where it is perhaps more prevalent.
However, a survey of overtrained athletes showed that
77% were also involved in sports requiring high levels of
strength, speed, or coordination (58). The symptoms of
overtraining found in anaerobic activities (sympathetic)
were also different from those in aerobic—endurance
activities (parasympathetic) (23, 58).

Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Programs

Sympathetic-type overtraining is a little more difficult
to characterize than parasympathetic overtraining. It can
be speculated that increased neural activity consequent to
excessive motor unit activation may bring about this type
of overtraining; however, there are many other factors
that could potentially contribute. Adopting a short-term
NFOR model (eight sets of machine squats with a 95%
IRM load for six consecutive days), Fry and colleagues
(59) examined intensity-specific responses and reported
nonspecific performance decreases in isokinetic torque
production, longer sprint times, and longer agility
times. They did, however, find that IRM strength was
preserved. In a subsequent study by Fry and associates
(62), subjects performed 10 sets of RM over seven days
with a day’s rest. This resulted in a significant decrease

(9.9 pounds [4.5 kg]) in the IRM in 73% of the subjects. Interestingly, some subjects made progress and
did not reach a NFOR state. This demonstrates that the
time course for the onset of overreaching or overtraining
symptoms 1s greatly dependent on individual responses,
training status, and genetic endowment.

Mistakes That Can Lead
to Anaerobic Overtraining
The overtraining state is associated with damage to or
negative physiological alterations in the neuromuscular
system. As with any form of training, the structure of
an anaerobic training program ultimately dictates the
nature of the physical and physiological adaptations

What Are the Markers of Anaerobic Overtraining?
Although the knowledge of central pathological mechanisms of OTS has increased significantly, there remains
a strong demand for relevant tools for the early identification of OTS. Until a definitive evaluative tool is developed, coaches and athletes need to use performance decrements as verification that overtraining is evident.
The following criteria may be considered:
1. Is the athlete experiencing any of the following symptoms?
e Unexplained underperformance
e Persistent fatigue
e Increased sense of effort during training
e Disordered sleep patterns
e Loss of appetite
2. Are the athlete's scores in maximal exercise tests, sport-specific performance tests, or vital signs
assessments (heart rate, blood pressure) poorer than on previous tests or what would be considered
normal or baseline?

3. Are there errors in the design of the athlete's training program?
e Training volume increased significantly (<5%)
e Training intensity increased significantly
e Training monotony present
e High number or frequency of competitions

4. Are there other confounding factors?
e Psychological signs and symptoms (disturbed Profile of Mood States [POMS], higher than normal
rating of perceived exertion [RPE]})
e Social factors (family, relationships, finances, work, coach, team)
e Recent or multiple time zone travel
5. Does the athlete have any common exclusion criteria?
Confounding illnesses
Anemia
Infectious diseases

Muscle damage (high creatine kinase levels)
Endocrine disorders (diabetes, catecholamines, adrenal, thyroid)
Major eating disorders
Biological abnormalities (C-reactive protein, creatinine, decreased ferritin)
Musculoskeletal injury
Cardiologic symptoms
Adult-onset asthma
e Allergies
It should be noted that no single marker can be taken as an indicator of impending OTS. A plethora of research
(140, 185, 194) suggests that OTS is multifactorial in its nature and that regular monitoring of a combination
of performance, physiological, biochemical, immunological, and psychological variables should be considered.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

that take place in response to the training stimulus. A
mistake in the prescription of any acute program variable
could theoretically contribute to OTS if it is consistently
repeated over time. This can often occur when highly
motivated athletes use a high volume of heavy training
loads with high training frequency and take limited rest
to recover between workouts. Training volume has been
shown to be important for augmenting continued gains in
performance. Conversely, however, an excessively high
volume of exercise can create a stimulus that exceeds
the athlete’s ability to recover from the stress and may
result in excessive soreness and residual fatigue. Training
periodization should therefore consist of careful planning
to avoid overtraining.

Hormonal Markers
of Anaerobic Overtraining
Regular monitoring of performance standards is central
in any attempt to avoid the onset of NFOT or OTS, but
some researchers have used biological markers to try to
characterize anaerobic overtraining. Indeed, it has long
been hypothesized that endocrine factors mediate the
central dysfunction that occurs during the pathogenesis
of OTS (140).
The resting plasma testosterone/cortisol ratio has
long been considered an indicator of an overtraining
state. This ratio decreases in relation to the intensity and
duration of exercise; however, it is now evident that it

indicates only the actual physiological strain of training and cannot be used for diagnostic purposes (43). A
blunted rise in pituitary hormones (adrenocorticotropic
hormone [ACTH], growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) in response
to a stressful stimulus has been reported (194). However,
despite this seemingly uniform acute hormonal response
following exercise, explaining the disturbance in the
neuroendocrine system caused by OTS is not simple.
Indeed, whether peripheral metabolic hormones can
be used as accurate markers of OTS remains a topic of
ongoing discussion. In efforts to predict overtraining
responses from FOR, decreased resting concentrations
of testosterone and IGF-I have been observed (159);
but in response to resistance exercise, augmented acute
testosterone responses are found in trained individuals
with previous exposure to overreaching (61). Volume-related overtraining has been shown to increase cortisol
and to decrease resting luteinizing hormone and total
and free testosterone concentrations (58). In addition,

the exercise-induced elevation in total testosterone can
potentially be blunted (79).
Intensity-related overtraining does not appear to
alter resting concentrations of hormones (58). Fry and
colleagues (60) reported no changes in circulating testos-

terone, free testosterone, cortisol, and growth hormone

concentrations during high-intensity anaerobic overtraining (e.g., 10 IRM sets of the squat exercise each day
for two weeks). Interestingly, Meeusen and colleagues
(141) have reported that the training status of an athlete
has an impact on hypothalamic—pituitary reactivity, with
differing neuroendocrine responses exhibited in response
to NFOR. Initially, highly trained athletes are likely to
experience a large, hypersensitive sympathetic hormone
response, following which a suppression of circulating
hormone concentrations will occur that reflects a downregulation of pituitary sensitivity and long-term pituitary
exhaustion (141). Collectively, endocrine responses
appear to require longer than one week of monitoring in
order to serve as adequate markers. What remains clear,
however, is that the most effective biological markers are
perhaps those that allow for early detection of NFOR,
and it is this early recognition that will support the prevention of OTS.

Psychological Factors in Overtraining
Mood disturbances and psychological symptoms, as
determined from the Profile of Mood States (POMS),
have been associated with OTS in athletes for many
years. Heavy resistance training is accompanied by
decreased vigor, motivation, and confidence; raised
levels of tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion,

anxiety, and irritability; and impaired concentration
(110). Altered psychological characteristics are also
related to changing endocrine profiles (141). Many
athletes sense overtraining by the associated psychological alterations that are often observed before actual
decrements in performance occur. Monitoring the mood
and mental state of an athlete is very important to gain
insights into overtraining (111, 140).

Detraining
Detraining is the term given to a decrement in performance and loss of the accumulated physiological
adaptations following the cessation of anaerobic training
or when there is a substantial reduction in frequency,
volume, intensity, or any combination of these variables.
According to the principles of reversibility, training-induced adaptations are transient and thus can disappear
when the training load is insufficient or removed completely. The result is a partial or complete loss of the
anatomical, physiological, and performance adaptations
that have been made. The magnitude of these losses is
dependent on the length of the detraining period as well
as the initial training status of the individual.
Following the removal ofa training stimulus is a lag
time before the effects of detraining are fully observed.


Adaptations to Anaerobic Training Programs

Strength performance in general is readily maintained
for up to four weeks of inactivity; but in highly trained
athletes, eccentric force and sport-specific power may
decline significantly faster (146). In trained weightlifters,
removing the training stimulus for 14 days did not significantly affect 1RM strength performance in the bench
press (—1.7%) and squat (—0.9%), isometric (-7%) and
isokinetic concentric knee extension force (—2.3%), or
vertical jump performance (1.2%) (88). In recreationally
trained men, very little change is seen during the first
six weeks of detraining (108). Longer periods of training
cessation are accompanied by significantly pronounced
declines in the strength performance of strength-trained
athletes (146), but this loss is still limited to 7% to 12%
during periods ofinactivity ranging from 8 to 12 weeks.
This strength loss is coupled with decreased average
maximal bilateral and unilateral intramuscular EMG.
Indeed, strength reductions appear related to neural
mechanisms initially, with atrophy predominating as the
detraining period extends. Interestingly, the amount of
muscle strength retained 1s rarely lower than pretraining
values, indicating that resistance training has a residual
effect when the stimulus is removed. However, when
the athlete returns to training, the rate of strength reattainment is high, supporting the paradigm of “muscle
memory.”
With respect to muscle fiber characteristics following
the cessation of training, it appears that fiber disruption
remains unchanged during the initial weeks of inactivity,
but oxidative fibers may increase in strength-trained
athletes (decrease in endurance athletes) within eight
weeks of stopping training (146). In strength-trained
athletes, 14 days of inactivity has been reported to
have no effect on muscle fiber type distribution (88). In
comparison, muscle fiber cross-sectional area declines
rapidly in strength and sprint athletes (146). In 12 trained
weightlifters, Hortobagyi and colleagues (88) observed
a decline of 6.4% in fast-twitch fiber cross-sectional
area in 14 days. These changes specifically targeted
fast-twitch fibers initially, with no significant change
immediately found in the slow-twitch fiber population.
Longer periods of stoppage bring about declines in

both fast- and slow-twitch fiber cross-sectional area
and muscle mass in anaerobically trained athletes. In
professional rugby league players, cross-sectional area
of fast-twitch fibers decreased more than that of slowtwitch fibers, with the former being 23% larger at the
end of a competitive season but only 9% larger after six
weeks without training (8). After seven months with no
training, an average of 37.1% atrophy was observed in all
fiber types of apowerlifter (182); in elite body builders
after 13.5 months without training, fat-free mass, thigh

and arm girth, and average fiber area decreased by 9.3%,
0.5%, 11.5%, and 8.3%, respectively (72).

Conclusion
Anaerobic exercise represents a specific type oftraining
stress to the anatomy and various systems of the body,
and adaptations consequent to anaerobic training are
specific to the nature of the exercise performed. It is
also apparent that an individual’s age, nutrition, prior
fitness level, and training motivation can affect adaptations. Integration of a training program that has many
components requires careful planning and monitoring
in order to minimize the occurrence of incompatibilities or overtraining. Explosive training evokes marked
increases in muscular power, whereas more conventional
heavy resistance training mainly increases muscle size
and strength. Anaerobic training (resistance, sprint, plyometric, agility, high-intensity interval training) in general
elicits specific adaptations in the nervous system leading
to greater recruitment, rate of firing, synchronization,
and enhanced muscle function that enable increases in
strength and power.
Anaerobic training also has positive effects on bone,
muscle, and the associated connective tissue; the entire

musculoskeletal system undergoes a coordinated adaptation to exercise. Athletes undertaking strenuous exercise
training experience changes in the force-generating
capabilities of muscle, resulting in a coordinated and
proportional increase in the load-bearing capacity of
bone and other connective tissue. Anaerobic training
can increase skeletal muscle mass, force-generating
capability, and metabolic capacity and may lead to
subtle alterations of the endocrine system that enhance
the tissue remodeling process.
Anaerobic training generally results in fewer acute
and chronic responses in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, although low-intensity, high-volume resistance exercise produces some responses that are similar
to those with aerobic exercise. Collectively, improved
neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and car-

diovascular function contribute to enhanced muscle
strength, power, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, and
motor performance—all of which contribute to increased
athletic performance. The adaptations observed in athletes are directly related to the quality of the exercise
stimulus and accordingly to the levels of progressive
overload, specificity, and variation incorporated into
program design. The scientific basis of program design
is ultimately seen in the effectiveness with which the
athlete improves performance.
