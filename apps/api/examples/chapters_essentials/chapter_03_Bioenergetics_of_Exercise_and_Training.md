Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Metabolic specificity of exercise and training is based
on an understanding of the transfer of energy in biological systems. Efficient and productive training programs
can be designed through an understanding of how energy
is made available for specific types of exercise and how
energy transfer can be modified by specific training regimens. After defining essential bioenergetics terminology
and explaining the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
this chapter discusses the three basic energy systems that
work to replenish ATP in human skeletal muscle. Then
we look at substrate depletion and repletion, especially
as they relate to fatigue and recovery; bioenergetic factors that limit performance; and aerobic and anaerobic
contributions to oxygen uptake. Finally, the metabolic
specificity of training is discussed.

Essential Terminology
Bioenergetics, or the flow of energy in a biological
system, concerns primarily the conversion of macronutrients—carbohydrate, protein, and fats, which contain
chemical energy—into biologically usable forms of
energy. It is the breakdown of the chemical bonds in
these macronutrients that provides the energy necessary
to perform biological work.
The breakdown oflarge molecules into smaller molecules, associated with the release of energy, is termed
catabolism. The synthesis of larger molecules from
smaller molecules can be accomplished using the energy
released from catabolic reactions; this building-up process is termed anabolism. The breakdown of protein
into amino acids is an example of catabolism, while the
formation of protein from amino acids is an anabolic
process. Exergonic reactions are energy-releasing reactions and are generally catabolic. Endergonic reactions
require energy and include anabolic processes and the
contraction of muscle. Metabolism is the total of all
the catabolic or exergonic and anabolic or endergonic
reactions in a biological system. Energy derived from
catabolic or exergonic reactions is used to drive anabolic or endergonic reactions through an intermediate
molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine
triphosphate allows the transfer of energy from exergonic
to endergonic reactions. Without an adequate supply of
ATP, muscular activity and muscle growth would not be
possible. Thus, it is apparent that when designing training programs, strength and conditioning professionals
need to have a basic understanding of how exercise
affects ATP hydrolysis and resynthesis.
Adenosine triphosphate is composed of adenosine
and three phosphate groups (figure 3.1). Adenosine
is the combination of adenine (a nitrogen-containing
base) and ribose (a five-carbon sugar). The breakdown

of one molecule of ATP to yield energy is known as
hydrolysis, because it requires one molecule of water.
The hydrolysis of ATP is catalyzed by the presence of
an enzyme called adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase).
Specifically, myosin ATPase is the enzyme that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis for crossbridge recycling. Other
specific enzymes hydrolyze ATP at other locations,
such as calcium ATPase for pumping calcium into the
sarcoplasmic reticulum and sodium-potassium ATPase
for maintaining the sarcolemmal concentration gradient
after depolarization (59). The following equation depicts
the reactants (left), enzyme (middle), and products (right)
of ATP hydrolysis:

ATP + H,O <4/78> ADP +P. +H*+Energy

(3.1)

where ADP represents adenosine diphosphate (only
two phosphate groups, figure 3.1), P. is an inorganic
phosphate molecule, and H” is a hydrogen ion (proton).
Further hydrolysis of ADP cleaves the second phosphate
group and yields adenosine monophosphate (AMP).
The energy released primarily from the hydrolysis of
ATP and secondarily from ADP results in biological
work.
Adenosine triphosphate is classified as a high-energy
molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the
chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups.
Because muscle cells store ATP only in limited amounts
and activity requires a constant supply of ATP to provide
the energy needed for muscle actions, ATP-producing
processes must occur in the cell.

Biological Energy Systems
Three basic energy systems exist in mammalian muscle
cells to replenish ATP (85, 122):

¢ Phosphagen system

* Glycolysis
* Oxidative system

In discussion of exercise-related bioenergetics, the
terms anaerobic and aerobic metabolism are often
used. Anaerobic processes do not require the presence
of oxygen, whereas aerobic mechanisms depend on
oxygen. The phosphagen and glycolytic systems are
anaerobic mechanisms that occur in the sarcoplasm of a
muscle cell. The Krebs cycle, electron transport, and the
rest of the oxidative system are aerobic mechanisms that
occur in the mitochondria of muscle cells and require
oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.
Of the three main macronutrients—carbohydrate,
protein, and fats—only carbohydrate can be metabolized
for energy without the direct involvement of oxygen

Energy stored in the chemical bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is used to power

The replenishment of ATP

by three basic energy systems: (a) phosphagen, (b) glycolytic, and (c) oxidative.

(21). Therefore, carbohydrate is critical during anaerobic
metabolism. All three energy systems are active at any
given time; however, the magnitude of the contribution
of each system to overall work performance is primarily
dependent on the intensity of the activity and secondarily
on the duration (45, 85).




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Phosphagen System
The phosphagen system provides ATP primarily for
short-term, high-intensity activities (e.g., resistance
training and sprinting) and is highly active at the start
ofall exercise regardless ofintensity (62, 70, 153). This
energy system relies on the hydrolysis of ATP (equation
3.1) and breakdown of another high-energy phosphate
molecule called creatine phosphate (CP), also called
phosphocreatine (PCr). Creatine kinase is the enzyme
that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from CP and ADP in
the following reaction:

ADP e Gp cman lanes

ATP

Creatine

(i2)

Creatine phosphate supplies a phosphate group that
combines with ADP to replenish ATP. The creatine
kinase reaction provides energy at a high rate; however,
because CP is stored in relatively small amounts, the
phosphagen system cannot be the primary supplier of
energy for continuous, long-duration activities (30).

ATP Stores
The body stores approximately 80 to 100 g (about 3
ounces) of ATP at any given time, which does not represent a significant energy reserve for exercise (107). In
addition, ATP stores cannot be completely depleted due
to the necessity for basic cellular function. In fact, ATP
concentrations may decrease by up to 50% to 60% (34,
71, 100, 143) of the preexercise levels during experimentally induced muscle fatigue. Therefore, the phosphagen
system uses the creatine kinase reaction (equation 3.2)
to maintain the concentration of ATP. Under normal
circumstances, skeletal muscle concentrations of CP

are four to six times higher than ATP concentrations
(107). Therefore, the phosphagen system, through CP
and the creatine kinase reaction, serves as an energy
reserve for rapidly replenishing ATP. In addition, Type II
(fast-twitch) muscle fibers contain higher concentrations
of CP than Type I (slow-twitch) fibers (95, 132); thus,
individuals with higher percentages of Type II fibers may
be able to replenish ATP faster through the phosphagen
system during anaerobic, explosive exercise.
Another important single-enzyme reaction that can
rapidly replenish ATP is the adenylate kinase (also
called myokinase) reaction:
2ADP

<

Adenylate kinase

> ATP

+ AMP

(3.3)

This reaction is particularly important because AMP, a
product of the adenylate kinase (myokinase) reaction, is
a powerful stimulant of glycolysis (22, 28).

Control of the Phosphagen System
The reactions of the phosphagen system (often represented by equations 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) are largely

controlled by the law of mass action or the mass
action effect (107). The law of mass action states that
the concentrations of reactants or products (or both) in
solution will drive the direction of the reactions. With
enzyme-mediated reactions, such as the reactions of
the phosphagen system, the rate of product formation is
greatly influenced by the concentrations of the reactants.
This is denoted in equations 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 by the twoway arrow between reactants and products. For example,
as ATP is hydrolyzed to yield the energy necessary for
exercise (equation 3.1), there is a transient increase in
ADP concentrations (as well as P.) in the sarcolemma.
This will increase the rate of the creatine kinase and
adenylate kinase reaction (equations 3.2 and 3.3) to
replenish the ATP supply. The process will continue until
(a) the exercise ceases or (b) the intensity is low enough
that it does not deplete CP stores and it allows glycolysis
or the oxidative system to become the primary supplier
of ATP and rephosphorylate the free creatine (equation
3.2) (37). At this point, the sarcoplasmic concentration
of ATP will remain steady or increase, which will slow
down or reverse the directions of the creatine kinase and
adenylate kinase reactions. As a result, equations 3.1,

3.2, and 3.3 are often referred to as near-equilibrium
reactions that proceed in a direction dictated by the concentrations of the reactants due to the law of mass action.

Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the breakdown of carbohydrate—either
glycogen stored in the muscle or glucose delivered in
the blood—to resynthesize ATP (22, 143). The process
of glycolysis involves multiple enzymatically catalyzed
reactions (figure 3.2). As a result, the ATP resynthesis
rate during glycolysis is not as rapid as with the single-step phosphagen system; however, the capacity
to produce ATP is much higher due to a larger supply
of glycogen and glucose compared to CP. As with the
phosphagen system, glycolysis occurs in the sarcoplasm.
As depicted in figure 3.2, pyruvate, the end result of
glycolysis, may proceed in one of two directions:
1. Pyruvate can be converted to lactate in the sarcoplasm.

2. Pyruvate can be shuttled into the mitochondria.
When pyruvate is converted to lactate, ATP resynthesis occurs at a faster rate via the rapid regeneration of
NAD‘, but is limited in duration due to the subsequent
H" production and resulting decrease in cytosolic pH.
This process is sometimes called anaerobic glycolysis
(or fast glycolysis). However, when pyruvate is shuttled
into the mitochondria to undergo the Krebs cycle, the
ATP resynthesis rate is slower because of the numerous
reactions, but can occur for a longer duration if the

exercise intensity is low enough. This process is often
referred to as aerobic glycolysis (or slow glycolysis).
At higher exercise intensities, pyruvate and NADH will
increase above what can be handled by pyruvate dehydrogenase and will then be converted into lactate and
NAD*. Unfortunately, because glycolysis itself does not
depend on oxygen, the terms anaerobic and aerobic (or
fast and slow, respectively) glycolysis are probably not
practical for describing the processes. Nevertheless, the
fate of pyruvate is ultimately controlled by the energy
demands within the cell. If energy demand is high and

must be transferred quickly, as during resistance training,
pyruvate is primarily converted to lactate for further
support of anaerobic glycolysis. If energy demand is
not as high and oxygen is present in sufficient quantities in the cell, pyruvate can be further oxidized in the
mitochondria.

Glycolysis and the Formation of Lactate
The formation of lactate from pyruvate is catalyzed by
the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Sometimes, mistakenly, the end result of this reaction is said to be the




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

formation of lactic acid. However, due to the physiological pH (i.e., near 7) and earlier steps in glycolysis
that consume protons (123), lactate—rather than lactic
acid—is the product of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. Although the muscular fatigue experienced during
exercise often correlates with high tissue concentrations
of lactate, lactate is not the cause of fatigue (22, 27,
123). Proton (H*) accumulation during fatigue reduces
the intracellular pH, inhibits glycolytic reactions, and
directly interferes with muscle’s excitation—contraction
coupling—possibly by inhibiting calcium binding to
troponin (57, 113) or by interfering with crossbridge
recycling (51, 57, 78, 113, 144). Also, the decrease in
pH inhibits the enzymatic turnover rate of the cell’s
energy systems (9, 78). Overall, this process of an exercise-induced decrease in pH is referred to as metabolic
acidosis (123), and may be responsible for much of the
peripheral fatigue that occurs during exercise (42, 154).
More recently, the role of metabolic acidosis in peripheral fatigue has been questioned (128); and other factors
have been reported to play a prominent role in peripheral
fatigue, such as an increased interstitial K* concentration
and P. that impairs Ca‘ release (118, 137). However,
evidence suggests that other mechanisms, such as the
simple hydrolysis of ATP (equation 3.1), are responsible
for most of the H* accumulation and that lactate itself
actually works to decrease metabolic acidosis rather than
accelerate it (27, 123). See the sidebar titled “Lactic Acid
Does Not Cause Metabolic Acidosis!” In fact, lactate is

often used as an energy substrate, especially in Type I
and cardiac muscle fibers (10, 106, 160). It is also used
in gluconeogenesis—the formation of glucose from
noncarbohydrate sources—during extended exercise
and recovery (19, 106).
Normally there is a low concentration of lactate in
blood and muscle. The reported normal range of lactate
concentration in blood is 0.5 to 2.2 mmol/L at rest (67)
and 0.5 to 2.2 mmol for each kilogram of wet muscle
(muscle that has not been desiccated) (67). Lactate production increases with exercise intensity (67, 127) and
appears to depend on muscle fiber type. Researchers
have reported that the maximal rate of lactate production
for Type II muscle fibers is 0.5 mmol-g™'-s"! (46, 105)
and for Type I muscle is 0.25 mmol-g'!-s! (111). The
higher rate of lactate production by Type II muscle fibers
may reflect a higher concentration or activity of glycolytic enzymes than in Type I muscle fibers (10, 120).
Although the highest possible concentration of lactate
accumulation is not known, severe fatigue may occur at
blood concentrations between 20 and 25 mmol/L (105);

training (66), and initial glycogen levels (67) can also
influence lactate accumulation.
Blood lactate concentrations reflect the net balance
of lactate production and clearance as a result of bicarbonate (HCO,)buffering. HCO, minimizes the disrupting influence of the H* on pH by accepting’ the proton ~
(H,CO,). The clearance and buffering of lactate from the
blood reflect a return to homeostatic range. Lactate can
be cleared by oxidation within the muscle fiber in which
it was produced, or it can be transported in the blood to
other muscle fibers to be oxidized (106). Lactate can
also be transported in the blood to the liver, where it is
converted to glucose. This process is referred to as the
Cori cycle and is depicted in figure 3.3.
Gollnick and colleagues (67) and others (8, 72, 116)
have reported that blood lactate concentrations normally
return to preexercise values within an hour after activity,
depending on the duration and intensity of exercise,
training status, and type of recovery (1.e., passive versus
active). Light activity during the postexercise period has
been shown to increase lactate clearance rates (55, 67,

72, 79, 116). For example, an active recovery following
a 200-yard (182.9 m) maximal-effort swim resulted in
the greatest lactate clearance in comparison to a passive
recovery in competitive swimmers (72). In addition, both
aerobically trained (67) and anaerobically trained (62)
athletes have faster lactate clearance rates than untrained
people. Peak blood lactate concentrations occur approximately 5 minutes after the cessation of exercise (67), a
delay frequently attributed to the time required to buffer
and transport lactate from the tissue to the blood (93).
Blood lactate accumulation is greater following
high-intensity, intermittent exercise (e.g., resistance
training and sprints) than following lower-intensity,
continuous exercise (79, 101, 150). However, trained

people experience lower blood lactate concentrations

Lactic Acid Does Not Cause Metabolic Acidosis!
Lactic acidosis is a common

misnomer, as lactic acid is inaccurately believed to cause the burning sensations

experienced with muscle fatigue during high-intensity exercise. This is based on the assumption that there
is an immediate dissociation of lactic acid into lactate and H* when produced by glycolysis in skeletal muscle
(1, 60, 123). However, the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction of glycolysis involves the transfer of a phosphate
leaving a carboxylate (COO-) group (103). Thus, as shown in figure 3.4, no proton (H*) exists to dissociate
from lactate (60, 123).

FIGURE 3.4 The phosphoglycerate kinase reaction of glycolysis, illustrating that there is
no proton (H*) to dissociate from lactate.

Furthermore, the lactate dehydrogenase reaction itself consumes protons, which alkalizes the cell (60,
123)—quite the opposite of acidosis. In fact, Busa and Nuccitelli (27) stated, “ATP hydrolysis, not lactate
accumulation, is the dominant source of the intracellular acid load. . " (p. 430). The take-home message from
Robergs and colleagues (123) is that the hydrolysis of ATP outside the mitochondria is primarily responsible for
the proton (H*) accumulation during exercise-induced metabolic acidosis—not the conversion of pyruvate to
lactate as is commonly believed. Consequently, the term /actic acidosis is indeed a misnomer, and the term
metabolic acidosis is recommended to describe the reduced pH within skeletal muscle during high-intensity,
fatiguing exercise.

than untrained people when exercising at an absolute
workload (same resistance) (66, 89, 141). This indicates
that resistance training results in alterations in lactate
response similar to those from aerobic endurance training (67, 89, 141). These alterations include a lower blood
lactate concentration at a given workload in trained individuals and higher blood lactate concentrations in trained
individuals during maximal exercise (67, 89, 141).
The net reaction for glycolysis when pyruvate is
converted to lactate may be summarized as follows:

(CoA stands for coenzyme A) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in the loss of a carbon
as CO,. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the Krebs cycle for
further ATP resynthesis. The NADH molecules enter the
electron transport system, where they can also be used
to resynthesize ATP.
The net reaction for glycolysis when pyruvate is shuttled to the mitochondria may be summarized as follows:

Glycolysis Leading to the Krebs Cycle
If oxygen is present in sufficient quantities in the mitochondria (specialized cellular organelles where the
reactions of aerobic metabolism occur), the end product
of glycolysis, pyruvate, is not converted to lactate but is
transported into the mitochondria. Also transported are
two molecules of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) produced during glycolytic reactions
(reduced refers to the added hydrogen). When pyruvate
enters the mitochondria, it is converted to acetyl-CoA

Energy Yield of Glycolysis
There are two primary mechanisms for resynthesizing
ATP during metabolism:
1. Substrate-level phosphorylation
2. Oxidative phosphorylation

Phosphorylation is the process of adding an inorganic phosphate (P,) to another molecule. For example,
ADP + P.— ATP is the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.
Oxidative phosphorylation refers to the resynthesis of




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

ATP in the electron transport chain (ETC). In contrast,
substrate-level phosphorylation refers to the direct
resynthesis of ATP from ADP during a single reaction
in the metabolic pathways. To illustrate, in glycolysis
there are two steps that result in substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (42):

The gross number of ATP molecules that are resynthesized as a result of substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis is four (figure 3.2). However,
the reaction that converts fructose-6-phosphate to
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (catalyzed by the enzyme
phosphofructokinase [PFK]) in glycolysis requires
the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. In addition, there
are two possible sources of glucose: blood glucose and
muscle glycogen. When blood glucose enters the muscle
cell, it must be phosphorylated to remain in the cell and
to maintain the glucose concentration gradient (67).
The phosphorylation of one molecule of blood glucose,
which is catalyzed by hexokinase, also requires the
hydrolysis of one ATP. In contrast, when muscle glycogen is broken down (i.e., glycogenolysis) to glucose
with the help of the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, the
glucose is already phosphorylated, and it does not require
the hydrolysis of ATP. Therefore, when glycolysis begins
with one molecule of blood glucose, two ATP molecules
are used and four ATP are resynthesized, which results
in a net resynthesis of two ATP molecules. When glycolysis begins from muscle glycogen, only one ATP is
used and four ATP are resynthesized, which yields a net
resynthesis of three ATP molecules.

Control of Glycolysis
In general, the rate of glycolysis is stimulated to increase
during intense muscle actions by high concentrations of
ADP, P., and ammonia and by a slight decrease in pH and
AMP (22, 61, 140), all of which are signs of increased
ATP hydrolysis and a need for energy. In contrast,
glycolysis is inhibited by markedly lower pH, ATP, CP,
citrate, and free fatty acids (22), which are usually present at rest. (Note that a slight decrease in pH increases
glycolysis, but if pH continues to decrease significantly
it will inhibit the rate of glycolysis.) However, there are
more specific factors that contribute to the regulation
of glycolysis (107), such as the concentrations and
turnover rates of three important glycolytic enzymes:
hexokinase, PFK, and pyruvate kinase. All three of these
are regulatory enzymes in glycolysis, because each has

important allosteric (meaning “other site”) binding sites.
Allosteric regulation occurs when the end product of a
reaction or series of reactions feeds back to regulate the
turnover rate of key enzymes in the metabolic pathways.
Consequently, this process is also called end product
regulation (85) or feedback regulation (61). Allosteric
inhibition occurs when an end product binds to the
regulatory enzyme and decreases its turnover rate and
slows product formation. In contrast, allosteric activation occurs when an “activator” binds with the enzyme
and increases its turnover rate.
Hexokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of
glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, is allosterically inhibited by the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate in the
sarcoplasm (61). Thus, the higher the concentration of
glucose-6-phosphate, the more hexokinase will be inhibited. In addition, the phosphorylation of glucose commits
it to the cell so that it cannot leave. Similarly, the PFK
reaction (fructose-6-phosphate — fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) commits the cell to metabolizing glucose
rather than storing it as glycogen. Phosphofructokinase
is the most important regulator of glycolysis because it
is the rate-limiting step. Adenosine triphosphate is an
allosteric inhibitor of PFK; therefore, as intracellular
ATP concentrations rise, PFK activity decreases and

reduces the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and, subsequently, decreases
activity of the glycolytic pathway. However, AMP is an
allosteric activator of PFK and a powerful stimulator
of glycolysis. Moreover, the ammonia produced during
high-intensity exercise as a result of AMP or amino
acid deamination (removing the amine group from the
amino acid molecule) can also stimulate PFK. Pyruvate
kinase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate
to pyruvate and is the final regulatory enzyme. Pyruvate
kinase is allosterically inhibited by ATP and acetyl-CoA
(the latter is a Krebs cycle intermediate) and activated
by high concentrations of AMP and fructose-1,6bisphosphate (61).

Lactate Threshold and Onset
of Blood Lactate Accumulation
Recent evidence suggests that there are specific break
points in the lactate accumulation curve (figure 3.5) as
exercise intensity increases (39, 98). The exercise intensity or relative intensity at which blood lactate begins
an abrupt increase above the baseline concentration has
been termed the lactate threshold (LT) (161). The LT
represents a significantly increased reliance on anaerobic
mechanisms for energy production to meet demand.
The LT corresponds well with the ventilatory threshold
(breaking point in the relationship between ventilation
and VO,) and is often used as a marker of the anaerobic
threshold.

FIGURE 3.5

Lactate threshold (LT) and onset of blood lactate accumulation

The LT typically begins at 50% to 60% of maximal
oxygen uptake in untrained individuals and at 70% to
80% in aerobically trained athletes (29, 52). A second
increase in the rate of lactate accumulation has been
noted at higher relative intensities of exercise. This
second point of inflection has been termed the onset of
blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) and occurs when
the concentration of blood lactate reaches 4 mmol/L (83,
136, 142). The breaks in the lactate accumulation curve

may correspond to the points at which intermediate and
large motor units are recruited during increasing exercise intensities (92). The muscle cells associated with
large motor units are typically Type II fibers, which are
particularly suited for anaerobic metabolism and lactate
production.
Some studies suggest that training at intensities near
or above the LT or OBLA pushes the LT and OBLA to the
right (i.e., lactate accumulation occurs later at a higher
exercise intensity) (39, 43). This shift probably occurs
as a result of changes in hormone release, particularly
reduced catecholamine release at high exercise intensities, and increased mitochondrial content that allows for

greater production of ATP through aerobic mechanisms.
The shift allows the athlete to perform at higher percentages of maximal oxygen uptake without as much lactate
accumulation in the blood (22, 41).

The Oxidative (Aerobic) System
The oxidative system, the primary source of ATP at
rest and during low-intensity activities, uses primarily

(OBLA).

carbohydrate and fats as substrates (62). Protein does
not provide a significant contribution to total energy;

however, the use of protein does significantly increase
during long-term starvation and long bouts (>90 minutes) of exercise (41, 102). At rest, approximately 70%
of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from
carbohydrate. Following the onset of activity, as the
intensity of the exercise increases, there is a shift in
substrate preference from fats to carbohydrate. During
high-intensity aerobic exercise, alinost 100% of the
energy is derived from carbohydrate if an adequate
supply is available, with only minimal contributions
from fats and protein. However, during prolonged,
submaximal, steady-state work, there is a gradual shift
from carbohydrate back to fats, and to a very small extent
protein, as energy substrates (22).

Glucose and Glycogen Oxidation
The oxidative metabolism of blood glucose and muscle
glycogen begins with glycolysis. If oxygen is present
in sufficient quantities, the end product of glycolysis,
pyruvate, is not converted to lactate but is transported
to the mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA
(a two-carbon molecule), which enters the Krebs cycle,

also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid
cycle (7, 61). The Krebs cycle is a series of reactions
that continues the oxidation of the substrate from glycolysis and produces two ATP indirectly from guanine
triphosphate (GTP), via substrate-level phosphorylation,
for each molecule of glucose (figure 3.6).

Also produced from the two pyruvate molecules
subsequent to the production of one molecule of glucose are six molecules of NADH and two molecules of
reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH,). These
molecules transport hydrogen atoms to the ETC to be
used to produce ATP from ADP (22, 107). The ETC uses
the NADH and FADH, molecules to rephosphorylate
ADP to ATP (figure 3.7).

The hydrogen atoms are passed down the chain (a
series of electron carriers known as cytochromes) to
form a proton concentration gradient, which provides
the energy for ATP production, with oxygen serving as
the final electron acceptor (resulting in the formation of
water). Because NADH and FADH, enter the ETC at

FIGURE 3.7

different sites, they differ in their ability to produce ATP.
One molecule of NADH can produce three molecules of
ATP, whereas one molecule of FADH, can produce only
two molecules of ATP. The production of ATP during
this process is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation.
The oxidative system, beginning with glycolysis and
including the Krebs cycle and ETC, results in the production of approximately 38 ATP from the degradation
of one molecule of blood glucose (22, 85). However, if
the initiation of glycolysis is muscle glycogen, the net
ATP production is 39, since the hexokinase reaction is
not necessary with muscle glycogenolysis. Nevertheless,
oxidative phosphorylation accounts for over 90% of ATP
synthesis compared to substrate-level phosphorylation,

these processes.

fat oxidation is capable of a tremendous capacity for
ATP synthesis compared to carbohydrate and protein
oxidation.

Fat Oxidation

Protein Oxidation

Fats can also be used by the oxidative energy system.
Triglycerides stored in fat cells can be broken down by an
enzyme, hormone-sensitive lipase, to produce free fatty
acids and glycerol. This releases a portion of the total
free fatty acids from the fat cells into the blood, where
they can circulate and enter muscle fibers and undergo
oxidation (88, 121). Additionally, limited quantities of
triglycerides are stored within the muscle along with a
form of hormone-sensitive lipase to produce an intramuscular source of free fatty acids (22, 47). Free fatty
acids enter the mitochondria, where they undergo beta
oxidation, a series of reactions in which the free fatty

Although not a significant source of energy for most
activities, protein can be broken down into its constituent
amino acids by various metabolic processes. Most of
these amino acids can then be converted into glucose
(in a process known as gluconeogenesis), pyruvate, or
various Krebs cycle intermediates to produce ATP (figure
3.6). The contribution of amino acids to the production of
ATP has been estimated to be minimal during short-term
exercise but may contribute 3% to 18% of the energy
requirements during prolonged activity (20, 138). The
major amino acids that are oxidized in skeletal muscle
are believed to be the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), although alanine, aspartate,
and glutamate may also be used (69). The nitrogenous
waste products of amino acid degradation are eliminated
through the formation of urea and small amounts of

acids are broken down, resulting in the formation of

acetyl-CoA and hydrogen protons (figure 3.6). The acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle directly, and the hydrogen
atoms are carried by NADH and FADH, to the ETC (22).
The result is hundreds of ATP molecules supplied by
beta oxidation. For example, the breakdown of a single
triglyceride molecule containing three 16-carbon chain
free fatty acids (palmitic acid) can be metabolized by
beta oxidation to yield over 300 ATP molecules (>100
ATP per palmitic acid). The overarching concept is that

ammonia (22). The elimination through formation of

ammonia is significant because ammonia is toxic and
is associated with fatigue.

Control of the Oxidative (Aerobic) System
The rate-limiting step in the Krebs cycle (see figure
3.6) is the conversion of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate,
a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is stimulated by ADP
and allosterically inhibited by ATP. The reactions that
produce NADH or FADH, also influence the regulation
of the Krebs cycle. If NAD* and FAD” are not available
in sufficient quantities to accept hydrogen, the rate of the
Krebs cycle is reduced. Also, when GTP accumulates,
the concentration of succinyl CoA increases, which
inhibits the initial reaction (oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA
— citrate + CoA) of the Krebs cycle. The ETC is inhibited by ATP and stimulated by ADP (22). A simplified
overview of the metabolism of fat, carbohydrate, and
protein is presented in figure 3.8.

Energy Production and Capacity
The phosphagen, glycolytic, and oxidative energy
systems differ in their ability to supply energy for
activities of various intensities and durations (tables
3.2 and 3.3). Exercise intensity is defined as a level
of muscular activity that can be quantified in terms of
power (work performed per unit of time) output (99).
Activities such as resistance training performed at a
high power output require a rapid rate of energy supply
and rely almost entirely on the energy provided by the

phosphagen system. Activities that are of low intensity
but long duration, such as marathon running, require a
prolonged energy supply and rely predominantly on the
energy supplied by the oxidative energy system. The
primary source of energy for activities between these two

extremes shifts, depending on the intensity and duration
of the event (table 3.2). In general, short, high-intensity
activities (e.g., high-intensity resistance training and
sprinting) rely largely on the phosphagen energy system
and fast glycolysis. As the intensity decreases and duration increases, the emphasis gradually shifts to slow
glycolysis and the oxidative energy system (45, 129).


Bioenergetics

In general, there is an inverse relationship
between a given energy system’s maximum
rate of ATP production (i.e., ATP produced
per unit of time) and its capacity (i.e., the
total amount of ATP produced over time).
The phosphagen system is capable of
achieving the highest rate of ATP production,

gen energy system primarily supplies ATP
for high-intensity activities of short duration
(e.g., 100 m dash), the glycolytic system for
moderate- to high-intensity activities of
short to medium duration (e.g., 400 m dash),

and the oxidative system for low-intensity
activities of long duration (e.g., marathon).

The duration of the activity also influences which
energy system is used. Athletic events range in duration
from | to 3 seconds (e.g., snatch and shot put) to more
than 4 hours (e.g., long-distance triathlons and ultramarathons). If an athlete makes a best effort (an effort
that results in the best possible performance for a given
event), the time considerations shown in table 3.2 are
reasonable (48, 78, 124, 144, 147).

At no time, during either exercise or rest, does any
single energy system provide the complete supply of
energy. During exercise, the degree to which anaerobic
and oxidative systems contribute to the energy being
produced is determined primarily by the exercise intensity and secondarily by exercise duration (22, 45, 48).
The extent to which each of the three energy
systems contributes to ATP production
depends primarily on the intensity of muscular activity and secondarily on the duration.
At no time, during either exercise or rest,
does any single energy system provide the
complete supply of energy.

Substrate Depletion
and Repletion
Energy substrates—molecules that provide starting
materials for bioenergetic reactions, including phosphagens (ATP and CP), glucose, glycogen, lactate,
free fatty acids, and amino acids—can be selectively
depleted during the performance of activities of various
intensities and durations. Subsequently, the energy that
can be produced by the bioenergetic systems is reduced.
Fatigue experienced during many activities is frequently
associated with the depletion of phosphagens (66, 87)
and glycogen (21, 78, 90, 131); the depletion of substrates such as free fatty acids, lactate, and amino acids

typically does not occur to the extent that performance

of Exercise and Training

is limited. Consequently, the depletion and repletion
pattern of phosphagens and glycogen following physical
activity is important in exercise and sport bioenergetics.

Phosphagens
Fatigue during exercise appears to be at least partially
related to the decrease in phosphagens (i.e., ATP and
CP). Phosphagen concentrations in muscle are more
rapidly depleted as a result of high-intensity anaerobic
exercise compared to aerobic exercise (66, 87). Creatine
phosphate can decrease markedly (50-70%) during
the first stage of high-intensity exercise of short and
moderate duration (5-30 seconds) and can be almost
completely depleted as a result of very intense exercise
to exhaustion (84, 91, 96, 108). Muscle ATP concentra-

tions may decrease only slightly (34) or may decrease
up to 50% to 60% (143) ofthe preexercise levels during
experimentally induced fatigue. It should also be noted
that dynamic muscle actions that produce external work
use more metabolic energy and typically deplete phosphagens to a greater extent than do isometric muscle
actions (18).
The intramuscular ATP concentration is largely sustained during exercise as a consequence of CP depletion
and the contribution of additional ATP from the myokinase reaction and oxidation of other energy sources,
such as glycogen and free fatty acids. Postexercise phosphagen repletion can occur in a relatively short period;
complete resynthesis of ATP appears to occur within 3
to 5 minutes, and complete CP resynthesis can occur
within 8 minutes (75, 87). Repletion of phosphagens is
largely accomplished as a result of aerobic metabolism
(75), although glycolysis can contribute to recovery after
high-intensity exercise (29, 40).
The effects of training on concentrations of phosphagens are not well studied or understood. Aerobic endurance training may increase resting concentrations of
phosphagens (49, 97) and decrease their rate of depletion
at a given absolute submaximal power output (33, 97) but
not at a relative (percentage of maximum) submaximal
power output (33). Although researchers have noted
indications of increased resting concentrations of phosphagens (12, 125), short-term (eight weeks) studies of
sprint and six months of resistance or explosive training

have not shown alterations in resting concentrations of
phosphagens (11, 16, 145, 148). However, total phospha-

gen content can be larger following sprint training due
to increases in muscle mass (148). Resistance training
has been shown to increase the resting concentrations
of phosphagens in the triceps brachii after five weeks of
training (104). The increases in phosphagen concentration may have occurred due to selective hypertrophy of
Type II fibers, which can contain a higher phosphagen
concentration than Type I fibers (103).




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Glycogen
Limited stores of glycogen are available for exercise.
Approximately 300 to 400 g of glycogen are stored in
the body’s total muscle and about 70 to 100 g in the
liver (135). Resting concentrations of liver and muscle
glycogen can be influenced by training and dietary
manipulations (56, 135). Research suggests that both
anaerobic training, including sprinting and resistance
training (16, 104), and stereotypical aerobic endurance
training (64, 65) can increase resting muscle glycogen
concentration with concomitantly appropriate nutrition.
The rate of glycogen depletion is related to exercise
intensity (135). Muscle glycogen is a more important
energy source than liver glycogen during moderate- and
high-intensity exercise. Liver glycogen appears to be
more important during low-intensity exercise, and its
contribution to metabolic processes increases with duration of exercise. Increases in relative exercise intensity
of 50%, 75%, and 100% of maximal oxygen uptake
result in increases in the rate of muscle glycogenolysis
(the breakdown of glycogen) of 0.7, 1.4, and 3.4 mmol
‘kg'-min"', respectively (131). At relative intensities of
exercise above 60% of maximal oxygen uptake, muscle
glycogen becomes an increasingly important energy
substrate; the entire glycogen content of some muscle
cells can become depleted during exercise (130).
Relatively constant blood glucose concentrations are
maintained at very low exercise intensities (below 50%
of maximal oxygen uptake) as a result of low muscle
glucose uptake; as duration increases beyond 90 minutes, blood glucose concentrations fall, but rarely below
2.8 mmol/L (2). Long-term exercise (over 90 minutes)
at higher intensities (above 50% of maximal oxygen
uptake) may result in substantially decreased blood
glucose concentrations as a result of liver glycogen
depletion. Hypoglycemic reactions may occur in some
people with exercise-induced blood glucose values less
than 2.5 mmol/L (3, 35). A decline in blood glucose to
around 2.5 to 3.0 mmol/L results from reduced liver
carbohydrate stores and causes decreased carbohydrate
oxidation and eventual exhaustion (32, 35, 135).

Very high-intensity, intermittent exercise, such as
high-intensity resistance training, can cause substantial
depletion of muscle glycogen (decreases of 20% to
60%) with relatively few sets (low total workloads)
(99, 124, 144, 146). Although phosphagens may be the
primary limiting factor during resistance exercise with
high resistance and few repetitions or few sets, muscle
glycogen may become the limiting factor for resistance
training with many total sets and larger total amounts of
work (124). This type of exercise could cause selective
muscle fiber glycogen depletion (more depletion in
Type II fibers), which can also limit performance (50,
124). As with other types of dynamic exercise, the rate
of muscle glycogenolysis during resistance exercise
depends on intensity (i.e., the greater the intensity, the
faster the rate of glycogenolysis). However, it appears
that when the total work performed is equal, the absolute
amount of glycogen depletion is the same, regardless of
the intensity of the resistance training session (69, 124).
Repletion of muscle glycogen during recovery is
related to postexercise carbohydrate ingestion. Repletion
appears to be optimal if 0.7 to 3.0 g of carbohydrate
per kilogram of body weight is ingested every 2 hours
following exercise (56, 135). This level of carbohydrate
consumption can maximize muscle glycogen repletion
at 5 to 6 mmol/g of wet muscle mass per hour during the
first 4 to 6 hours following exercise. Muscle glycogen
may be completely replenished within 24 hours, provided that sufficient carbohydrate is ingested (56, 135).
However, if the exercise has a high eccentric component
(associated with exercise-induced muscle damage), more
time may be required to completely replenish muscle
glycogen (119, 162).

Bioenergetic Limiting Factors
in Exercise Performance
Factors limiting maximal performance (22, 49, 78,
86, 102, 154) must be considered in the mechanisms

of fatigue experienced during exercise and training.
Understanding the possible limiting factors associated

Differences in Phosphocreatine Depletion and Resynthesis
in Children Versus Adults
Kappenstein and colleagues (94) tested the hypothesis that a greater oxidative capacity in children results in
lower CP depletion, faster CP resynthesis, and lower metabolic acidosis than in adults during high-intensity
intermittent exercise. Sixteen children (mean age = 9 years) and 16 adults (mean age = 26 years) completed
10 bouts of 30-second dynamic, plantar flexion contractions at 25% of 1-repetition maximum (1RM). Creatine
phosphate, ATF inorganic phosphate (P.), and phosphomonoesters were measured during and after exercise.
Creatine phosphate breakdown was significantly lower in children during the first exercise bout, and average
CP levels were higher in children at the end of exercise and during the recovery periods. In addition, muscle
pH was significantly higher in children at the end of exercise. The results suggested that children are better
able to meet energy demands with oxidative metabolism during high-intensity intermittent exercise.


Bioenergetics of Exercise and Training

with a particular athletic event is required when one is
designing training programs and attempting to delay
fatigue and possibly enhance performance. Table 3.4
depicts examples of various limiting factors based on
depletion of energy sources and increases in muscle
hydrogen ions, although other potential factors have
been postulated.
Glycogen depletion can be a limiting factor both
for long-duration, low-intensity exercise supported
primarily by aerobic metabolism and for repeated,
high-intensity exercise supported primarily by anaerobic mechanisms. Of importance to resistance training,
sprinting, and other primarily anaerobic activities is the
effect of metabolic acidosis on limiting contractile force
(53, 78, 114, 115, 123). Several other factors have been
implicated in the development of muscle fatigue and
may limit exercise performance, including increased
intracellular inorganic phosphate, ammonia accumulation, increased ADP, and impaired calcium release from

oxygen uptake increases for the first few minutes until
a steady state of uptake (oxygen demand equals oxygen
consumption) is reached (figure 3.9) (7, 83).
At the start of an exercise bout, however, some ofthe
energy must be supplied through anaerobic mechanisms
because the aerobic system responds slowly to the initial increase in the demand for energy (62, 153). This
anaerobic contribution to the total energy cost of exercise
is termed the oxygen deficit (83, 107). After exercise,
oxygen uptake remains above preexercise levels for a
period oftime that varies according to the intensity and
length of the exercise. Postexercise oxygen uptake has
been termed the oxygen debt (83, 107), recovery O,
(107), or the excess postexercise oxygen consumption

(EPOC) (22). The EPOC is the oxygen uptake above
resting values used to restore the body to the preexercise
condition (139). Only small to moderate relationships
between the oxygen deficit and the EPOC have been
observed (13, 77); the oxygen deficit may influence the
size of the EPOC, but the two are not equal. The possible
factors affecting the EPOC are listed in the sidebar (17,

Anaerobic mechanisms provide much of the energy

Metabolic Specificity of Training
Appropriate exercise intensities and rest intervals can
permit the “selection” of specific primary energy systems during training for specific athletic events (22, 107,
155). Few sports or physical activities require maximal
sustained effort to exhaustion or near exhaustion, such

as competitive middle-distance sprints (400 m to 1,600
m). Most sports and training activities produce metabolic profiles that are very similar to those of a series of
high-intensity, constant- or near-constant-effort exercise
bouts interspersed with rest periods, such as American
football, basketball, and hockey. In this type of exercise,
the required exercise intensity (power output) that must
be met during each exercise bout is much greater than
the maximal power output that can be sustained using
aerobic energy sources alone. Increasing aerobic power
through primarily aerobic endurance training while
simultaneously compromising or neglecting anaerobic
power and anaerobic capacity training is of little benefit to athletes in these sports (82, 109). For example,
it would be of little benefit for a baseball player to run
miles during training rather than focusing on exercises
that improve anaerobic power and capacity.
The use of appropriate exercise intensities
and rest intervals allows for the “selection”
of specific primary energy systems during
training and, because this is more reflective
of the actual metabolic demands of the
sport, results in more efficient and productive regimens for specific athletic events
with various metabolic demands.

Interval Training
Interval training is a method that emphasizes bioenergetic adaptations for a more efficient energy transfer
within the metabolic pathways by using predetermined
intervals of exercise and rest periods (i.e., work-to-rest
ratios). Theoretically, properly spaced work-to-rest
intervals allow more work to be accomplished at higher

exercise intensities with the same or less fatigue than
during continuous training at the same relative intensity. An early paper by Christensen and colleagues (31)
compared the total running distance, average oxygen
uptake, and blood lactate concentration during continuous running for 5 minutes and interval running totaling
30 minutes with 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 work-to-rest ratios.
Subjects were assigned a continuous running intensity
(speed) that would result in fatigue within 5 minutes.
At that fast pace during the continuous run, the subjects
were able to complete 0.81 miles (1.30 km) before
exhaustion. Using 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 work-to-rest ratios
and the same running intensity for a total duration of 30
minutes, however, the subjects were able to complete
4.14 miles (6.66 km), 3.11 miles (5.00 km), and 2.07
miles (3.33 km), respectively, all while working aerobic
capacity in a manner similar to that in the continuous
running condition. Therefore, much more training can be
accomplished at higher intensities with interval training;
this concept has been established for over 45 years (31).
A series of short-term (two-week) interval training
studies used six sessions of four to seven 30-second
maximum cycling efforts interspaced with 4 minutes of
recovery (1:8 work-to-rest ratio). These studies demonstrated improvements in muscle oxidative potential (26,
63), muscle buffering capacity (26, 63), muscle glycogen content (25, 26), and time-trial performance (25),
as well as doubled aerobic endurance capacity (26). In
addition, a similar four-week interval training program
exhibited increases in muscle activation and total work
output (38) in trained cyclists. Thus, even the results of
recent studies support the use of interval training for
metabolic adaptations.
Few studies provide results that can be used to
generate definitive guidelines for choosing specific
work-to-rest ratios. One such study, however, reported
aerobic and anaerobic metabolic variables, total work,

and time to exhaustion differences between two different
work-to-rest ratios in elite cyclists (117). The cyclists
performed two intermittent protocols that included either
a 40:20-second or a 30:30-second work-to-rest interval
to exhaustion at a fixed work rate. The 40:20-second

of the most effective forms of exercise for improving
physical performance in athletes” (p. 314). High-intensity interval training is often discussed in terms of duty
cycles involving a high-intensity work phase followed by
a lower-intensity recovery phase. It has been suggested
that nine different HIIT variables can be manipulated
to achieve the most precise metabolic specificity (23),
including

values (VO,max, lactate concentration,

ETC). In contrast, the 30:30-second work-to-rest ratio
provided sustained but slightly lower metabolic values
for a considerably longer period of time. Another study
manipulated the work variable via intensity and duration
of the work-to-rest ratios. Wakefield and Glaister (152)
reported a greater amount of time above 95% VO,max
during running at an intensity of 105% of VO,max rather
than 115% of VO,max with a work duration of 30 seconds rather than 20 and 25 seconds (rest = 20 seconds).
When one is determining the proper work-to-rest ratio
for athletes, knowledge of the time intervals, intensity
of work, and recovery periods for each of the energy
systems is critical to maximizing the amount of work that
can be accomplished for a given exercise intensity. For
example, after a bout of maximal exercise that depletes
CP stores, the complete resynthesis of CP may take up
to 8 minutes (75), which suggests that short-duration,
high-intensity exercise requires greater work-to-rest
ratios due to the aerobic mechanisms that replete phosphagen stores (75).
In contrast, as the goals of training change to longer-duration, lower-intensity tasks, the durations of
the work intervals can be longer; this will lengthen the
rest periods and decrease the work-to-rest ratios. Table
3.6 provides some general guidelines for work-to-rest
ratios that are designed to emphasize the development
of specific energy systems based on the theoretical time
course for metabolic system involvement and substrate
recovery. However, it should be noted that more research
is necessary to provide evidence-based recommendations for optimal work-to-rest ratios.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves brief
repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise with intermittent recovery periods. High-intensity interval training
typically incorporates either running- or cycling-based
modes of exercise and is an efficient exercise regimen
for eliciting cardiopulmonary (23) and metabolic and

The authors (24) indicate, however, that the intensities
and durations of the active and recovery portions of each
duty cycle are the most important factors to consider. To
optimize HIIT training adaptations for athletes, HIIT
sessions should maximize the time spent at or near
VO,max. More specifically, the cumulative duration and
intensity of the active portions of the duty cycles should
equate to several minutes above 90% of VO,max (24).
The benefits of a HIIT protocol designed to repeatedly
elicit a very high percentage of VO,max are primarily
the result of the concurrent recruitment of large motor
units and near-maximal cardiac output (6). Thus, HIIT
provides a stimulus for both oxidative muscle fiber
adaptation and myocardial hypertrophy. Additional
HIIT adaptations include increases in VO,max, proton
buffering, glycogen content, anaerobic thresholds, time
to exhaustion, and time-trial performance. For example, Gibala and coworkers (63) reported equivalent
improvements in muscle buffering capacity and glyco-

neuromuscular (24) adaptations. In fact, Buchheit and

to six 30-second cycling sprints compared to continuous
cycling for 90 to 120 minutes at 65% of VO,peak over
six total training sessions. In addition, 750 kJ cycling
time trials decreased in both groups by 10.1% and
7.5% in the HIIT and long, slow endurance training
groups, respectively. Thus, HIT provided performance
and physiological adaptations equivalent to those of
long, slow endurance training, but in a time-efficient
manner.
The strength and conditioning professional should
consider a number of factors when designing a HIIT
program. For example, a 400 m sprinter would need a
HUT program geared toward anaerobic-based durations
and intensities more than a 2-mile (3,200 m) runner.
Other considerations for the desired training adaptations
are periodization, similar to that for resistance training,
and the number of exercise sessions per day and week.
Periodization allows for the general development of
aerobic and anaerobic systems during the preseason
with transitioning to sport-specific HIIT sessions during
the competitive season. In addition, HIIT sessions in
conjunction with other training sessions (i.e., team practices) may result in greater stress and risk for injury as a
result of overtraining. Therefore, careful consideration
is warranted in determining the appropriate number of
HIIT sessions when concurrent with other sport-related
activities.

Combination Training
Some suggest that aerobic endurance training should
be added to the training of anaerobic athletes (a process
that can be termed combination training or cross-training) to enhance recovery, because it is postulated that
recovery relies primarily on aerobic mechanisms. Several studies have demonstrated that recovery in power
output is related to endurance fitness (14, 15, 74).
Bogdanis and colleagues (14) reported relationships
in power recovery in the first 10 seconds of a cycling
sprint, the resynthesis of PCr, and endurance fitness
(VO,max). However, aerobic endurance training may
reduce anaerobic performance capabilities, particularly
for high-strength, high-power performance (80). Aerobic
endurance training has been shown to reduce anaerobic
energy production capabilities in rats (151). Additionally,
combined anaerobic and aerobic endurance training can
reduce the gain in muscle girth (36, 126), maximum
strength (36, 76, 126), and speed- and power-related
performance (44, 73).
Even though the exact mechanism for this phenomenon is not known, it has been suggested that combination
training may increase training volume to a level that
may result in overtraining in comparison to aerobic
and anaerobic training alone. Hickson and colleagues

(82) provide evidence that combination training that
includes progressive endurance running and cycling and
resistance training may produce a plateau effect and, ultimately, a decrease in strength gains. Specifically, it was
reported that heavy resistance training combined with an
endurance piogram provided significant improvements
in squat strength during the first seven weeks of the
program, followed by a plateau period (two weeks) and
then a decrease in squat strength during the remaining
weeks of the program (two weeks). The results provided evidence that the upper limits of strength may be
inhibited with progressive endurance training such as
running and cycling. Other mechanisms that have been
suggested to hinder the development of strength when in
combination with endurance training are (a) decreasing
rapid voluntary activation, (b) chronically lower muscle
glycogen levels that can limit intracellular signaling
responses during resistance training, and (c) and fiber
type transition to slow-twitch fibers (112).
On the other hand, some studies and reviews indicate
that the opposite holds true; these suggest that anaerobic training (strength training) can improve low- and
high-intensity exercise endurance (54, 81, 82, 134).
Sedano and colleagues (134) reported improvements
in performance of highly trained runners as a result
of concurrent endurance,

resistance, and plyometric

training. There was no reduction in VO,max over the
12 weeks in runners who participated in resistance and
plyometric training. Furthermore, the combination training improved performance measures such as maximal
strength, peak running velocity, and 3 km time trial
compared to endurance training alone. Thus in highly
trained runners it would appear that strength training
would improve performance while not hindering metabolic parameters (VO,max).
Although oxidative metabolism is important for
increased postexercise VO; lactate removal, and PCr restoration from heavy anaerobic exercise (e.g., resistance
training and sprint training) (133), care must be used
in prescribing aerobic endurance training for anaerobic
sports. In this context, it should be noted that specific
anaerobic training can stimulate increases in aerobic
power and enhance markers of recovery (54). Thus, it
appears that extensive aerobic endurance training to
enhance recovery from anaerobic events is not necessary and may be counterproductive in most strength and
power sports.

Conclusion
Training programs with increased productivity can be
designed through an understanding of how energy is
produced during various types of exercise and how




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

energy production can be modified by specific training
regimens. Which energy system is used to supply energy
for muscular contraction is determined primarily by the
intensity of exercise and secondarily by the duration of
exercise. Metabolic responses and training adaptations
are largely regulated by exercise characteristics (e.g.,

intensity, duration, and recovery intervals). How these

responses and adaptations occur following physical
activity forms the basis for metabolic specificity of
exercise and training. This principle allows for enhanced
athletic performance through the implementation of

improved training programs.
