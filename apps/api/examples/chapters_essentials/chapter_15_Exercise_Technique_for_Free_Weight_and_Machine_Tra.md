Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

This chapter provides guidelines and strategies for
performing and teaching safe and effective lifting and
spotting techniques. At the core of safe and effective
resistance training is proper exercise execution. Exercises that are performed and spotted correctly promote
injury-free results and do so in a time-efficient manner.
The first half of this chapter summarizes the fundamental techniques involved in properly performing
and spotting exercises and using a weight belt during
lifting. The last section provides checklists and photographs depicting proper resistance training exercise
and spotting techniques. It is assumed that the reader is
familiar with these exercises. Therefore, the techniques
presented are simply guidelines that represent the most
commonly accepted method of performing the exercises.
No attempt has been made to describe all variations for
properly executing and spotting the exercises included
in this chapter.

Fundamentals
of Exercise Technique
There are several commonalities among resistance
training exercise techniques. Most free weight and
machine exercises involve some sort of handgrip on a
bar, dumbbell, or handle; and absolutely all exercises

require an optimal body or limb position, movement
range and speed, and method of breathing. Additionally,
some exercises may also warrant the use of a weight
belt and certain procedures for lifting a bar off the floor.

Handgrips
Two common grips are used in resistance training
exercises: (a) the pronated grip, with palms down and
knuckles up, also called the overhand grip; and (b) the
supinated grip, with palms up and knuckles down, also
known as the underhand grip (figure 15.1). (A variation
of either grip is the neutral grip, in which the knuckles
point laterally—as in a handshake.) Two less common
grips are the alternated grip, in which one hand is ina
pronated grip and the other is in a supinated grip, and the
hook grip, which is similar to the pronated grip except
that the thumb is positioned under the index and middle
fingers. The hook grip is typically used for performing
exercises that require a stronger grip (power exercises,
e.g., snatch). Note that the thumb is wrapped around the
bar in all of the grips shown; this positioning is called a
closed grip. When the thumb does not wrap around the
bar, the grip is called an open or false grip.
Establishing the proper grip in an exercise involves
placing the hands at the correct distance from each other
(referred to as the grip width), from the center of the
bar (i.e., to maintain balance). The three grip widths

FIGURE 15.1 Bar grips: (a) pronated, (b) supinated,
alternated, and (d) hook (posterior view).

(c)

(shown in figure 15.2) are common, wide, and narrow.
For most exercises, the hands are placed approximately
shoulder-width apart. The hand positioning for all
exercises should result in a balanced, even bar. Weightlifting exercises and their variations use two types of
grips: (a) the clean grip or (b) the snatch grip. Both
of these grips are pronated closed hand positions. The
clean grip is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart,
outside of the knees. The snatch grip is a wide grip and
can be determined using two types of measurements:
the fist-to-opposite-shoulder method and the elbow-toelbow method (also known as the scarecrow method).
Both the clean grip and the snatch grip are often used
with a hook grip (mentioned previously) to assist in
giving the athlete a stronger grip.

Stable Body and Limb Positioning
Whether an exercise requires lifting a barbell or dumbbell from the floor or pushing and pulling while one
is positioned in or on a machine, establishing a stable
position is critical for safety and optimal performance.
A stable position enables the athlete to maintain proper

body alignment during an exercise, which in turn places
an appropriate stress on muscles and joints.
Exercises performed during standing typically require
that the feet be positioned slightly wider than hip-width
with the heels and balls of the feet in contact with the
floor. Establishing a stable position in or on machines
sometimes requires adjusting the seat or resistance arm
and fastening belts snugly.
Seated or supine (lying face up) exercises performed
ona bench require a specific posture. The athlete should
position the body to achieve a five-point body contact
position:
1. Head is placed firmly on the bench or back pad.
2. Shoulders and upper back are placed firmly and
evenly on the bench or back pad.
3. Buttocks are placed evenly on the bench or seat.
4. Right foot is flat on the floor.

5. Left foot is flat on the floor.
Establishing and maintaining this five-point body
contact position at the beginning and throughout the
movement phases promotes maximal stability and spinal
support (2, 9, 10).
Exercises performed during standing typically require that the feet be positioned
slightly wider than hip-width with the heels
and balls of the feet in contact with the floor.
Seated or supine exercises performed on
a bench usually require a five-point body
contact position.

Cam-, pulley-, or lever-based exercise machines that
have an axis of rotation require specific positioning of
the athlete’s body, arms, or legs for reasons of safety
and optimal execution. To align the primary joint of
the body involved in the exercise with the axis of the
machine, it may be necessary to move the seat; the ankle

or arm roller pad; or the thigh, chest, or back pad. For
example, adjust the ankle roller pad (up or down) and
the back pad (forward or backward) to line up the knee
joint with the machine axis before performing the leg
(knee) extension exercise.

Range of Motion and Speed
When the entire range of motion (ROM) is covered
during an exercise, the value of the exercise is maxi-

mized and flexibility is maintained or improved. Ideally,
an exercise’s full ROM should mimic the full ROM
of the involved joint or joints in order for the greatest

Training

Repetitions performed in a slow, controlled manner
increase the likelihood that full ROM can be reached.
However, when power or quick-lift exercises (e.g.,
power clean, push jerk, and snatch) are performed, an
effort should be made to accelerate the bar to a maximal
speed while still maintaining control and proper form
throughout the exercise.

Breathing Considerations
The most strenuous movement of a repetition—typically soon after the transition from the eccentric phase
to the concentric phase—is referred to as the sticking
point. Strength and conditioning professionals should
typically instruct athletes to exhale through the sticking
point and to inhale during the less stressful phase of
the repetition (3, 6, 7). For example, since the sticking
point of the biceps curl exercise occurs about midway
through the upward movement phase (concentric elbow
flexion), the athlete should exhale during this portion.
Inhalation, then, should occur as the bar is lowered back

to the starting position. This breathing strategy applies
to most resistance training exercises.
There are some situations in which breath holding
may be suggested, however. For experienced resistance-trained athletes performing structural exercises
(those that load the vertebral column and therefore place
stress on it) with high loads, the Valsalva maneuver can
be helpful for maintaining proper vertebral alignment
and support. As explained in chapter 2, the Valsalva
maneuver involves expiring against a closed glottis,
which, when combined with contracting the abdomen
and rib cage muscles, creates rigid compartments of
fluid in the lower torso and air in the upper torso (1.e.,
the “fluid ball”). The advantage of the Valsalva maneuver is that it increases the rigidity of the entire torso to
aid in supporting the vertebral column, which in turn
reduces the associated compressive forces on the disks
during lifting (1, 4, 5, 8). It also helps to establish and
maintain a normal lordotic lumbar spine position (also
called a neutral spine) and erect upper torso position,
described in the technique checklists for certain exercises. Be aware, however, that the resulting increase in
intra-abdominal pressure has potentially detrimental side
effects, such as dizziness, disorientation, excessively
high blood pressure, and blackouts. This is why the
breath-holding phase is—and should be—quite transient, only about | to 2 seconds (at most). Even a very
well-trained individual should not extend the length of
the breath-holding phase, as blood pressure can quickly

rise to triple resting levels (7).
Strength and conditioning professionals involved

in conducting

advantages and disadvantages of coaching athletes in
the Valsalva maneuver. While it is obviously important
that the vertebral column be internally supported during
these movements for safety and technique reasons, it
is recommended that an athlete not extend the breathholding period.
For most exercises, exhale through the sticking point of the concentric phase and inhale
during the eccentric phase. Experienced
and well-trained athletes may want to use
the Valsalva maneuver when performing
structural exercises to assist in maintaining
proper vertebral alignment and support (6).

Weight Belts
The use of a weight belt may help maintain intra-abdominal pressure during lifting (5, 7). Its appropriateness depends on the type of exercise performed and the
relative load lifted. It is recommended that a weight belt
be worn for exercises that place stress on the lower back
and during sets that use near-maximal or maximal loads.
Adopting this strategy may reduce the risk of lower back
injury when combined with proper lifting and spotting
techniques. A drawback to weight belt use is that wearing
a belt too often reduces opportunities for the abdominal
muscles to be trained. Furthermore, no weight belt is
needed for exercises that do not stress the lower back
(e.g., biceps curl, lat pulldown), or for exercises that do
stress the lower back (e.g., back squat or deadlift) but
involve the use of light loads.
Typically an athlete should wear a weight
belt when performing exercises that place
stress on the lower back and during sets that
involve near-maximal or maximal loads. A
weight belt is not needed for exercises that
do not stress the lower back or for those
that do stress the lower back but involve
light loads.

Spotting Free Weight Exercises
A spotter is someone who assists in the execution of
an exercise to help protect the athlete from injury. A
spotter may also serve to motivate the athlete and help
in the completion of forced repetitions (also referred
to as partner-assisted reps), but the spotter’s primary
responsibility is the safety of the athlete being spotted.
The spotter must realize that poor execution of this
responsibility may result in serious injury, not only to
the athlete being spotted, but also to the spotter and other
individuals in close proximity. Although partner-assisted
actions are valuable in helping an athlete benefit from

training, the importance of promoting safety cannot be
overemphasized.
The remainder of this section offers additional insight
on when and how to spot free weight exercises. This
information provides a foundation for strength and
conditioning professionals to apply to their specific
training environment.

Types of Exercises Performed
and Equipment Involved
Free weight exercises performed over the head (e.g.,
barbell shoulder press) or with the bar on the back (e.g.,
back squat), racked anteriorly on the shoulders or on the
clavicles (e.g., front squat) or over the face (e.g., bench
press, lying triceps extension), are more challenging
for the athlete to correctly execute than those in which
the bar or dumbbells are held or raised at the sides or in
front (e.g., lateral shoulder raise or barbell biceps curl,
respectively) and therefore should involve one or more
spotters. The overhead, bar-on-the-back or bar-on-thefront-shoulders and over-the-face exercises (especially
using dumbbells) also require more skill on the part of
the spotter and are potentially the most dangerous to the
athlete. Spotting dumbbell exercises typically requires
more skill than spotting barbell exercises because there
is an additional piece of equipment to observe and spot.
Power exercises should not be spotted.
With the exception of power exercises, free
weight exercises performed with a bar
moving over the head, positioned on the
back, racked on the front of the shoulders,
or passing over the face typically require one
or more spotters.

Spotting Overhead Exercises and Those With
the Bar on the Back or Front Shoulders
Ideally, to promote the safety of the athlete, the spotters, and others nearby, overhead exercises and those
involving the bar on the back or front shoulders should

be performed inside a power rack with the crossbars in
place at an appropriate height. All plates, bars, locks, and
weight-plate trees must be cleared from the lifting area
so they cannot be tripped over or run into and cannot
affect the movement of the bar. Athletes who are not
lifting should be instructed to stay clear of the lifting
area. Since the loads lifted in these exercises can be
considerable, to exert sufficient leverage the spotter or
spotters should be at least as strong and at least as tall
as the athlete who is lifting. Out-of-the-rack exercises
(e.g., forward step lunge or step-up) with heavy weights
can result in serious injury. These exercises should be
executed only by well-trained and skilled athletes and
spotted by experienced professionals.


Exercise Technique for Free Weight and Machine Training

Spotting Over-the-Face Exercises
When spotting over-the-face barbell exercises, it is
important for the spotter to grasp the bar with an alternated grip, usually narrower than the athlete’s grip.
Because of the bar’s curved trajectory in some exercises (e.g., lying triceps extension, barbell pullover),
the spotter will use an alternated grip to pick up the bar
and return it to the floor but a supinated grip to spot the
bar. This helps ensure that the bar does not roll out of
the spotter’s hands and onto the athlete’s face or neck.
Since the spotter may be called upon to catch the bar or
assist in lifting moderate to heavy loads (usually from
a higher vantage point), establishing a solid, wide base
of support with the feet and a neutral spine position is
critically important.
For dumbbell exercises, it is important to spot as
close to the dumbbells as possible or, in a few exercises,
to spot the dumbbell itself. Although some individuals
advocate spotting dumbbell movements by placing the
hands on the athlete’s upper arms or elbows (figure
15.3a), this technique may lead to injury. If the athlete’s
elbows “collapse” (i.e., flex), the spotter will not be
in a position to stop the dumbbells from striking the
athlete’s face or chest. Spotting at the forearms near the
wrists (figure 15.35) is a safer technique. Note that for
some exercises (e.g., dumbbell pullover and overhead
dumbbell triceps extension), it is necessary to spot with
hands on the dumbbell itself.

Do Not Spot Power Exercises
Whereas spotting is recommended in the types of
exercises previously described, it is not advised in

FIGURE 15.3.

power exercises. Instead of spotting these exercises, the
strength and conditioning professional needs to teach
athletes how to get away from a bar that is unmanageable. Spotting these types of exercises is too dangerous to
both the spotter and athlete. Athletes should be instructed
that when they miss the bar in front, they should push the
bar away or simply drop it. They should be taught that
if they lose the bar behind the head, they should release

it and jump forward. For these reasons, the surrounding
area or platform should be cleared of other athletes and
equipment before such exercises are performed.

Number of Spotters
The number of spotters needed is largely determined
by the load being lifted, the experience and ability of
the athlete and spotters, and the physical strength of the
spotters. With heavier loads, the likelihood and severity
of an injury increase. Once the load exceeds the spotter’s
ability to effectively protect the athlete (and him- or
herself), another spotter must become involved. On
the other hand, one spotter is preferred if he or she can
easily handle the load, because two or more spotters must
coordinate their actions with those ofthe athlete. As the
number of spotters increases, so does the chance that an
error in timing or technique may occur.

Communication Between Athlete

and Spotter
Communication is the responsibility of both the spotter
and the athlete. Before beginning a set, the athlete should
tell the spotter how the bar will initially be handled, how
many repetitions will be performed, and when he or

she is ready to move the bar into position. If spotters do
not have this information they may take control of the
bar improperly, too soon, or too late and consequently
disrupt the exercise or injure the athlete.

Use of a Liftoff
The term liftoff refers to moving the bar from the upright
supports to a position in which the athlete can begin the
exercise. Usually the spotter helps place the barbell or
dumbbells into the athlete’s hands while the elbows are
extended and helps to move the barbell or dumbbells
to the proper starting position. Some athletes may want
the spotter to provide a liftoff; others do not. Ifa liftoff
is needed or requested, the athlete and spotter need to
agree in advance on a verbal signal (e.g., the command
“up” or “I will give it to you on the count of three”).
Typically, the athlete signals that he or she is ready; the
spotter says, “One, two, three,” and on “three” the bar

is moved into position. Liftoffs are normally used in the
bench press (off the supports), shoulder press (off the
supports or the shoulders), and squatting exercises if
the supports are too low and nonadjustable. When two
spotters are involved and the athlete wants a liftoff, as
with a bench press, one spotter should assist with the

liftoff and then quickly move to the end of the bar to
spot (the other spotter is already at the other end). The
spotter providing the liftoff must be sure that the athlete
has complete control of the bar at the conclusion of the
liftoff. If two spotters are used, both should help the athlete place the bar back onto the supports on completion
of the exercise.

Amount and Timing of Spotting Assistance
Knowing how much and when to help an athlete is an
important aspect of spotting, and it requires the spotter
to be experienced in proper spotting techniques. Most
athletes typically need just enough help to successfully
complete a repetition through a sticking point (i.e., a
partner-assisted action); other times they might need the
spotter to handle the entire load. At the first indication
that a repetition will be missed, the athlete should quickly
ask or signal the spotter (sometimes with just a grunt or
sound) for help, and the spotter needs to immediately
attempt to provide the amount of assistance needed. If
the athlete cannot contribute anything to the completion
of the repetition, the athlete should immediately tell the
spotter to “take it” or use some other phrase agreed upon
before the lift. Regardless of when or why the spotter

Guidelines for Spotting
Certain exercises that require spotting (over the face-neck and on the back) have a higher level of difficulty
and thus warrant additional safety considerations. In any exercise where the potential for injury might occur,
spotting should be used.
Spotting is necessary on skillful multijoint exercises that involve a barbell or dumbbells being lifted over
the head, on the back, on the front of the shoulders, or over the face.

Exercises done overhead and with a bar racked on the back or in front of the shoulders may require more
than one spotter, and multiple spotters must be taught how and where to spot the exercise.
Spotting over-the-face exercises requires the spotter to grasp the implement being lifted or the athlete's
wrists. Spotters must be trained to grasp the implement properly and even assist athletes in reracking
the bar or returning dumbbells to the start position in case an exercise becomes too difficult to complete
safely on their own.
Power exercises are not spotted due to the safety factors for the athlete and the spotter(s), and athletes
should be taught “how to miss” properly when learning these exercises.
.

Determining the number of spotters for certain exercises depends on a number of factors, especially
the amount of load being used, because the likelihood of injury can increase greatly with heavier loads.
Both spotters and athletes must communicate properly before beginning an exercise requiring increased
safety. They both must take part in this communication and be clear as to what exercise is being per
formed and how many repetitions. Therefore, communicating on exercises that require a liftoff is critical
to safety in these exercises.

The liftoff requires a spotter to assist the athlete in getting the implement(s) to the proper position before
beginning the exercise and can require multiple spotters, depending on the exercise.
The spotting guidelines provided in this chapter should be a fundamental part of any strength and conditioning professional's training. Safety of athletes in the weight room is the most important part of supervising
and conducting proper training programs and providing the best and safest atmosphere for athletes to be
successful in training.


Exercise Technique for Free Weight and Machine Training

is needed to assist, he or she should take the bar—if

possible—from the athlete quickly and smoothly, trying
to avoid abrupt changes in the amount of load being
handled by the athlete. The athlete should try to stay with
the bar until it is racked or placed safely on the floor.
This helps to protect both the spotter and athlete from
injury.
The spotting guidelines provided in the exercise
technique checklists are appropriate for a typical training environment. Spotting procedures may vary when
excessively heavy loads are being used—such as 1RM
attempts—because more spotters are typically needed.

Conclusion
It is critically important that the strength and conditioning professional provide athletes with proper instruction
in resistance training exercise technique, including the
fundamentals of breathing and weight belt use. In addition, the strength and conditioning professional needs to
teach athletes how and when exercises should be spotted.
Combined with quality supervision and ongoing feedback, this attention to proper instruction results in a safe
training environment and an effective and appropriate
training stimulus.

This exercise can also be performed with two dumbbells, using a closed, neutral grip. The athlete allows
the dumbbells to hang at arm's length alongside the
body throughout the exercise. When using dumbbells,
the spotter assists the athlete in the same manner
as in the barbell version, although the task of helping
the athlete rack the bar is not applicable. (Note: This
exercise cannot be performed inside a typical power
rack. The use of a tiered squat rack or a power rack
that has supports on the outside is recommended.
To allow an optimal view of the exercise technique, a
rack is not shown in the photos.)

Starting Position: Athlete
Step under the bar and position the feet parallel
to each other.

Grasp the bar with a closed, pronated grip.
Place the bar in a balanced position on the upper
back and shoulders above the posterior deltoids
at the base of the neck (using a handgrip only
slightly wider than shoulderwidth).
Lift the elbows up to create a “shelf” for the
bar using the upper back and shoulder muscles.

Power Exercises

($15.37 PUSH PRESS
This exercise consists of quickly and forcefully pushing the bar from the shoulders to over the head.
Although the ascent consists of two phases, the
upward movement of the bar occurs in one continuous motion without interruption. Both the push
press and the push jerk exercises involve a rapid hip
and knee extension that accelerates the bar off the
shoulders, followed immediately by movements that
position the bar overhead. The technique used to
attain this final bar position varies, however. In the
push press, the hip and knee extension thrust is only
forceful enough to drive the bar one-half to two-thirds
the distance overhead. From this height, the bar is
“pressed out” to the overhead position, with the hips
and knees remaining fully extended after the thrust.
For either exercise, the athlete can begin with a bar
taken from shoulderheight supports outside a power
rack or by lifting a bar from the floor to the shoulders
(via a repetition of the power clean exercise). Both
exercises may be performed behind the neck using
either a clean grip or a snatch grip. The following
checklists describe the exercises using a power rack
(although the rack is not shown).

Starting Position
e Grasp the bar with a closed, pronated grip.
¢ Grip should be slightly wider than shoulderwidth
(clean grip).
e Step under the bar and position the feet hip-width
apart and parallel to each other.
e Move up to the bar to place it on top of the
anterior deltoids and clavicles.
e Extend the hips and knees to lift the bar off the
supports.


Preparation Phase: Dip
e Flex the hips and knees at a controlled speed to
move the bar in a straight path downward.
¢ Continue the dip to a depth not to exceed a
quarter squat, the catch position of the power
clean, or 10% of the athlete's height.
e Keep the feet flat on the floor, the torso erect,
and the elbows underneath or slightly ahead of
the bar.

Upward Movement Phase: Drive
¢ Immediately upon reaching the lowest position
of the dip, reverse the movement by forcefully
and quickly extending the hips, knees, and ankles
and then the elbows to move the bar overhead.

Catch (for the Push Press)
e After the hips and knees are fully extended and
the bar is overhead from the drive phase, press
it up the rest of the way until the elbows are
fully extended.
e |n this position the torso is erect, the head is in
a neutral position, the feet are flat on the floor,
and the bar is slightly over or behind the ears.

Downward Movement Phase
e Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular
tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent
of the bar to the shoulders.
¢ Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the shoulders.
e At the end of the set, step toward the rack and
place the bar in the supports.

e Step back away from the supports and stand in
the middle of the lifting platform.

PUSH JERK

The push jerk involves a more forceful hip and knee
thrust so that the bar is actually “driven” upward and
caught with extended elbows in the overhead position
with the hips and knees slightly flexed.

Starting Position
e Grasp the bar with a closed, pronated grip.
e Grip should be slightly wider than shoulderwidth
(clean grip).

e Step under the bar and position the feet hip- to
shoulderwidth apart and parallel to each other.
e Move close to the bar so that it is resting on the
anterior deltoids and clavicles.
e Extend the hips and knees to lift the bar out of
the supports.
Step back away from the supports and stand in
the middle of the lifting platform.
Position the feet hip-width apart or slightly wider
with toes pointed straight ahead or slightly
outward.

e All repetitions begin from this position.

Preparation Phase: Dip
e Flex the hips and knees at a controlled speed to
move the bar in a straight path downward.
e Continue the dip to a depth not to exceed a
quarter squat.

Catch (for the Push Jerk)
e After the hips and knees are fully extended and
the bar is being driven overhead, quickly flex the
hips and knees to a dipped position while simultaneously fully extending the elbows so that the
bar is received overhead at the same moment
that the bar reaches its highest position.
Catch the bar with the torso erect, the head in
neutral position, feet flat on the floor, and the bar
slightly behind the head, forming a straight line
through the body.

Recovery Phase
e After gaining control and balance, stand up by
extending the hips and knees to a fully erect
position with the feet flat on the floor.
e Keep the elbows locked while the bar is stabilized
overhead.

Downward Movement Phase
e Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular
tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent
of the bar to the shoulders.
¢ Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the shoulders.
e At the end of the set, step toward the rack and
place the bar in the supports.

¢ Keep the feet flat on the floor, the torso erect,
and the elbows underneath or slightly ahead of
the bar.

Upward Movement Phase: Drive
e Immediately upon reaching the lowest position of
the dip, reverse the movement by forcefully and
quickly extending the hips, knees, and ankles,
and then the elbows to move the bar overhead.

four phases, the upward movement of the bar occurs
in one continuous motion without interruption. The
hang power clean is similar to the power clean exer
cise, except that the bar begins positioned at midthigh
or slightly below or above the knees. In this variant of
the power clean, the bar does not start on the floor
or return to the floor between repetitions.

Upward Movement Phase: First Pull
e Lift the bar off the floor by forcefully extending
the hips and knees.
¢

Keep the torso-to-floor angle constant; do not let
the hips rise before the shoulders.

e Maintain the neutral spine position.

¢ Keep the elbows fully extended, pointing out
to the side, and the shoulders over or slightly
ahead of the bar.

e As the bar is raised, keep it as close to the shins
as possible.

Upward Movement Phase: Catch
e After the lower body has fully extended, pull the
body under the bar and rotate the hands around
and under the bar.

Upward Movement Phase: Transition
e As the bar rises just above the knees, thrust the
hips forward and slightly flex the knees to move
the thighs against, and the knees under, the bar.

Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees
quartersquat position.

Once the body is under the bar, catch the bar
over and slightly behind the ears with
— fully extended elbows,
— anerect and stable torso,
— aneutral head position,
— flat feet, and
— the body's weight over the middle of the
feet.

Keep the back neutral or slightly arched and the
elbows fully extended and pointing out to the
sides.
Note: The transition phase is similar to the Romanian deadlift; in fact, weightlifters use the RDL to
strengthen this movement pattern.

Upward Movement Phase: Second Pull

After gaining control and balance, stand up by
extending the hips and knees to a fully erect
position.

Rapidly extend the hips, knees, and ankles.
(Note: It is important that the heels stay in contact with the floor for as long as possible in order
to maximize force transference to the barbell.)

e

Keep the bar as close to the body as possible.

Stabilize the bar overhead.

Downward Movement Phase

Keep the back neutral and the elbows pointing
out to the sides.

e

Keep the shoulders over the bar and the elbows
extended as long as possible.
When the lower body joints reach full extension, rapidly shrug the shoulders upward with
the elbows still fully extended and out to the
sides.

Lower the bar from the overhead position by
gradually reducing the muscular tension of the
shoulders to allow a controlled descent of the
bar to the thighs.

Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.

Squat down with the elbows fully extended until
the bar touches the floor or drop the bar to the
platform if rubber bumper plates are being used.

e As the shoulders reach their highest elevation,
flex the elbows to begin pulling the body under
the bar.

MAJOR MUSCLES INVOLVED

e Due to the explosive nature of this phase, the
torso is erect or slightly hyperextended, the
head is tilted slightly back, and the feet may lose
contact with the floor.
