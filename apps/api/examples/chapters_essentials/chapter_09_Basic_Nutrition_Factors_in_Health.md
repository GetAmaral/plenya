Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Good nutrition provides athletes with the nutrients
necessary for general health, growth, development,
and repairing and building muscle tissue, as well as the
energy needed to train, compete, and maintain mental
focus and concentration. A nutrition plan that is tailored
to an athlete’s specific needs can help decrease risk of
injuries and illness and maximize training adaptations
(improvements made from training) while helping the
athlete reach his or her performance goals. This chapter
focuses on the scientific rationale for performanceenhancing nutrition practices while providing suggestions that will help readers apply sports nutrition science
to real-life scenarios.
Given the amount of nutrition misinformation and
conflicting nutrition advice circulating on the Internet,
in print, and via word of mouth, nutrition can be very
confusing for athletes (185). In addition, each athlete’s
dietary needs differ from those of age- and sex-matched
sedentary counterparts because of the physiological
demands of his or her sport. Nutrition guidelines created
for the general public are not necessarily applicable to
athletes. Because each athlete’s nutrition needs depend
on many factors (age; body size and composition; sex;
genetics; environmental training conditions; injuries;
medical nutrition needs; and duration, frequency, and
intensity of training), nutrition requirements can vary

tremendously between athletes, even if they play the
same position. And finally, because nutrition is a complex, constantly evolving science, it is important for
strength and conditioning professionals to have some
basic nutrition knowledge in addition to a list of nutrition
professionals they can refer athletes to for individualized
nutrition advice based on the latest science.

Role of Sports Nutrition
Professionals
Sports nutrition is a complex multidisciplinary field, and
athletic trainers, strength and conditioning professionals,
physicians, exercise scientists, and food service providers have varying degrees of nutrition knowledge. Job
responsibilities of player development staff should be
outlined based on the nutrition education and knowledge
of the staff member, the type of nutrition information
provided, and state licensure laws regarding nutrition
practice.
All sports nutrition professionals should be able to
answer basic nutrition questions (for example, “What
are some healthy snack ideas?”). However, athletes
with complex nutrition issues should be referred to the
appropriate resource, either a team physician or sports
dietitian. The team physician is responsible for overseeing the athlete’s medical care while the sports dietitian

is responsible for providing individualized dietary
advice. A sports dietitian is a registered dietitian (also
referred to as a registered dietitian nutritionist) with
specific education and experience in sports nutrition.
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) Board
Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics (CSSD) certification distinguishes registered dietitians with expertise
in sports nutrition from other registered dietitians who
specialize in other areas of nutrition (see the sidebar
on this topic). And though some sports dietitians have
complementary skills or training and may therefore be
social workers, athletic trainers, or chefs, a comprehensive sports nutrition program requires full-time attention;
therefore these secondary skills should be considered a
complement to the sports dietitian’s knowledge rather
than be used to try to fill two distinct job positions with
one individual. And finally, higher-level positions generally a sports dietitian with a master’s degree or PhD.
A sports dietitian can help athletes make the connection
between plate and performance.
At times, physicians and sports dietitians may work
together to help athletes with eating disorders, nutrient
deficiencies, or specific disease states such as diabetes.
Because an athlete’s nutrition and medical information
may be shared with other members of the player development or coaching staff or family members in order
to provide comprehensive care, in the United States all
staff should follow Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines for handling an
athlete’s protected health information.
A sports nutrition coach is a professional who is not a
registered dietitian but has basic training in nutrition and
exercise science. For example, the strength and conditioning professional can act as a sports nutrition coach,
providing basic nutrition education and suggestions.
More complex situations in which food or nutrition is
being used to treat or manage a medical condition (that
includes a nutrient deficiency) require medical nutrition
therapy and fall under the role of the sports dietitian.
Sports nutrition coaches may obtain additional education
by getting a sports nutrition certification. For example,
the American Council on Exercise (ACE) has a Fitness
Nutrition Specialist certification designed for personal
trainers, health coaches, group fitness instructors, and
health care professionals. Also, the International Society
of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) Sports Nutrition Specialist
Certification requires a high school diploma for the
exam and is geared toward personal trainers or other
fitness professionals who do not hold a four-year college
degree. The ISSN also has a Certified Sports Nutritionist
credential (CISSN), which requires a four-year undergraduate degree (or current status as a student majoring
in exercise science, nutrition, or a related field) and is



Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics (CSSD)
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a CSSD does the following (these competencies are
also what strength and conditioning professionals should look for in a sports dietitian):

Counsels individuals and groups on daily nutrition for performance and health
Translates the latest scientific evidence into practical sports nutrition recommendations

Tracks and documents outcomes of nutrition services, serving as a food and nutrition resource for
coaches, trainers, and parents

Assesses and analyzes dietary practices, body composition, and energy balance (intake and expenditure)
of athletes in the context of athletic performance and health
Counsels athletes on optimal nutrition for exercise training (match nutrition to training phases and goals),
competition, recovery from exercise, weight management, hydration, immune health, disordered eating,
travel, and supplementation
Counsels athletes on achieving and maintaining a level of body mass, body fat, and muscle mass that
is consistent with good health and good performance
Provides personalized meal and snack plans to promote achieving short- and long-term goals for athletic
performance and good health
Develops hydration protocols that help athletes meet their own specific fluid and electrolyte needs

Addresses nutritional challenges to performance, such as food allergies, bone mineral disturbances,
gastrointestinal disturbances, iron depletion, and iron-deficiency anemia
Provides medical nutrition therapy, as needed, to help manage or treat medical conditions, which may
include diabetes, irritable bowel disease, hypertension, and more
Counsels athletes on optimal nutrition for recovery from illness or injury
Coordinates nutritional care as a member of multidisciplinary sports medical/sports science teams
Is a liaison to in- and out-patient programs for conditions such as disordered eating
Evaluates nutritional supplements, including herbal and sports supplements, for legality, safety, quality,
and efficacy; monitors use of appropriate supplementation
Collaborates with the individual's family, physician, coach, and other health professionals as appropriate
while also following HIPAA guidelines

Develops resources to support educational efforts
Educates athletes and teams on food selection (grocery store tours) food storage, and food preparation
(cooking classes)

Documents nutrition services provided and evaluates the effectiveness of nutrition strategies towards
meeting desired outcomes using the Nutrition Care Process

intended for health, fitness, and medical professionals

who work with athletes and active individuals.
A sports nutritionist with an advanced degree is a professional who may work in the sports nutrition industry
or conduct research in the area of sports nutrition and
would therefore be able to discuss the literature on a
particular topic. The sports nutritionist with an advanced
degree may also choose to obtain a sports nutrition certification. One option is the IOC (International Olympic
Committee) Diploma in Sports Nutrition. This two-year
program includes coursework, seminars, tutorials, and

laboratory practical work. The IOC states that students
interested in this course typically have a degree in
nutrition or dietetics, biological sciences (including
biochemistry, physiology, or sport science), or medicine.

All sports nutrition professionals must follow state
nutrition licensure laws, which vary from state to state
and specify who is allowed to provide individualized
nutrition counseling and medical nutrition therapy. For
instance, in Louisiana, general nutrition education can
be provided by various disciplines if the information is
general, accurate, and not individualized (based on a spe-

cific person’s dietary needs). However, only a licensed
dietitian or nutritionist can provide nutrition assessment
and counseling. Nutrition counseling is defined as “the
provision of the individual guidance on appropriate food
and nutrient intake for those with special needs, taking
into consideration

health, cultural, socioeconomic,

functional, and psychological facts from the nutrition
assessment. Nutrition counseling may include advice to



Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

increase or decrease nutrients in the diet; to change the
timing and size of and composition of meals; to modify
food textures, and in extreme instances, to change the
route of administration” (www.I|bedn.org).
Many individuals without any (or with minimal) education in nutrition and exercise science and little to no
formal training refer to themselves as sports nutritionists.
Regardless of the specific title of the person providing
sports nutrition information or individualized dietary
advice, strength and conditioning professionals should
take a close look at the person’s education (including
the curriculum), previous work history (especially the
person’s day-to-day job duties), knowledge of sports
nutrition, and years of experience.
Experienced sports dietitians help athletes
make the connection between plate and performance. They have advanced knowledge,
skills, and expertise in sports nutrition.

The first step in nutrition coaching involves defining
the athlete’s goals and identifying the coach’s goals
(since the two may be different). After this, similar to
the strength and conditioning professional undertaking
a needs analysis, the sports dietitian will take a detailed
look at the athlete’s diet, individual food preferences
(including cultural and religious considerations), cooking skills, access to food, financial constraints, barriers

to making wise dietary choices, supplement use, weight
and body composition history, medical history, training
program, and injuries. The sports dietitian will then
work with the athlete to develop a plan that fits his or
her lifestyle and taste preferences while including (1) the
appropriate calorie level; (2) macronutrients and micronutrients in recommended amounts; (3) adequate fluids
and electrolytes; and (4) supplements as necessary to
help correct a nutrient deficiency, make up for potential
nutrient shortfalls, or meet training goals.

Standard Nutrition Guidelines
For general nutrition information, strength and conditioning professionals may want to refer their athletes to
MyPlate, a food guidance system created by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and based on the 2010 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans to help consumers make better
food choices (98). MyPlate is an icon offive food groups
based on a mealtime visual, the place setting (figure 9.1).

MyPlate
Information related to MyPlate can be found at www
.choosemyplate.gov. Although the basic guidelines
represented by the MyPlate icon and corresponding
educational materials are universal, they include calorie

guidelines and portion recommendations for fruit, grains,
and protein and an allowance for oil based on age and
sex for individuals who get less than 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days, as noted in tables 9.1
and 9.2. Those who are more physically active should
adjust the guidelines to meet their specific dietary needs
(136). And though oils are not a food group, they contain
nutrients such as essential fatty acids and vitamin E.
Therefore, a daily allowance is provided for oils.
MyPlate should be considered a starting point that
athletes can use to evaluate their diet. In general, if a
diet provides a variety of foods from each group, it
is more likely to contain an adequate amount of each
vitamin and mineral. However, if the diet excludes an

entire food group, specific nutrients may be lacking.
For example, an athlete who excludes dairy from the
diet may have a tough time meeting his or her nutrition
requirements for calcium, potassium, and vitamin D
(in fortified milk and fortified yogurts). Even though
calcium-fortified nondairy replacement foods may help
people meet their calcium needs, they are not a nutritionally equivalent substitute for dairy and may therefore be
lacking in other nutrients (46). Individuals who exclude
all animal foods and fish might not meet their vitamin
B,, needs. (B,, is found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and
dairy foods, though some

breakfast cereals, nondairy

milk alternatives, meat substitutes, and nutritional yeast
are fortified with B,,.) Thus it is highly recommended
that individuals who exclude food groups work with
their sports dietitian to find suitable replacements or
replacement combinations to ensure that they meet their
nutrient requirements for health and performance.

*** Oils have a recommended daily allowance versus recommended daily amount. The daily allowance is appropriate for individuals who

Fruit. In general, 1 cup of fruit or 100% fruit juice, or 1/2 cup of dried fruit, can be considered as 1 cup from the Fruit Group.
Vegetables. Any vegetable or 100% vegetable juice counts as a member of the Vegetable Group. Vegetables may be raw or cooked;
fresh, frozen, canned, or dried-dehydrated; and may be whole, cut up, or mashed.

Grains. Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain Is a grain product. Bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast
cereals, tortillas, and grits are examples of grain products.
Protein foods. All foods made from meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds are considered part of the Protein Foods Group. Beans and peas are also part of the Vegetable Group. In general, 1 ounce of meat, poultry, or fish,
1/4 cup cooked beans, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, or 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds can be considered as 1 ounce equivalent
from the Protein Foods Group.

Dairy. All fluid milk products and many foods made from milk are considered part of this food group. Most Dairy Group choices should
be fat free or low fat. Foods made from milk that retain their calcium content are part of the group. Foods made from milk that have little
to no calcium, such as cream cheese, cream, and butter, are not. Calcium-fortified soymilk (soy beverage) is also part of the Dairy Group.

Oils. Oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature, like the vegetable oils used in cooking. Oils come from many different plants and
from fish. Oils are not a food group, but they provide essential nutrients. Therefore, oils are included in USDA food patterns.

are for the general population; athletes may need different recommendations

depending on their level and

From U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Foods within each group share similar nutrient compositions and are considered interchangeable; however,
a variety of foods should be consumed within each
group. For example, eating an orange, an apple, and a
pear provides a broader array of essential nutrients than
is provided by three apples. A diet providing a variety of
foods from each group is more likely to meet a person’s
macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) as well
as micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) needs.
The SuperTracker section of the MyPlate website
contains sample food plans based on calorie needs, as
well as information on empty calories and food labels.
It also gives users the ability to calculate how much they
eat and to track foods, physical activities, and weight.

Dietary Reference Intakes
Because athletes eat food, not individual nutrients,

dietary recommendations should be presented in terms
of specific food choices. However, it is also important to
have an understanding of the athlete’s nutrient requirements in order to make food recommendations. The
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), created by the Food
and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National
Academies, are a complete set of nutrient intakes for

use when evaluating and planning diets for healthy
individuals. Dietary Reference Intakes are listed for the
macronutrients as well as micronutrients, electrolytes,
and water (68, 70, 72, 142, 169). The DRIs are based

on the body of literature regarding nutrient intake and
the reduction of chronic disease, as opposed to simply
prevention of dietary deficiencies (36). Because nutrient
intake can vary considerably from day to day, the DRIs
apply to a person’s usual intake. Therefore, when a sports
dietitian assesses a person’s nutrient intake, she looks
at several days in order to get an average daily intake
for each nutrient. This is especially true with regard to
evaluating intake of nutrients found in few foods or in
very small amounts in foods (115). Fewer days’ worth
of food records are needed to get a good estimation of
average protein intake, since this doesn’t vary much
from day to day (115). The DRIs include the following:
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)—the average daily nutrient requirement adequate for meeting
the needs of most healthy people within each life
stage and sex.

Adequate Intake (AI)—the average daily nutrient
intake level recommended when a RDA cannot be
established.
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)—the maximum

average daily nutrient level not associated with any
adverse health effects. Intakes above the UL increase
potential risk of adverse effects. (The UL represents
intake from all sources including food, water, and

supplements.)
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)—the average daily nutrient intake level considered sufficient



to meet the needs of half of the healthy population
within each life stage and sex.
Studies point to several nutrients of concern, nutrients
that large portions of the population are not consuming
in adequate amounts. All subgroups (males and females
in all age groups) have a high prevalence of inadequacy
of vitamin E and magnesium (71, 173). Vitamin E is
found in many foods, though oils, nuts, and seeds are

among the best sources of this nutrient. Magnesium
is in a wide variety of foods, though often in small
quantities. A few ofthe best sources of magnesium are
nuts and seeds (particularly pumpkin seeds, almonds,
and cashews) and beans, including mung beans and
lima beans (175). In addition, for all individuals over
the age of 2, mean usual intakes of fiber and potassium are below the DRI (175). The Scientific Report
of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
(176) lists fiber, potassium, calcium, and vitamin D as
nutrients of concern. Dairy foods, fortified beverages
(soy beverages, orange juice, and so on), and canned
sardines are excellent sources of calcium while fatty fish,
fortified beverages (milk, orange juice, soy beverages)
and fortified yogurt are excellent sources of vitamin D
(176). Also, iron is a concern for specific populations.
Many women and adolescent females who are capable
of becoming pregnant are deficient in iron, and many in
these same groups are not meeting their dietary folate

|

needs. Red meat, iron-fortified cereals, and beans are

excellent sources of iron. Beans, peas, peanuts, and
sunflower seeds are among the best sources of dietary
folate (176). And finally, though no longer considered
a nutrient of concern, vitamin B., absorption is affected
by insufficient hydrochloric acid in the stomach, found
in about 10-30% of older adults. Therefore, adults over
the age of 50 are encouraged to consume foods fortified
with synthetic vitamin B., or take dietary supplements,
because their bodies can typically absorb vitamin B,,
from these sources (176). B,, is found in animal foods,
fortified nutritional yeast, and fortified cereals. Beef,
lamb, veal, and fish are some ofthe best sources ofthis
nutrient (175).

Macronutrients
A macronutrient is a nutrient that is required in significant amounts in the diet. Three important classes of
macronutrients are protein, carbohydrate, and fat.

Protein
Protein is the primary structural and functional component of every cell in the human body. Dietary proteins
are used for growth and development and to build and
repair cells; they also serve as enzymes, transport carriers, and hormones. Therefore dietary protein intake

is essential for maintaining health, reproduction, and
cellular structure and function (69).
Proteins are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen. “Amino” means “nitrogen containing,”

maintenance, and repair. Higher-quality proteins are
highly digestible and contain all of the essential amino
acids. Animal-based proteins—including eggs, dairy
foods, meat, fish, and poultry—contain all of the essen-

and amino acids are the molecules that, when joined in

tial amino acids, while soy is the only plant-baséd protein
that contains all nine essential amino acids. In general,
plant proteins are less digestible than animal proteins,
though digestibility can sometimes be improved through
processing and preparation (69, 110). And though measures of protein quality, such as the protein digestibility
correct amino acid score (PDCAAS), take protein
digestibility (or bioavailability) into account as well as
a protein’s ability to provide the essential amino acids
necessary for the synthesis of body proteins and other
metabolites, they do not take into account how other
compounds within the food alter the bioavailability of
the protein’s amino acids. Foods contain antinutritional
factors—compounds that reduce the digestion and
absorption ofa nutrient, making it less available for use
by the body (159). Several antinutritional factors lead to
digestive losses and structural changes of amino acids
that limit amino acid bioavailability (110). For instance,
during cooking, some foods will brown; this browning,
called a Maillard reaction, leads to compounds that can
decrease the bioavailability of certain amino acids. And
though the majority of plant-based foods fall short in one
or more essential amino acids, vegetarians and vegans
(those who consume only plants and plant products—no
meat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk, or other foods that come
from animals) can meet their protein needs by consuming
a variety of plant foods including legumes, vegetables,

groups of afew dozen to hundreds, form the thousands
of proteins occurring in nature. Proteins in the human
body are composed of various combinations of the individual amino acids. Four amino acids can be synthesized
by the human body and are therefore considered “nonessential” because they do not need to be consumed in
the diet. Nine amino acids are “essential” because the
body cannot manufacture them—they must be obtained
through the diet. And finally, eight amino acids are
considered conditionally essential. These amino acids
are typically not essential though they become essential,
and therefore must be obtained through the diet, during
times of illness and stress (169). The amino acids are

listed in table 9.3.
Amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds.
Two amino acids together are referred to as a dipeptide,
and several amino acids together are referred to as a
polypeptide. Polypeptide chains bond together to form
a multitude of proteins with various structures and functions. Almost half of the body’s protein reserve exists
as skeletal muscle, while approximately 15% makes up
structural tissues including skin and blood. The rest of
the body’s protein reserves are in visceral tissues such
as the liver and kidney and in the bones (48).

Protein Quality and Dietary Recommendations
Protein quality is determined by amino acid content and
protein digestibility, as calculated by how much ofthe
protein’s nitrogen is absorbed during digestion and its
ability to provide the amino acids necessary for growth,

seeds, nuts, rice, and whole grains that provide different

amino acids so that all essential amino acids are consumed over the course of the day (184).
While dietary recommendations are stated as protein
requirements, the actual requirement is for amino acids.
The need for amino acids in sedentary, healthy adults
results from the constant turnover of cells and cellular
proteins. During cell turnover—the constant breakdown
and regeneration of cells—the body’s free amino acid
pool is the immediate and largest supplier of amino
acids (106). The pool is replenished from dietary protein
digestion, as well as the amino acids released from tissue
turnover. Substantially more protein is turned over daily
than is ordinarily consumed, indicating that amino acids
are recycled (119). This process is not completely efficient, however, so dietary amino acid intake is required
to replace losses.
The RDA for protein for men and women 19 years
of age and older, based on nitrogen balance studies, is
0.80 g of good-quality protein per kilogram body weight
per day (69). Children, teens, and pregnant and lactating
women have higher dietary protein needs as reflected in
the RDA for these groups. However, protein needs are

inversely proportional to calorie intake because small
amounts of protein can be metabolized as a source of
energy when a person is in a state of negative calorie
balance, when fewer calories are consumed than are

expended (e.g., typically only 1-6% of total caloric
expenditure in most circumstances but up to 10% during
prolonged exercise in a glycogen-depleted state) (69,
95, 165). In this case, the protein cannot be used for the
intended purpose of replacing the amino acid pool. When
caloric intake goes down, protein requirement goes
up (101). Therefore, the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
established an Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution
Range (AMDR) for protein, which covers a wide range
of protein intake. The AMDR is 5% to 20% of total calories for children ages | to 3 years, 10% to 30% of total
calories for children ages 4 to 18 years, and 10% to 35%
of total calories for adults older than age 18 years. Men
and women typically consume an average of 15% of their
calories from protein (172). The AMDR for a nutrient
includes a range of intakes associated with reduced risk
of chronic disease while still providing recommended
intakes of other essential nutrients (176). Though the
DRI for protein fits within the AMDR, the DRI is based
solely on body weight and therefore does not take low or
high calorie intakes into account. Based on the AMDR,
when calorie intake is lower, protein needs go up as a percentage of total calorie intake by approximately 1% for
every 100-calorie decrease below 2,000 calories. When
total calorie intake is higher, protein needs, expressed as
a percentage of total caloric intake, go down to a certain
point. In practice, sports dietitians should first establish
an athlete’s protein intake and then add carbohydrate and
fats as determined by total calorie needs (93).

Concerns About the RDA for Protein
There is controversy surrounding the RDA for protein
since some scientists suggest that adults should consume more than the RDA for bone health (54), weight
management, and building and repairing muscle (121,
122). In addition, research suggests that higher-protein,
lower-carbohydrate diets can favorably affect blood
lipids, particularly in obese individuals, and therefore
also decrease some of the risk factors for cardiovascular
disease and metabolic syndrome (94).
Protein is a building block for strong bones, contributing to 50% of bone volume and 33% of bone mass
(56). Protein’s effect on bone may be due, in part, to its
influence on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which

is produced in the liver and promotes bone and muscle
formation (151). And though research suggests that
supplemental, but not dietary, protein increases calcium
losses through urine, in healthy individuals consuming
0.7 to 2.1 g of protein per kilogram body weight, both urinary calcium excretion and intestinal calcium absorption

increase (87). In fact, low dietary protein intake (0.7 g
protein per kilogram body weight per day) suppresses
intestinal calcium absorption (86).
Protein also plays a multifaceted role in weight management. First, it promotes satiety in a dose-dependent
manner: Greater amounts of protein lead to a greater
increase in satiety (41). However, the satiating effect
of protein also depends on the timing ofprotein intake,
form (solid vs. liquid), concurrent intake of other macronutrients, and time until the next meal (5). The type
of protein may also have an effect on satiety, though
research has not fully elucidated which proteins may
have the greatest impact (16, 59, 101). Protein also has
the greatest thermic effect of feeding—more calories are
burned during the digestion of protein as compared to
carbohydrate or fat. And finally, higher protein diets help
spare muscle loss while a person is on a reduced-calorie
diet (91, 134).
The amino acids in protein are used for growth
(including muscle growth) and for repairing tissue,
synthesizing enzymes and hormones, and repairing and
making new cells. And though adults in a general fitness
program can likely meet their protein requirements by
consuming 0.8 to 1.0 g of protein per kilogram body
weight per day, athletes and those who exercise intensely
require more protein (21). Aerobic endurance athletes
who consume a sufficient number of calories require
approximately 1.0 to 1.6 g of protein per kilogram
body weight per day (128, 165). Strength athletes need
approximately 1.4 to 1.7 g of protein per kilogram body
weight per day (96). Athletes who generally do a combination of strength and aerobic endurance or anaerobic
sprint training and who are consuming adequate calories
should ingest 1.4 to 1.7 g of protein per kilogram body
weight. Athletes who are on a reduced-calorie diet may
need more protein per day to preserve muscle tissue
during weight loss.
In addition to eating the right amount of protein per
day, research supports the idea of athletes consuming
sufficient protein right after exercise, when muscle tissue
is most receptive to amino acids. In fact, after exercise,
both muscle protein synthesis and breakdown are
increased, though net protein balance is negative when
the exercise is done in a fasted state (127). Protein consumed after exercise increases muscle protein synthesis,
and muscle sensitivity to amino acids 1s enhanced for
up to 48 hours after a bout of exercise. However, this
sensitivity goes down over time; therefore consuming
protein sooner, rather than waiting, has a greater effect
on acute muscle protein synthesis (28, 42, 97, 145).
The amount of protein an athlete should consume after
aerobic endurance exercise has yet to be fully elucidated.
However, some suggest a 4:1 or 3:1 ratio of carbohydrate
to protein as a general guideline (85). After resistance




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

training, a wide range of protein intakes, 20 to 48 g,
has proven beneficial for maximally stimulating acute
muscle protein synthesis (82). The amount appears to
depend, at least in part, on the leucine content of the

protein (28) and is also affected by age, since sensitivity
to amino acids decreases in older adults (84).
Concerns surrounding protein intakes above the RDA
are unfounded for the most part in healthy individuals
(105). Proteins consumed in excess of the amount needed
for the synthesis of tissue are broken down (65), the
nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, and the remaining
ketoacids are either used directly as sources of energy
or converted to carbohydrate (gluconeogenesis) or
body fat (60). In fact, a study examining high protein
intake in athletes found that protein intakes up to 2.8 g
per kilogram body weight (as assessed by a seven-day
diet record) didn’t impair any measures of renal function (132). The strength and conditioning professional
should be aware that consistently high protein intakes,
above recommended levels for building and repairing
muscle, are not recommended because carbohydrate
and fat intake (and the nutrients commonly found in
carbohydrate- and fat-rich foods) may be compromised.
The protein content of commonly consumed foods
is listed in table 9.4.
Athletes require more than the RDA for protein to build and repair muscle. Depending
on the sport and the training program, 1.0
to.1.7 g per kilogram body weight of protein
is recommended.

Carbohydrate
Carbohydrate primarily serves as a source of energy.
However, carbohydrate is not an essential nutrient,
because the body can break down the carbon skeletons

of certain amino acids and convert them into glucose
(i1.e., gluconeogenesis). Carbohydrates are composed
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Carbohydrates can be
classified into three groups according to the number of
sugar (saccharide) units they contain: monosaccharides,
disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose)
are single-sugar molecules. In the body, glucose is present as circulating sugar in the blood, where it is used
as the primary energy substrate for cells. In addition,
glucose molecules make up glycogen, a polysaccharide stored in muscle and liver cells. In food, glucose
is typically combined with other monosaccharides to
form various sugars, such as sucrose. Isolated glucose
found in candy or sport drinks is found in the form of
dextrose, a chemical isomer ofglucose. Fructose has the

same chemical formula as glucose, but because the atoms

are arranged differently, it tastes much sweeter and has
different properties. Fructose accounts for the sweet taste
of honey and occurs naturally in fruits and vegetables. In
the body, fructose causes less insulin secretion than other
sugars, which has made it a focus of much research in
the area of aerobic endurance performance. Galactose,
the third monosaccharide, combines with glucose to
form lactose, milk sugar.
Disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, and maltose) are
composed of two simple sugar units joined together.
Sucrose (or table sugar), the most common disaccharide,
is acombination of glucose and fructose. Sucrose occurs
naturally in most fruits and is crystallized from the syrup
of sugar cane and sugar beets to make brown, white, or

powdered sugar. Lactose (glucose + galactose) is found
only in mammalian milk. Maltose (glucose + glucose)
occurs primarily when polysaccharides are broken down
during digestion. It also occurs in the fermentation process of alcohol and is the primary carbohydrate in beer.
Polysaccharides, also known as complex carbohydrates, contain up to thousands of glucose units. Some
of the most common polysaccharides of nutritional
importance are starch, fiber, and glycogen. Starch is the
storage form of glucose in plants. Grains, legumes, and
vegetables are good sources of starch. Before starch can
be used as a source of energy, it must be broken down
into glucose components. Dietary fiber, a constituent
of the plant cell wall, is also a form of carbohydrate.
Cellulose, hemicellulose, beta-glucans, and pectins are
fibers; these and noncarbohydrate fibrous materials (lig-

nins) are partially resistant to human digestive enzymes.
Fibers have different physiological effects in the body.
Some delay gastric emptying, which may temporarily
influence feelings of fullness, while other types of fiber
increase bulk and water content, reducing constipation
and decreasing transit time of feces. In addition, some
soluble fibers decrease the absorption of cholesterol and
may therefore help reduce blood cholesterol levels after
ingestion (104), while prebiotic dietary fibers selectively
stimulate the growth of bacteria in the gut (32, 135).
Fiber-rich foods include beans, peas, bran, many fruits
and vegetables, and some whole-grain foods.
Glycogen is found in small (77, 166) amounts in
human liver and muscle, totaling approximately 15 g of
glycogen per kilogram body weight (1), and in animal
tissue as a temporary source of stored energy (20). While
present in animal meats we eat such as steak, chicken
breast, and fish fillets, it is not present to any large extent.
When glucose enters the muscles and liver, if it is not
metabolized for energy it can be synthesized to form
glycogen. Three-quarters of the glycogen in the body is
stored in skeletal muscle; the remaining quarter is stored
in the liver (20). The process of converting glucose to
glycogen is called glycogenesis.

Athletes typically consume a variety of carbohydrates in their normal diets. However, when they want
to improve the quality of their diet, by consuming fewer

foods that have untoward effects on overall health or

performance, they may consider macronutrient ranking
systems such as the glycemic index or glycemic load.




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load
The glycemic index (GI) ranks carbohydrates according to how quickly they are digested and absorbed, and
therefore raise blood glucose levels, in the 2-hour time

period after a meal, compared to the same amount (by
weight in grams) of a reference food, typically white
bread or glucose, which is given a GI of 100 (76).
Glycemic index = [Incremental area under
the curve for the blood glucose response after
consumption of a 25 or 50g carbohydrate
portion of a test food + Incremental area under
the curve for the blood glucose response after
consumption of the same portion (in grams) of
a standard food] * 100
Low-GI foods are digested and absorbed slowly,
resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose and subsequent insulin release from the pancreas compared to the
reference food (45). Insulin helps lower blood glucose
levels by facilitating glucose transport into cells. The fate
of glucose within cells depends on where it is shuttled.
For instance, muscle cells use glucose for energy while
fat cells convert glucose into triglycerides (fat).
Though the GI was developed to help people better
control their blood sugar levels—something that is
particularly helpful for those with diabetes—some
researchers hypothesized that diets composed of lowerversus higher-GI foods may also help decrease risk of
obesity and other diseases (99, 100). However, the GI
system has a few issues that may limit its accuracy. First,

published GI values for a given type of food may vary
considerably due to differences in testing and variations
in ingredients used, ripeness of food, method of food
processing, cooking, and storage (27, 60). Secondly,

TABLE 9.5
Low Gl foods (55 or less)

consuming carbohydrate as part of a meal or in different
quantities affects the GI (45). Low-GI foods generally
include vegetables, legumes, beans, and whole grains
(see table 9.5).
Although some scientists have speculated‘that consumption of low-GI foods before exercise might spare
carbohydrate by minimizing insulin secretion and
therefore improve performance, there is insufficient
evidence to support this hypothesis (21). The research
is mixed, with some studies showing that consumption
of a low-GI food as compared to a high-GI food before
exercise improves exercise time to exhaustion (35, 167)
and others finding that consuming a preexercise low-GI
food versus a high-GI food had no effect on running
performance (160, 180).
Therefore, athletes who use the GI to guide their food
choices can try preexercise low- and high-GI foods in
training while sticking with high-GI foods during exercise to provide immediate sources of energy (sugar) for
activity (23) and immediately after exercise to more
rapidly replenish glycogen stores (131).
The glycemic load (GL) takes the amount of carbohydrate, in grams, in a portion of food into account—a
factor that also influences glycemic response. Because
GL takes portion size into account, it is a more realistic
gauge of glycemic response than the GI, which is based
ona standard serving size. Table 9.6 shows the difference
in GI and GL for specific foods. The GL is equal to the
GI multiplied by the amount of carbohydrate in a portion
of the food and dividing this total by 100.

Foods with a higher GL are expected to lead to greater
increases in blood sugar and subsequent insulin release
(45).
A low-GL diet, combined with exercise, has been

shown to improve insulin sensitivity in older, obese adults
and therefore may be a potential treatment for this population (90), while observational and intervention studies

suggest that low-Gl and low-GL diets are associated with
lower levels of inflammatory markers. Chronic low-grade
inflammation is considered a potential risk factor for
chronic diseases (19). In addition, some (though not all)
studies have found that diets with a lower GI or GL are
associated with lower levels of fasting insulin as well as
fewer cardiovascular risk factors (63, 152).




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

Fiber

Athletes adapt to dietary changes in carbohydrate intake. Though athletes who regularly consume carbohydrates use them as
a primary source of energy during aerobic
exercise, consistent intake of a low-carbohydrate diet leads to greater reliance on fat
as a source of fuel.

Diets low in fiber have been associated with constipation, heart disease, colon cancer, and type 2 diabetes.

The DRI for fiber ranges from 21 to 29 g/day for women
(depending on age, pregnancy, and lactation) and 30
to 38 g/day for men based on age group. Fiber is commonly found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes,

and whole-grain products such as whole-grain bread,
oatmeal, and popcorn.

Fat

Carbohydrate Requirements for Athletes

Although the terms fat and Jipid are often used interchangeably, Jipid is a broader term. Lipids include

Numerous studies show that carbohydrates can improve
time to exhaustion during aerobic endurance performance as well as work output and performance in
high-intensity intermittent sports (2, 11). High glycogen
levels have also been shown to spare the use of protein
for fuel, thereby helping attenuate muscle breakdown
(though differences in protein intake also affect muscle
breakdown) (64).
Carbohydrate recommendations are largely based on
type of training. Aerobic endurance athletes training 90
minutes or more per day at moderate intensity (70-80%
VO,max) should aim for 8 to 10 g of carbohydrate per
kilogram body weight per day (75). Athletes who benefit from this level of carbohydrate intake include those
engaged in continuous aerobic activity such as distance
runners, road cyclists, triathletes, and cross-country

skiers. Research has shown that athletes consistently
engaged in high-intensity, intermittent activities, such
as soccer players, also benefit from high-carbohydrate
diets (10, 163). Research on the carbohydrate needs of
athletes in a wide variety of sports such as basketball
players, wrestlers, and volleyball players is limited.
Athletes who participate in strength, sprint, and skill
activities need approximately 5 to 6 g of carbohydrate
per kilogram body weight per day (153).
Within 30 minutes after aerobic endurance training,
approximately 1.5 g of higher-glycemic carbohydrate per
kilogram of body weight should be consumed to quickly
stimulate glycogen resynthesis (74). Athletes can consume less carbohydrate in the time period immediately
postexercise as long as they consume a higher-carbohydrate meal or snack at regular intervals (approximately
every 2 hours) after finishing training. Athletes who
do not train every day can restore their glycogen over
the course of a 24-hour period if they consume enough
total carbohydrate in their diet. And finally, despite the
profound effect glycogen has on performance, athletes
adapt to low-carbohydrate diets, which will decrease
their reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source during
exercise (43). Some athletes also use this strategy to
decrease their total calorie intake.

triglycerides (fats and oils) as well as related fatty compounds, such as sterols and phospholipids. The lipids of
greatest significance in nutrition are triglycerides, fatty
acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Triglycerides are
formed by the union of glycerol with three fatty acids.
The majority of lipids found in foods and in the body
are in the triglyceride form, and within this chapter the
term fat refers to triglycerides.
Like carbohydrate, fat contains carbon, oxygen, and
hydrogen atoms; but because the fatty acid chains have
more carbon and hydrogen relative to oxygen, they provide more energy per gram. For example, fats provide
approximately 9 kcal/g, while carbohydrates and protein
provide approximately 4 kcal/g. Dietary fats and oils are
composed of different types of fatty acids.
Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, and
their carbon molecules are saturated with hydrogen.
Saturated fatty acids are used for certain physiological
and structural functions, but the body can make these
fatty acids; therefore there is no dietary requirement
for saturated fatty acids (174). Unsaturated fatty acids
contain some carbon molecules that are joined together
by double bonds, making them more chemically more
reactive. Fatty acids containing one double bond are
monounsaturated. With two or more double bonds, a

fatty acid is polyunsaturated. Two polyunsaturated fatty
acids are considered essential, meaning that the body
cannot make them: omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.
These two fatty acids are necessary for the formation of
healthy cell membranes, proper development and functioning of the brain and nervous system, and hormone
production. Omega-6 fatty acids are abundant in the food
supply and found in foods such as soybean, corn, and
safflower oil and products made with these oils. Fewer
foods contain omega-3 fatty acids; these include fish,
particularly fatty fish such as salmon, herring, halibut,
trout, and mackerel, which contain the omega-3 fatty
acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Eicosapentaenoic acid and DHA
are tied to a dose-dependent decrease in triglycerides;
a small, but statistically significant, decrease in blood

pressure, especially in the elderly; and potential antiarrhythmic effects (107, 113).
One could also consume flaxseeds, walnuts, soybean
oil, or canola oil to meet omega-3 requirements since
these contain the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic
acid (ALA), which is converted to EPA and DHA. However, this conversion process is inefficient. According to
vivo studies, approximately 5% of ALA is converted to
EPA and <0.5% of ALA is converted to DHA in adults
(130). Therefore, while foods that contain ALA count
toward one’s omega-3 intake, they do not have a substantial effect on EPA and DHA levels in the body. Foods
rich in ALA may improve some risk factors for cardiovascular disease; however, it isn’t clear which is responsible—ALA, the other compounds in these nutrient-rich
foods, or a combination of the two (38). In addition to

its physiological functions, fat is important because it
is responsible for the characteristic flavor, aroma, and

texture of many foods. Generally, most dietary fats and
oils are a mix of all three types of fatty acids, with one
type predominating. Soy, corn, sunflower, and safflower
oils are relatively high in polyunsaturated fatty acids;
olive, peanut, and canola oils are high in monounsat-

urated fatty acids; and most animal fats and tropical
oils (e.g., coconut, palm kernel) are relatively high in
saturated fatty acids.
When stored in the human body, fat serves many
functions. Energy is stored primarily as adipose tissue
in humans, but small amounts are also found in skeletal
muscle, especially in aerobically trained athletes (150).
Body fat insulates and protects organs, regulates hor-

of saturated or trans fats, weight gain, and anorexia can
all increase LDL cholesterol (162). However,

VLDL

levels increase with increasing intake of carbohydrate
(116). High levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL)
are protective against heart disease, but are not a target
of therapy (practitioners are told not to focus on HDL).
Table 9.7 shows how LDL, total, and HDL cholesterol
are Classified.
High intake of refined carbohydrates, weight gain,
excessive alcohol intake, and very-low-fat diets can
increase triglycerides (blood fats). However, as with
cholesterol, several factors affect triglycerides, including
a sedentary lifestyle, overweight or obesity, smoking,
genetics, and certain diseases and medications

(125,

162).
The Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee recommends avoiding partially
hydrogenated oils containing trans fat and limiting saturated fat to less than 10% oftotal calories and replacing
saturated fat with unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fat. In addition, it is advised that added sugars
consumed be a maximum of 10% oftotal calories (176).

Fat and Performance
Both intramuscular and circulating fatty acids are potential energy sources during exercise (126). Compared with
the limited capacity of the body to store carbohydrate,
fat stores are large and represent a vast source of fuel

has many essential functions in the body, high levels
of cholesterol may lead to atherosclerosis, hardening
of the arteries due to plaque build up on artery walls,
which narrows the area within arteries that blood can
pass through. Therefore, having high levels of blood
cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
High levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and triglycerides are all associated with
increased risk of heart disease. Low-density lipoprotein
is further divided into subfractions based on particle size.
Smaller, more dense particles, called very low-density

lipoproteins (VLDL), are more atherogenic (artery

LDL = low-density lipoprotein; HDL = high-density lipoprotein.
Lipoprotein level testing should be completed after a 9- to 12-hour

Vitamins are organic substances (i.e., containing carbon
atoms) needed in very small amounts to perform specific
metabolic functions (67, 177). Vitamins typically act as
coenzymes, facilitating numerous reactions in the body.
For instance, B vitamins help the body make energy from
the metabolism of carbohydrates. Table 9.8 describes the
functions and some food sources of individual vitamins.
Water-soluble vitamins, including the B vitamins
and vitamin C, dissolve in water and are transported in
the blood. With the exception of vitamin B,,, which is
stored in the liver for years, water-soluble vitamins are
not stored in appreciable amounts in the body; instead
the body uses what is needed and then excretes the

a gradual shift from fat to carbohydrate as the preferred
source of fuel. Consistent aerobic training increases the
muscle’s capacity to use fatty acids (79). In addition to
training, the body adapts to using greater amounts of
fat for energy when a higher-fat, lower-carbohydrate

“Antioxidants are substances that modify cell-signaling pathways and counteract oxidative stress-induced cell damage caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (free radicals). Free radicals are both beneficial and harmful to human health. An overproduction of,
or overexposure to, free radicals combined with a deficiency in antioxidants can result in oxidative stress and subsequent damage to
cellular lipids, proteins, and DNA (67, 177).
**Dietary Reference Intake (DRI): A set of nutrient recommendations that include the values Recommended

Dietary Allowance (RDA),

Adequate Intake (Al), Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), and the Tolerable Upper Level Intake (UL).

Tolerable Upper Level Intake (UL): The highest daily intake of a nutrient that is likely to not pose a risk of adverse health effects in most
of the general population.
DRis and UL are listed as a range across the life span for each sex.

remaining amounts in urine (170). And though there
are no known side effects from excess vitamin B,, consumption, consuming more than the body can use will
not increase energy or improve health (17, 72). Vitamins

A, D, E, and K are fat soluble and therefore carried by
fat in the blood and stored in fat tissue in the body (142).

Excess preformed vitamin A (not beta carotene, alpha
carotene, or beta cryptoxanthin, which are converted


Basic Nutrition Factors in Health

into vitamin A in the body) is toxic and associated with
significant adverse effects including liver damage,
intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness,

Minerals
Minerals contribute to the structure of bone, teeth, and
nails; are a component of enzymes; and perform a wide
variety of metabolic functions. For example, calcium is
needed for bone and tooth formation and function, nerve
transmission, and muscle contraction. Iron is necessary
for oxygen transport and is also a component of enzymes
necessary for energy metabolism. Calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, iron, and the electrolytes sodium, potassium, and chloride are often called the major minerals.

nausea, headaches, skin irritation, pain in joints and
bones, coma, and even death (67, 141). Excess vitamin

A intake can occur through diet but typically results
from high levels of vitamin A in supplements (70, 142).
Toxic levels of vitamin D can lead to heart arrhythmias
and increased levels of blood calcium, which can cause

blood vessel and tissue calcification, as well as damage
to the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys (142). Vitamin
E acts as an anticoagulant and therefore thins the blood.
Regular intake of excessive amounts of vitamin E can
lead to high serum vitamin E levels, which is associated
with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in
individuals on blood thinners (124). Because vitamin K
helps blood clot, excess intake of this vitamin can interfere with the effects of some anticlotting medications
such as warfarin (Coumadin) (92).

For the athlete, minerals are important for bone health,

oxygen-carrying capacity, and fluid and electrolyte
balance. The minerals, their functions, and good food

sources are listed in table 9.9.
Two minerals, iron and calcium, deserve additional

attention. Athletes who do not consume enough dietary
iron can develop iron deficiency or iron deficiency
anemia, both of which can impair performance.

Mineral

Zinc

Inadequate dietary calcium can contribute to low bone

Iron
Iron is essential for both the functioning and synthesis of
hemoglobin, a protein that transfers oxygen throughout
the body (158). In addition, iron is a component of the
protein myoglobin, which transports oxygen to muscles
(51). This mineral plays important roles in growth,
development, cell functioning, and the synthesis and
functioning of some hormones (41, 46, 85).

Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutrition
deficiency in the world (183). And though it disproportionately affects those in developing countries, it is
common in industrialized countries as well. The National

Females: 90-400 mcg (UL)

Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (NHANES)
found that approximately 16% of teenage girls aged 16
to 19 and 12% of women aged 20 to 49 were deficient
in iron. In some studies examining iron deficiency in
female aerobic endurance athletes, more than one in

four women tested positive for iron deficiency (102,
137). Iron deficiency occurs in three stages (in order of
severity): depletion, marginal deficiency, and anemia
(89, 118). Iron carries oxygen to the working muscles,
and even marginal iron deficiency may impair athletic
performance (18, 61). Iron deficiency anemia develops
when low iron stores persist for a period of time and
the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells
to deliver oxygen throughout the body (157, 161).
Symptoms depend on the individual; some people are
asymptomatic or get used to their symptoms and assume


Basic Nutrition Factors in Health

that they are normal. Symptoms of deficiency iron
deficiency or iron deficiency anemia may include weakness, fatigue, irritability, poor concentration, headache,
decreased exercise capacity, hair loss, and dry mouth
(15). Other symptoms associated with iron deficiency
anemia include feeling cold often, inflamed tongue
(glossitis), shortness of breath during routine activities,
and pica (the desire to eat nonfood substances such as
laundry starch, dirt, clay, and ice) (111).
Women of childbearing age, teenage girls, pregnant
women, infants, and toddlers have the greatest need for
iron and therefore an increased risk of becoming deficient. In addition, distance runners, vegetarian athletes,

female athletes, those who lose a significant amount of
blood during their menstrual cycle, people who take
excessive amounts of antacids, and people with certain digestive diseases such as celiac disease have an
increased risk of developing iron deficiency anemia (70).
The two types of iron found in food are heme and
nonheme iron. Heme iron, derived from hemoglobin,
is found in foods that originally contained hemoglobin
and myoglobin—animal foods including red meats, fish,
and poultry. Heme iron is absorbed better than nonheme
iron, and absorption isn’t affected by anything else we
eat. We absorb approximately 15% to 35% of the heme
iron we eat (111).
Nonheme iron is the form of iron found in all other,

non-meat foods including vegetables, grains, and
iron-fortified breakfast cereal. Only 2% to 20% of nonheme iron is absorbed (165). And, while heme iron is not
affected by compounds found in food eaten concurrently,
many factors affect the absorption of nonheme iron.
For instance, the nonheme iron in spinach is bound to a
substance called phytic acid, the storage form of phosphorus in plants. Phytic acid decreases the absorption
of nonheme iron. In addition, several other substances

may decrease the absorption of nonheme iron, including
tannins (found in tea and wine), calcium (found in dairy
and multivitamins), polyphenols, phytates (found in
legumes and whole grains), and some of the proteins in
soy. A person can increase the amount of nonheme iron
absorbed by consuming vitamin C—rich foods or bever-

ages at the same time or consuming a nonheme source
at the same time heme iron is consumed. For example,
pairing spinach with meat increases iron absorption from
spinach (70, 165).
There are many supplemental forms of iron; each
supplies a different amount of elemental iron while
also varying in bioavailability and the potential for side
effects such as stomach upset (103). In addition, both
calcium and supplemental magnesium may interfere
with iron absorption (179). Yet many Americans are not
consuming enough calcium and magnesium through diet
alone. Because of the many factors affecting iron intake
and absorption, including intake of other minerals the
athlete may not be consuming in adequate quantities,
only a medical doctor or registered dietitian should
recommend iron supplements and how to take an iron
supplement for maximum absorption and minimal stomach upset (24, 47, 114, 144, 179).

Calcium
Adequate calcium intake throughout childhood and
adolescence is essential for the development of strong
bones. Calcium helps bones grow in length and density
during adolescence, with up to 90% of peak bone mineral
density occurring during late adolescence (58, 154). And
in adults, calcium helps maintain bone density. When
dietary calcium intake falls short, calcium is pulled from
its storage site in bone to meet the demands of the body
and keep calcium concentrations in the blood, muscle,
and intercellular fluids constant. Calcium is essential
for attaining peak bone mass, and calcium deficiencies
can impair the attainment of peak bone mineral density
and increase risk of fracture later in life (71). Calcium
also keeps teeth strong, heips regulate muscle contraction, and plays a role in nerve functioning, blood vessel
expansion and contraction, and hormone and enzyme
secretion (71).
The NHANES found that just 15% of 9- to 13-yearold females and less than 10% of females aged 14 to 18
and over the age of 51 met the adequate intake (AI) for
calcium from diet alone (9). Therefore, athletes should
be encouraged to include dairy products and other

Caloric Versus Nutrient-Dense Foods
Given the rise in obesity in America, some classify the American diet as calorie dense but nutrient poor. The
Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommends a dietary pattern including
a variety of nutrient-dense foods. Though there is no standardized definition of the term nutrient density,
in general, choosing nutrient-dense foods means looking for foods based on the nutrients such as vitamins,
minerals, and fiber, as well as the healthy plant-based compounds that they provide, whereas caloric density
refers to the caloric content of a food. Foods high in nutrient density include milk, vegetables, protein foods,
and grains, while foods high in caloric density but low in nutrient density typically include potato chips, des-

serts, and candy (39). For more information on nutrient versus caloric density, the reader is referred to the
work of Drewnowski (39).




Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning

calcium-rich foods in their diets. The athlete’s medical
doctor or registered dietitian may suggest a calcium
supplement if calcium needs cannot be met through
diet alone.

Fluid and Electrolytes
Water is the largest component of the body, representing
45% to 75% of a person’s body weight (68). In the human
body, water acts as a lubricant, shock absorber, building
material, and solvent. In addition, water is essential for

body temperature regulation (water loss through sweat
helps cool off skin, particularly in hot environments and
during exercise), nutrient transport and waste product
removal, and maintaining fluid balance and therefore
normal blood pressure (78). Water is so important that
even under optimal temperature conditions, the body can
survive only a few days without water (99).
While maintaining adequate hydration is important
for all individuals, athletes must pay close attention to
their hydration status since sweat losses that exceed fluid
intake can quickly lead to a hypohydrated state with a
subsequent increase in core body temperature, decrease
in blood plasma volume, and increase in heart rate and
perceived exertion (31, 147). When this happens, sweat
output cannot keep up with increases in core body
temperature unless fluids are given. Repeated exercise
in hot environments helps the body adapt to heat stress
(e.g., greater sweat volume, lower electrolyte concentration of sweat, and lower temperature for the onset of
sweating), and therefore athletes may be more prone
to dehydration and heat stress at the beginning of the
season (50). In addition, athletes with less training may
be more prone to heat stress than trained athletes (45).
Due to physiological changes that alter water conservation in the body as well as age-related decline in fluid
intake, the elderly have an increased risk of dehydration
and hypohydration (45). Children may have a greater
risk of dehydration as well, resulting from increased
heat gain from the environment due to greater surface
area—body mass ratio compared to adults, increased heat
production during exercise, decreased ability to dissipate
heat through sweat, and a decreased sensation of thirst
compared to adults (12, 40). In addition, those with sickle
cell trait, cystic fibrosis, and some other diseases have an
increased risk of becoming dehydrated (12, 168). Even
mild dehydration, representing 2% to 3% weight loss,
can increase core body temperature and significantly
affect athletic performance by increasing fatigue and
decreasing motivation, neuromuscular control, accuracy, power, strength, muscular endurance, and overall
peLionniance- (13725. 3), 555.518 sos

Dehydration can increase core body temperature, reduce

stroke volume and cardiac output, decrease blood pressure, reduce blood flow to muscles, increase heartbeat,

exacerbate symptomatic exertional rhabdomyolysis,
and increase risk of heatstroke and death (31, 52, 109,

146). One’s risk for dehydration is greater in hot, humid
environments and at altitude (26, 109, 117).

Fluid Balance
The AI for water is 3.7 L (125.1 fluid ounces or 15.6
cups) and 2.7 L (91.3 fluid ounces or 11.4 cups) per
day, respectively, for men and women. However, the Al
for pregnant and lactating women is 3.0 L (101.4 fluid
ounces or 12.7 cups) and 3.8 L (128.49 fluid ounces or
16.1 cups) per day, respectively. All sources of fluid,
including beverages such as coffee, tea, juice, and soda,
as well as the fluid in foods, contribute to meeting a
person’s water needs (68).
Maintaining fluid balance during training and competition can be a challenge for many athletes, particularly those who sweat profusely or train in hot, humid
environments or at altitude. In addition to environmental
conditions, clothing, equipment, and larger body size can
increase sweat rate, while unsafe weight loss practices
such frequent use or overuse of diuretics or laxatives
can increase risk of dehydration (31, 34). American
football players, particularly linemen, have a greater
risk of becoming dehydrated because of their equipment
and in many cases, larger body size (31). For example,
a study in National Football League players found that
backs and receivers, with an average body mass of 93
+ 6 kg (204.6 + 13.2 pounds), lost an average of 1.4 +
0.45 L (47.3 + 15.2 fluid ounces; or approximately 6 +
2 cups) of sweat per hour, while linemen, with an average body mass of 135.6 + 17 kg (298 + 37.4 pounds),
lost an average 2.25 + 0.68 L (75.1 + 1.5 fluid ounces;
approximately 9 cups) of sweat per hour during practice.
Calculated sweat losses for both groups during a total of
4.5 hours of practice on days with two practice sessions
were 6.4 + 2.0 L (216.4 + 67.6 fluid ounces; approximately 27 + 8 cups) for backs and receivers and 10.1 +
3.1 L (341.5 + 104.8 fluid ounces; 42.7 + 13.1 cups) for
linemen (51). Multiple layers of clothing and protective
equipment contribute to sweat losses and dehydration
risk in hockey players (14), while intentional dehydration and other unsafe weight loss practices can increase
dehydration risk in wrestlers (52, 181). In addition, it is
important to note that a very wide range of fluid losses
through sweat exists. For instance, National Basketball
Association players lost from 1.0 to 4.6 L (33.8-155.5
fluid ounces; 4.2-19.4 cups) and had a mean loss of2.2
+ 0.8 L (74.4 + 27.1 fluid ounces; 9.3 + 3.4 cups) of
sweat over the course of a 40-minute game in which the
average playing time was 21 + 8 minutes (120). When


Basic Nutrition Factors in Health

people are sedentary, respiration and sweat combined
contribute to water losses equal to approximately 0.3 L
(20.2 fluid ounces; 2.5 cups) per hour (148).

Preventing Dehydration
Given the negative effects associated with dehydration, athletes should try to prevent water weight losses
exceeding 2% of body weight while also restoring
electrolytes lost through sweat (146, 147). The first step
to preventing dehydration is to assess hydration status
(table 9.10). Urine specific gravity (USG) can be used
to access hydration status because the test is easy to use,
inexpensive, and portable (178). However, USG is nota
sensitive indicator of acute changes in hydration; instead
it is better as a measure of chronic hydration status (120,
133). A quick and simple method for estimating hydration status involves measuring changes in body weight
from pre- to postworkout. Athletes should weigh themselves in minimal, lightweight clothing, after drying off
and urinating, immediately before and after their workout. Sweaty clothes should be removed before weighing.
Each pound (0.45 kg) lost during practice represents 16
ounces (0.5 L) of fluid. A loss of 2% or more of body
weight indicates the athlete is not adequately replacing
fluid lost through sweat (146). In addition to identifying
acute dehydration from one workout, assessing weight
changes over time may help identify athletes who are
chronically dehydrated—those who lose several pounds
over the course of a few days (22).
In addition to identifying athletes who do not adequately hydrate, one can calculate sweat rate, thereby
giving a better idea of fluid needs during exercise, by
weighing athletes preexercise and again after an intense
1-hour practice session while also measuring fluid intake
and urine volume produced. Sweat rate is equal to preexercise body weight minus postexercise body weight +
fluid intake during exercise — urine produced (14, 22).
Assessments of urine quantity, through USG or urine
volume, may be misleading during the immediate rehy-

dration period after dehydration. When athletes consume
large quantities of hypotonic fluid, they produce copious
amounts of urine long before they become adequately
hydrated (156).
In addition to monitoring weight changes, athletes are
sometimes advised to check their urine color. However,
the relationship between urine color and hydration status
is very subjective (68, 109, 146). Also, beets, blackberries, certain food colors, and medications can turn urine
pink, red, or light brown (49). In addition, B vitamins,
carotenoids (such as beta carotene), and some medica-

tions can turn urine dark yeilow, bright yellow, or orange,
while artificial food colors (such as those found in some
sport drinks) may also turn urine blue or green (178).
A very wide range of fluid losses, in the form
of sweat, exists among athletes. Therefore
each athlete should develop an individualized hydration plan.

Electrolytes
The major electrolytes lost in sweat include sodium
chloride, and, to a lesser extent and in order, potassium,
magnesium, and calcium (88). Sodium influences fluid
regulation by helping retain more of the fluid consumed
(108). In addition, all of the electrolytes lost through
sweat are essential to muscle contraction and nerve
conduction. Thus, any disturbance in the balance of
electrolytes in body fluids could potentially interfere
with performance. Sodium losses through sweat vary
tremendously between athletes, with reported concentrations ranging from 0.2 to greater than 12.5 g/L (10
to over 544 mEq/L) (31, 146). Given the large quantity
of sodium some athletes lose through sweat, replacing
sodium losses may require a conscious decision to
choose higher-sodium foods, salt their food, and add
electrolytes to their sport drinks. Athletes who exercise
intensely or for hours and hydrate excessively with only
water or a no- or low-sodium beverage may dilute their

blood sodium levels to dangerously low levels—below
130 mmol/L—a condition called hyponatremia. This
leads to intracellular swelling, and, when blood sodium
levels fall below 125 mmol/L, to headaches, nausea,

vomiting, muscle cramps, swollen hands and feet, restlessness, and disorientation. When blood sodium drops

below 120 mmol/L, risk of developing cerebral edema,
seizures, coma, brain stem herniation, respiratory arrest,

and risk of death increase (4, 6, 146). To avoid hyponatremia, fluid intake shouldn’t exceed sweat losses (athletes should not weigh more after they finish exercising
than they did at the start of their training session), and
athletes should consume sodium through either sport
drinks or food (120, 146).
Sport drinks provide small amounts of potassium to
replace sweat potassium losses. However, they are not
a significant contributor to total potassium intake. And,
because research shows that <2% of adults in the United
States meet the dietary recommendations for potassium
(29), athletes should focus on consuming more potassium-rich foods in their diet, such as tomatoes, citrus
fruits, melons, potatoes, bananas, and milk.

Athletes who exercise intensely or for hours
and hydrate excessively with only water ora
no- or low-sodium beverage may dilute their
blood sodium to dangerously low levels.

Fluid Intake Guidelines
Ideally, athletes should start exercise or training in a
hydrated state, avoid losing more than 2% of body
weight (due to sweat losses) during exercise, and
rehydrate completely after exercise and before the next
training session. The amount of fluid necessary to fully
achieve rehydration depends on the time period before
the next bout of training. However, studies show that
some athletes start practice or competition in a hypohydrated state, making it more difficult to consume
enough fluid during the exercise session to make up
for poor preexercise hydration status (120, 138). In
addition, athletes with significant sweat losses may not
voluntarily drink enough fluid to adequately rehydrate
and prevent dehydration during training and competition.
A systematic approach to fluid replacement is necessary for this reason and also because thirst may not be
a reliable indicator of fluid needs for athletes who are
heavy sweaters or those who are practicing intensely in
hot environmental conditions (22). Though fluid and
electrolyte guidelines should be individualized as much
as possible, given the wide range of fluid and electrolyte
losses in athletes, the general guidelines presented next
are a good starting place with athletes until specific
recommendations can be provided based on sweat rate
(7). In addition, strength coaches should ensure that
athletes are given adequate time to drink and access to
cool fluids (10-15 °C [50-59 °F]) (80).

Fluid Intake Guidelines at a Glance
Before Training
e

Athletes should have a USG reading <1.020. They should prehydrate, if necessary, several hours before
exercise to allow for fluid absorption and urine output (146).

During a Training Session
Children and Adolescents

¢

Children weighing 88 pounds (40 kg) should drink 5 ounces (150 ml) of cold water or a flavored, salted
beverage every 20 minutes during training.

e

Adolescents weighing 132 pounds (60 kg) should drink 9 (250 ml) ounces of cold water or a flavored,
salted beverage every 20 minutes (30, 182).

Adults
e

Athletes should follow an individualized hydration plan. During prolonged activity in hot weather, they
should consume a sport drink containing 20 to 30 mEq of sodium (460-690 mg with chloride as the
anion) per liter, 2 to 5 mEq of potassium (78-195 mg) per liter, and carbohydrate in a concentration of
5% to 10%.

After Training
e

Athletes should consume adequate food and fluids, as well as sodium, to restore hydration. If dehydration
is significant or the athlete has <12 hours before the next exercise bout, a more aggressive approach
is warranted and the athlete should consume approximately 1.5 L (50 ounces) of fluid (with sufficient
electrolytes) for each kilogram of body weight lost (0.7 L or 24 ounces for each pound of body weight).

15 to20 mmol/L(1 g per 2 pints), which has been shown
to increase voluntary hydration by 90% when compared
to unflavored water (30, 182).

During Activity

After Activity

Due to large variations in sweat rates and electrolyte
concentrations, athletes should measure weight changes
during training and competition in specific weather
conditions and develop individualized hydration strategies based on this information (146). During prolonged
activity in hot weather, the IOM recommends sport
drinks containing 20 to 30 mEq of sodium (460-690
mg with chloride as the anion) per liter, 2 to 5 mEq of
potassium (78-195 mg) per liter, and carbohydrate in a
concentration of 5% to 10% (73). In addition, when a
sport drink is ingested at high rates during intense or
prolonged exercise, athletes may want to choose one
that contains multiple types of carbohydrates with dif-

After exercise, athletes should replace fluid and electrolyte losses. If time permits, normal meals, snacks
(provided that they contain some sodium), and water
will restore fluid and electrolyte losses. Additional salt
can be added to foods when sweat sodium losses are
substantial (68, 146). If dehydration is significant, or the
athlete has a short recovery period before the next bout of
exercise (<12 hours), then a more aggressive approach is
warranted: Athletes should consume approximately 1.5 L
(50 ounces) of fluid (with sufficient electrolytes) for
each kilogram of body weight loss (0.7 L or 24 ounces
for each pound of body weight). This amount of fluid
helps account for increased urine production stemming
from the consumption of a large volume of fluid (146,
155).

Prehydrate, if necessary, several hours before exercise

ferent intestinal transport mechanisms, such as glucose,

fructose, and maltodextrin. Ingestion of multiple types
of carbohydrate versus a single carbohydrate will lead
to greater gastric emptying, carbohydrate absorption,
oxidation, and possibly better performance (33, 80).
All beverages provided should be cool—10-15 °C (5059 °F)—but not cold (22).
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
periodic drinking be enforced in children. These guidelines suggest that children weighing 88 pounds (40 kg)
drink 5 ounces (148 ml) of cold water or a flavored
salted beverage every 20 minutes during practice and
that adolescents weighing 132 pounds (60 kg) drink 9
ounces (266 ml) even if they do not feel thirsty. Another
recommendation is a sodium chloride concentration of

Conclusion
Nutrition plays an important role in strength and conditioning. Adequate hydration and electrolytes, appropriate energy intake, and adequate protein, carbohydrate,
fat, vitamin, and mineral intakes allow athletes to reap

maximal benefits from training. A general understanding of nutrition principles and applications is essential
for strength and conditioning professionals so that they
can help athletes sort through nutrition misinformation
and provide sound guidelines that athletes can use to
improve their diets.
