Aerobic Power
Jonathan H. Anning, PhD, CSCS*D

Aerobic power refers to the ability of the muscles to use oxygen received
from the heart and lungs to produce energy. As this process becomes more
efficient, aerobic power improves. Therefore, improvements in aerobic
.
power are usually monitored by determining VO2max, or the maximal
volume of oxygen a person consumes and uses with the active muscles
during exercise.
Developing aerobic power is a lower training priority for athletes participating primarily in anaerobic activities (i.e., for which oxygen is not necessary for energy production) than it is for athletes participating in aerobic
activities such as long-distance events. Obviously, long-distance walking,
running, cycling, swimming, and even cross-country skiing are highly aerobic activities and thus require oxygen to produce energy. Yet, long-distance
athletic potential is not entirely related to maximal aerobic power because
improvements in anaerobic threshold result in competitive differences
among athletes (see chapter 6) (Bosquet, Léger, and Legros 2002).
Consider the fact that sedentary people can improve aerobic power by
training near the anaerobic threshold, whereas trained athletes must train
above the anaerobic threshold (Londeree 1997). Nonetheless, tests specifically designed to measure maximal aerobic power during walking, running,
cycling, or swimming competitions appear to be best suited for comparing
endurance capabilities with performance outcomes. Conversely, aerobic
power tests are not appropriate for sports performed at high intensities
because these activities are predominantly anaerobic.
Because anaerobic activities are associated with greater fatigue, the value
of aerobic power is limited to facilitating energy recovery during repeated
efforts of such activities. Although there is no set formula for determining
aerobic power needs within a sport, the repetitive high-intensity demands
combined with game duration highlights a need for anaerobic system

recovery. Sports that may require aerobic power to facilitate continuous
recovery include field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts,
downhill skiing, soccer, wrestling, and to a lesser extent, basketball and
American football (Baechle and Earle 2008). Athletes in these sports must
switch instantaneously from high- to low-intensity activities, and vice versa,
over the course of a game.
The additional challenge placed on athletes in anaerobic sports is recovery
from dependence on the anaerobic glycolytic system, which breaks down
carbohydrate to produce energy while decreasing pH levels in the body. The
decrease in pH is referred to as metabolic acidosis, and this interferes with
the athlete’s ability to continue performing at a high level. For the athlete
to overcome the fatigue associated with metabolic acidosis, the recovery
process must include removing the prohibitive by-products while replacing the energy stores. Therefore, athletes involved in interval training, or
the manipulation of exercise and rest ratios to maximize these metabolic
pathways, are improving the aerobic and anaerobic systems simultaneously.
Another aspect of anaerobic activities experienced in sport is the foundational fitness, or progression, aspect. Even though the aerobic demand
of sports such as baseball, field events, golf, and weightlifting are minimal
(Baechle and Earle 2008), the proper progression of muscle adaptations
begins with establishing a strong fitness foundation that includes cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal health components during the off-season.
Consequently, aerobic power need only be measured at the beginning and
end of the off-season to confirm an athlete’s training commitment and fitness foundation prior to preseason conditioning.
The advantage of selecting aerobic power tests for predominantly anaerobic sports is that they offer more choices, whereas individuals competing
in long-distance events are limited by the specificity principle. Choosing
aerobic power tests and protocols for endurance athletes should begin with
knowing the person’s training preferences. The next step is to ensure that
the administration of the test will meet general maximal or submaximal
assessment criteria. The primary criterion for ensuring the accuracy of the
results of a maximal aerobic power test is that the person reaches volitional
fatigue within 8 to 12 minutes. Submaximal aerobic power tests, on the
other hand, should be based on research literature recommendations for
protocol intensities that achieve a heart rate steady state (American College
of Sports Medicine 2010). The heart rate steady state is the plateau at which
the heart rate and rate of oxygen consumption tend to remain relatively
stable at a given workload. An examiner can verify steady state by measuring
the heart rate during the final two minutes of a protocol stage to determine
whether those two measurements are within six beats per minute (bpm)
of each other. Nonetheless, unless the examiner is trying to determine an
athlete’s ability to perform longer than 12 minutes, the recommendation is
to select the maximal or submaximal aerobic power test that best matches
the demands of the sport.


Aerobic Power

Tables 5.1 and 5.2 summarize the maximal and submaximal exercise
tests, respectively, described in this chapter. To facilitate the selection of
an appropriate cardiorespiratory test, population-specific correlations and
standard errors reported in the referenced literature are included in the
.
tables. Correlation coefficients between predicted and observed VO2max
values have been proposed at a minimum of .60 by Mayhew and Gifford
(1975), but it should be noted that correlations above .80 are much more
preferable (Baumgartner and Jackson 1991). In addition, a value of ±4.5
mL · kg–1 · km–1 as a standard error of estimate is considered an acceptable
range for predicting aerobic power (Dolgener et al. 1994; Greenhalgh,
George, and Hager 2001). After identifying the cardiorespiratory test that
appears to address the athlete’s goals accurately, the fitness professional
should refer to the textbook page identified in the table for more details
about the specific protocols.

Regression Equation Variables
Tables 5.1 and 5.2 consist of regression equations that require the data variables in table 5.3 to perform the calculations. Some data require little skill
to collect, such as age, height and weight, elapsed time (measured with a
stopwatch), the distance traveled on a track, the speed and grade of the belt
on the treadmill, and the cycle ergometer workload (e.g., revolutions each
minute along with resistance). Conversely, collecting other forms of data
requires technical proficiency. For instance, using the regression equation
to determine the maximal mile run for healthy youth (Buono et al. 1991)
requires a sum of skinfolds in addition to the elapsed time. Another technical proficiency is determining heart rate because it is essential for almost
all of the testing protocols, especially the submaximal testing protocols
used to measure improvements in aerobic power. Chapter 2 describes the
techniques used to measure tricep and subscapular skinfold sites. Chapter 3
describes the palpation, heart rate monitor, and electrocardiograph methods
for determining heart rate.

Maximal Exercise Testing Methods
The maximal laboratory exercise tests in table 5.1 are optimal for assessing
aerobic power because they offer the best opportunity for gas measurements. Oxygen and carbon dioxide analyzers permit the collection of gases
while facilitating the performance goal prescription and monitoring process. Although these gas analyzers have a high degree of sophistication in
measuring cardiorespiratory fitness, the technical expertise necessary for
administering and interpreting the data exceeds the scope of this chapter.
Hence, only the heart rate methods for performing a maximal exercise test

will be discussed with the assumption that the fitness professional has the
time to perform the test and the athlete is willing to provide a maximal effort.
Confirming a maximal effort is essential for improving estimates of
aerobic power. Without sophisticated analyzers to identify gas and lactate
levels at the completion of a maximal exercise test, heart rate measurements are expected to be above 70% of heart rate reserve or above 85%
of age-predicted (220 – age) heart rate maximum (American College of
Sports Medicine 2010). Although these maximal heart rate criteria provide
objectivity with relative ease, large errors of 10 to 12 bpm at all ages are
cause for concern when using the age-predicted value as a reason for test
termination or as a basis for maximal effort (American College of Sports
Medicine 2000).
The age-predicted maximal heart rate concerns arise from overestimated
younger adult and underestimated older adult values (Gellish et al. 2007). To
reduce the concern of estimating maximal heart rate, the equation HRmax =
207 – (0.7 × age) is recommended for everyone between the ages of 30 and
75 to reduce estimation errors by 5 to 8 bpm (American College of Sports
Medicine 2010; Gellish et al. 2007). Furthermore, examiners should attempt
to verify age-predicted maximal heart rate calculations by observing signs
of fatigue and performance technique deficiencies when athletes request to
stop a maximal effort test (Pettersen, Fredrikson, and Ingjer 2001). Heart
rate tests are discussed in more detail in chapter 3.
When interpreting the results of a maximal effort test, critical assumptions
must be addressed. Without calibrated equipment, examiners must rely on
the previously mentioned relationship between oxygen consumption and
heart rate, meaning that they are assuming that the heart rate increases
linearly with the workload up to maximal effort. Based on this assumption,
the accuracy of the prediction equation will be limited to specific populations
as long as the correlations are strong with low standard errors. Nevertheless,
the best alternatives to using gas measurements (i.e., oxygen and carbon
dioxide) to measure aerobic power are the maximal exercise testing methods
identified in table 5.1 (Balke and Ware 1959; Bruce, Kusumi, and Hosmer
1973; George 1996; Spackman et al. 2001; Storer, Davis, and Caiozzo 1990).

Laboratory Maximal Treadmill Tests
The treadmill and the bicycle ergometer are the most popular modes for
exercise testing in the United States and Europe (Maeder et al. 2005). The
treadmill appears to elicit higher maximal oxygen consumption values than
the bicycle ergometer (Hambrecht et al. 1992; Maeder et al. 2005; Myers
et al. 1991; Wicks et al. 1978). Higher maximal heart rates have also been
observed on the treadmill compared to the bicycle ergometer (Buchfuhrer
et al. 1983; Hambrecht et al. 1992; Wicks et al. 1978), but other studies
have found that both modes elicit comparable heart rates (Maeder et al.
2005; Myers et al. 1991). Nonetheless, the treadmill is expected to gener-

ate the highest aerobic power relative to other exercise modes regardless
of the protocol.
The Bruce and Balke–Ware treadmill protocols are most commonly used
in clinical and laboratory settings because of their high levels of predictive
accuracy and low rates of estimation errors (American College of Sports
Medicine 2010; refer to table 5.1 for comparisons). Furthermore, exercise
time to exhaustion during the Bruce and Balke protocols was determined
to be a simple indication of cardiorespiratory functions and physical fitness
capabilities (Balke and Ware 1959; Bruce, Kusumi, and Hosmer 1973).
Bruce, Kusumi, and Hosmer (1973) even differentiated between sedentary
and physically active lifestyles based on regular participation in jogging,
running games, or activities with equivalent exertion levels.
Today, the common practice when testing young and physically active
people is to use large increases in speed and grade (i.e., 2 to 3 METs), such
as during the Bruce protocol. With older, chronically diseased, or deconditioned people, smaller increments (≤1 MET per stage) are used, such as
during the Balke protocol (American College of Sports Medicine 2010).
Although the workload increments are smaller for the Balke protocol, for
some subjects (e.g., chronically diseased people), the speed may still be too
fast (i.e., 3.1 miles per hour at 0% grade) and challenging (i.e., 20 mL · kg–1
· min–1) within the first five minutes of testing.
Modified versions of the Bruce protocol do exist. For instance, one or
two preliminary stages (i.e., 1.7 miles per hour at 0% grade and 5% grade)
have been added when working with very deconditioned people or cardiac
patients. Conversely, the initial stage can be eliminated when testing wellconditioned athletes. However, these modifications are appropriate only
when using gas analyzers because the developed regression equations are
based on time to completion.

General Guidelines for Laboratory
Maximal Treadmill Tests
Once the most appropriate and accurate population-specific equation
is chosen (see table 5.1), examiners can use the following steps for
data collection:
1. Collect age, height, weight, and resting heart rate measurements.
2. Collect exercise heart rate. The heart rate is taken every minute.
3. Collect recovery heart rate for three to five minutes, and longer if
necessary to ensure the safe recovery of the subject.
.
4. Estimate the subject’s VO2max using the appropriate populationspecific equation identified in table 5.1.
.
5. Convert absolute (mL · min–1) to relative (mL · kg–1 · min–1) VO2max
by dividing mL · min–1 by the subject’s body weight in kilograms.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

6. Determine
the subject’s aerobic power by classifying the estimated
.
VO2max based on table 5.7 (p. 119).
Note: Throughout the test, the subject should be monitored and
questioned for signs (e.g., wheezing, blue or pale skin color) and
symptoms (e.g., leg cramps, dizziness, chest pain) indicating the need
to terminate the test. In addition, the examiner should make sure to
collect the heart rate upon completion of the test along with the reason
for termination.

Bruce Protocol
The examiner collects heart rate every minute of the test, but uses the total
number of minutes of the test for calculation.
1. Minutes 0-3: The subject walks at 1.7 miles per hour (2.7 km · hr-1)
at a grade of 10%.
2. Minutes 3-6: The subject walks at 2.5 miles per hour (4 km · hr-1) at
a grade of 12%.
3. Minutes 6-9: The subject jogs at 3.4 miles per hour (5.5 km · hr-1) at
a grade of 14%.
4. Minutes 9-12: The subject jogs at 4.2 miles per hour (6.8 km · hr-1)
at a grade of 16%.
5. Minutes 12-15: The subject jogs at 5.0 miles per hour (8 km · hr-1) at
a grade of 18%.
6. Minutes 15-18: The subject jogs at 5.5 miles per hour (8.9 km · hr-1)
at a grade of 20%.
7. Minutes 18-21: The subject jogs at 6.0 miles per hour (9.7 km · hr-1)
at a grade of 22%.

Balke Protocol (Males)
The examiner collects heart rate every minute of the test, but uses the total
number of minutes of the test for calculation.
1. Minutes 0-1: The subject walks at 3.3 miles per hour (5.3 km · hr-1)
at 0% grade.
2. After one minute: Increase 1% grade each minute until volitional
fatigue or maximal effort (exertion).


Aerobic Power

Balke Protocol (Females)
The examiner collects heart rate every minute of the test, but uses the total
number of minutes of the test for calculation.
1. Minutes 0–3: The subject walks at 3 miles per hour (4.8 km · hr-1) at
0% grade.
2. After three minutes: Increase 2.5% grade every three minutes until
volitional fatigue or maximal effort (exertion).

Laboratory Maximal Cycle Ergometer Tests
Laboratory cycle ergometer exercise tests are also useful for determining
cardiorespiratory endurance. However, subject unfamiliarity with stationary cycling combined with premature fatiguing during maximal efforts
results in lower aerobic power values than those generated with treadmill
testing (5 to 25% less; American College of Sports Medicine 2010). Those
who train in cycling may benefit more from this form of exercise testing.
Furthermore, the stationary bike may be more appropriate when balance
and joint injuries are a concern, because it offers a non-weight-bearing
mode of exercise with stability.
Two popular bicycle ergometer protocols (Storer-Davis and Andersen)
differ in workload increments. The American College of Sports Medicine
(2010) suggests using small increases in workload (i.e., ≤0.25 kp) for
deconditioned and elderly people, which matches the Storer-Davis protocol.
The Andersen protocol uses slightly higher increases in workload with the
likelihood of fatigue occurring 5 to 10 minutes following the start of 0.5 kp
increments. Interestingly, Jung, Nieman, and Kernodle (2001) found that
the Andersen protocol had greater error than the Storer-Davis protocol. It
should be noted that these equation comparisons were based on testing with
the Storer-Davis protocol, whereas the Andersen equation was developed
according to its relevant protocol. Nonetheless, both protocols appear to have
very low aerobic power prediction errors when compared with the Bruce
and Balke treadmill protocols, making them valid and reliable alternatives.

General Guidelines for Laboratory Maximal Cycle
Ergometer Tests
Once the most appropriate and accurate population-specific equation
is chosen (see table 5.1), examiners should use the following steps
for data collection:
1. Collect age, height, weight, resting heart rate, and blood pressure
(optional) measurements.

105

2. Collect exercise heart rate, blood pressure (optional), and rating of
perceived exertion (RPE) measurements. The heart rate is taken
every minute, whereas the blood pressure and RPE are taken during
the last minute of every three-minute stage.
3. Collect recovery heart rate and blood pressure (optional) for three
to five minutes, and longer if necessary to ensure the safe recovery
of the subject.
.
4. Estimate the subject’s VO2max using the appropriate populationspecific equation identified in table 5.1.
5. Determine
the subject’s aerobic power by classifying the estimated
.
VO2max based on table 5.7 (p. 119).
Note: The subject should be closely monitored and questioned for
signs (e.g., wheezing, blue or pale skin color) and symptoms (e.g., leg
cramps, dizziness, chest pain) requiring test termination throughout
the test, particularly during running, when excessive arm movements
can produce interfering noises that result in unreliable blood pressure
measurements (Maeder et al. 2005). All measurements should be
collected immediately at the conclusion of the test along with the reason
for terminating the test.

Storer-Davis Protocol
The examiner should collect heart rate every minute of the test, but use
the maximal workload of the test for calculation.
1. Minutes 0-4: The subject pedals at 60 rpm against 0 kp.
2. After four minutes: The subject pedals at 60 rpm and increase 0.25
kp (15 watts) each minute until volitional fatigue.

Andersen Protocol (Males)
The examiner should collect heart rate every minute of the test, but use
the maximal workload of the test for calculation.
1. Minutes 0-7: The subject pedals at 70 rpm against 1.5 kp.
2. After seven minutes: The subject pedals at 70 rpm and increase 0.5
kp (35 watts) every two minutes until volitional fatigue.

Andersen Protocol (Females)

2. After seven minutes: The subject pedals at 70 rpm and increase 0.5
kp (35 watts) every two minutes until volitional fatigue.

5K Cycle Ride
Beyond the adolescent and general populations, adult trained cyclists might
consider the 5K cycle ergometer ride, which requires timing how long it
takes to pedal that distance (Buono et al. 1996). Although the cyclist performs at a self-regulated pace, the objective is to pedal 5K as fast as possible
against a resistance calculated by dividing body weight in kilograms by 20
and multiplying the value by 0.5 kp.
1. Determine how long it takes the subject to ride 5K.
2. Minutes 0-2: The subject pedals at a self-selected pace against 1.0 kp.
3. Minutes 2-3: The subject pedals at a self-selected pace against resistance based on body weight (0.5 kp per 20 kg of body weight).
4. Minutes 3-5: The subject rests.
5. After five minutes: The subject pedals at a self-selected pace and resume
resistance based on body mass until completion of the 5K ride.

Maximal Field Tests
Maximal field tests offer practical exercise settings outside the laboratory.
Field tests are usually much easier to administer than laboratory tests, which
require more sophisticated equipment and technical expertise. Instead of
relying on laboratory measurements, maximal field tests provide aerobic
power estimates based on performance distance or time. As a result of training specificity, athletes improve their distances and times in environments
that are practical for field testing.

Timed Maximal Field Tests
There are many maximal running field tests ranging from 5 to 20 minutes.
These timed field tests require that the subject be highly motivated to run,
bike, or swim as far as possible within a designated time. Because the time
limit is the basis of these tests, the main requirement is to monitor how far
the subject travels. The examiner must be sure to observe the subject during
the entire time limit so that the distance can be determined accurately. For

107


108

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

instance, if the selected test requires the subject to travel as far as possible
in 12 minutes, a track or pool would permit continuous observation while
the subject was running, cycling, or swimming.
Cooper (1968) introduced the 12-minute run to assess aerobic power
among male U.S. Air Force officers. Even though the prediction equation
was based on the performance of officers between 17 and 52 years of age,
most of them were younger than 25; the greatest accuracy was seen in
those exceeding 1.4 miles (2.3 km) in distance (Cooper 1968). In another
study, Cooper’s run test slightly overestimated aerobic power among trained
subjects between 17 and 54 years of age, but Wyndham and others (1971)
recommended against the use of this protocol with sedentary people in
their 40s and 50s. The 5-minute run may be a viable alternative for 18to 46-year-olds of various fitness levels because it appears to provide an
accurate assessment of cardiorespiratory endurance (Berthon et al. 1997b;
Dabonneville et al. 2003).
MacNaughton and others (1990) tested competitively active high school
students’ aerobic power to compare 5- and 15-minute run tests to the Bruce
protocol. Obviously, the Bruce protocol provided the most accurate aerobic
power measurement, but the next best predictor of aerobic power was the
15-minute run, whereas the 5-minute run provided only satisfactory estimates (MacNaughton et al. 1990). Coincidentally, aerobic power estimates
made from the 15-minute run demonstrated similar correlation values
to those of the 20-minute run, which included a relatively low reported
standard error. This suggests that longer durations may be more beneficial
for high school students (Murray et al. 1993). However, motivation and
local muscular fatigue and discomfort have prompted the recommendation
of limiting maximal aerobic power tests to 8 to 10 minutes for youth and
untrained people (Massicotte, Gauthier, and Markon 1985).
All the time trial field tests discussed previously estimate aerobic power
based on performance distance, but running economy may also need to be
taken into consideration to address training efficiency. For instance, most
fitness professionals would expect performance to improve with training
specificity. However, Cooper (1968) found that repeated 12-minute run
testing resulted in minimal training effects. Therefore, Berthon and others
.
(1997a) suggest determining running speed at VO2max to evaluate running
economy. The significance of this suggestion is evidenced by the inability
to estimate aerobic power as accurately as running speed for runners and
athletes (Berthon et al. 1997a), whereas both components of running
economy are estimated accurately among the general population (Berthon et
al. 1997b). Overall, a 5-minute run appears to be too short for the accurate
estimation of running speed (Berthon et al. 1997a; 1997b).
Other maximal field test options that address training specificity are
timed swimming and road cycling. Cooper (1982) developed a 12-minute
swim and a 12-minute road cycling test. Road cycling distances are best


Aerobic Power

measured using an odometer and pedaling on a flat terrain with winds less
than 10 miles per hour (16 km/h). Swimming distances (with any stroke)
are best determined by knowing the pool dimensions. Although there are
a few equations that estimate aerobic power for swimming, the relatively
low correlations and standard errors associated with the estimates indicate a
greater value in recording the traveled distance without calculating aerobic
power. The same recommendation of recording distance measurements
applies to road cycling as well. Although nothing has been published in the
literature, these testing strategies could also be used with other endurance
activities such as cross-country skiing. Regardless of the endurance event,
changes in distances over a training period would be the basis for identifying
training effectiveness on swimming, road cycling, and skiing performance.

Distance Maximal Field Tests
Rather than base aerobic power estimates on the duration of a field test,
some fitness professionals select a maximal protocol reliant on distance.
Regardless of the mode (e.g., walking or running), the objective is to complete a specified distance within the shortest time period.
Several equations that predict aerobic power have been developed for
maximal running tests ranging from one mile to marathon distances (see
table 5.1). These distances reflect the suggestion that runners must run
farther than a mile to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness with the greatest
accuracy (Fernhall et al. 1996). During the development of running prediction equations for aerobic capacity, data suggested that at least 600 yards are
ideal for healthy populations, but a mile or farther is preferable (Cureton et
al. 1995; Disch, Frankiewicz, and Jackson 1975). Based on the specificity
principle, common sense suggests that using specific road race distances in
tests of competitive runners will result in greater accuracy. Furthermore,
Tokmakidis and others (1987) suggested that aerobic power estimation
accuracy may be improved by using two running performances under the
same conditions (i.e., health status, environment, course). Because of the
high-intensity nature of running field tests, sedentary people and those
with cardiovascular or musculoskeletal risks should not be assessed using
this all-out run approach (American College of Sports Medicine 2010).

General Guidelines for Maximal Distance and
Timed Field Tests
Once the most appropriate and accurate population-specific equation
is chosen (table 5.1), examiners can use the following steps for data
collection:
1. Collect age, height, weight, and resting heart rate measurements.
Tricep and subscapular skinfold measurements are required when
using the regression equation for the mile run to assess youth

between 10 and 18 years of age (Buono et al 1991). Chapter 2
describes the procedures for determining these skinfold measurements.
2. Have the subject perform a general warm-up using the mode of
exercise being tested.
3. Have the subject perform the activity within the specified time limit
or distance.
4. Record the distance for a timed protocol or the duration for a distance
protocol. Because aerobic power estimation accuracy is questionable with cycling and swimming field tests, performance distances
also provides a satisfactory basis for monitoring training progress.
Although the swimming and road cycling performance distances
are sufficient for assessment purposes, unconfirmed interpretation
tables are available (Cooper 1982).
.
5. Estimate the subject’s VO2max using the appropriate populationspecific equation identified in table 5.1.
6. Convert
metabolic equivalent (MET) to relative (mL · kg–1 · min–1)
.
VO2max by multiplying MET by 3.5.
7. Determine
the subject’s aerobic power by classifying the estimated
.
VO2max based on table 5.7 (p. 119).

Submaximal Exercise Testing Methods
Estimating aerobic power with submaximal exercise testing methods is
time efficient. Because most submaximal tests are completed within 6 to
12 minutes with minimal exertion, the risk of medical complications is low.
Unfortunately, extrapolating exercise prescriptions is difficult because the
testing is performed at submaximal workloads. Only the heart rate responses
observed during the submaximal testing session can be incorporated into
the exercise prescriptions confidently. Given that the observed heart rates
are only within the assessed intensities, any higher heart rates must be
assumed based on an estimated maximal heart rate (220 – age). Despite the
disadvantages of submaximal exercise testing, the multitude of protocols
available provides strong evidence that this form of testing is advantageous
to fitness professionals. This section addresses the numerous testing options,
including the treadmill, cycle ergometer, and field tests identified in table
5.2 (pp. 98–101).

Laboratory Submaximal Treadmill Tests
Once the most appropriate and accurate population-specific submaximal
treadmill equation is chosen, examiners should refer to the following protocol steps for data collection.

General Guidelines for Submaximal Treadmill Tests
Once the most appropriate and accurate population-specific equation
is chosen (see table 5.2), examiners should use the following steps
for data collection:
1. Collect age, height, weight, and resting heart rate. If administering
the walk/jog/run protocol, have the subject complete the perceived
functional ability and physical activity questions in table 5.4.
2. Collect exercise heart rate. The heart rate is taken every minute, but
the steady state heart rate collected immediately at the conclusion
of the test is used for calculation purposes.
3. Collect recovery heart rate and blood pressure (optional) for three
to five minutes, and longer if necessary to ensure the safe recovery
of the subject.
.
4. Estimate the subject’s VO2max using the appropriate populationspecific equation identified in table 5.2.
5. Determine
the subject’s aerobic power by classifying the estimated
.
VO2max based on table 5.7 (p. 119).

Single-Stage Submaximal Treadmill Protocols
Walking and jogging single-stage submaximal treadmill protocols are convenient and practical. Unfit or older people appear to get the best aerobic
power estimates using the walking submaximal treadmill protocol (Ebbeling
et al. 1991; Vehrs et al. 2007). Conversely, the jogging submaximal treadmill test is more appropriate for the relatively fit (≥35.9 mL · kg–1 · min–1)
between 18 and 29 years of age (George et al. 1993b). In 2007, Vehrs and
others added age to the aerobic power prediction equation because they
found that accuracy was improved among relatively fit (≥33.4 mL · kg–1 ·
min–1) people older than 29. Following are guidelines for performing submaximal treadmill tests; specific protocols appear immediately afterward.

Submaximal Treadmill Walking Test Protocol
1. Minutes 0–4: The subject walks at 0% grade and determines a
comfortable speed between 2 and 4.5 miles per hour (3.2 and 7.2
km · hr-1) that elicits 50 to 70% of the age-predicted (220 – age)
maximal heart rate.
2. Minutes 4–8: Increase to 5% grade and maintain speed during the first
four minutes. The four- to eight-minute pace should elicit 50 to 70%
of the age-predicted maximal heart rate (use post-HR in equation).


Aerobic Power

Submaximal Treadmill Jogging Test Protocol
(Males)
1. Minutes 0–2: The subject jogs at 0% grade and determines a comfortable speed between 4.3 and 7.5 miles per hour (7 and 12 km · hr -1).
2. Minutes 2–5: The subject maintains the jogging speed established
during the first two minutes. The two- to five-minute pace should not
exceed 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate (use post-HR in
equation).

Submaximal Treadmill Jogging Test Protocol
(Females)
1. Minutes 0–2: The subject jogs at 0% grade and determines a comfortable speed between 4.3 and 6.5 miles per hour (7 and 10.5 km · hr -1).
2. Minutes 2–5: The subject maintains the jogging speed established
during the first two minutes. The two- to five-minute pace should not
exceed 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate (use post-HR in
equation).

Multistage Submaximal Treadmill Protocols
Although a multistage submaximal treadmill protocol may last longer than
the single-stage walking and jogging treadmill protocols, George and others
(2009) developed a walk/jog/run protocol that offers an opportunity to
educate athletes. In addition to performing the exercise test, subjects answer
the perceived functional ability and physical activity questions in table 5.4.
The multistage submaximal treadmill exercise protocol ends at the completion of the stage in which 70 to 90% of the age-predicted (220 – age)
maximal heart rate is achieved during walking for the lower fitness level,
jogging for the average fitness level, and running for the higher fitness level.
Furthermore, subjects classify themselves as walkers, joggers, or runners
with the perceived functional ability questions, which helps with the selection of training exercises. The subject’s previous six-month physical activity
rating then permits the fitness professional to discuss realistic training habits.
Athletes’ responses on the perceived functional ability and physical activity questionnaire (table 5.4) are incorporated into the multistage treadmill
equation in table 5.2 to estimate aerobic power. When subjects’ performances on the treadmill are different from their perceptions of their capabilities, the fitness professional has an opportunity to discuss the relationships
between training and physiological responses. This empowers the subject
while helping the fitness professional design a cardiorespiratory training
program based on realistic goals. Overall, the walk/jog/run submaximal
treadmill protocol relates the subject’s perceptions to personal exercise

performance, enabling the fitness professional to teach about choosing safe
exercise modes and training at effective intensities to achieve realistic goals
(George et al. 2009).

Submaximal Walk/Jog/Run Protocol
1. Minutes 0–4: The subject walks at 0% grade and determines a comfortable speed between 3 and 4 miles per hour (4.8 and 6.4 km · hr-1)
within the initial 20 seconds. (End the test at this stage if the subject
is within 70 to 90% of the age-predicted [220 – age] maximal heart
rate and use the treadmill speed in the equation.)
2. Minutes 4–8: The subject jogs at 0% grade and determines a comfortable speed between 4.1 and 6 miles per hour (6.6 and 9.7 km · hr-1)
within the initial 20 seconds. (End the test at this stage if the subject
is within 70 to 90% of the age-predicted [220 – age] maximal heart
rate and use the treadmill speed in the equation.)
3. Minutes 8–12: The subject runs at 0% grade and determines a comfortable speed above 6 miles per hour (9.7km · hr-1) within the initial 20
seconds. (The final stage should elicit 70 to 90% of the age-predicted
[220–age] maximal heart rate and use the treadmill speed in the equation.)

Laboratory Submaximal Cycle Ergometer Tests
Although both maximal and submaximal laboratory cycle ergometer tests
raise concerns about training specificity, submaximal tests may have a greater
standard error in predicting aerobic power than maximal tests do. Therefore,
special attention needs to be paid to the protocol’s pedal cadence and the
position of the legs during the downstroke. When the lower extremity is
straightened at the bottom of the pedaling revolution, the knee angle should
be at 5º of flexion for the greatest muscle efficiency (American College of
Sports Medicine 2010). Achieving this knee angle requires an adjustment
to the proper seat height beforehand.
A review of the research on Åstrand and YMCA submaximal bike tests
highlights the aerobic power estimation concerns with these protocols. In
1954, Åstrand and Ryhming developed a nomogram to estimate aerobic
power from a six-minute single-stage protocol for well-trained males and
females. After exploring various workloads, they discovered that the greatest accuracy occurred at 900 kg · min–1 (150 watts) for females and 1,200
kg · min–1 (200 watts) for males. Figure 5.1 provides the current Åstrand
nomogram that has been modified with an age correction factor (Åstrand
1960). To differentiate fitness levels among males, Cink and Thomas (1981)
found that the Åstrand age correction factor must be used to improve the
accuracy of the test.

Golding, Myers, and Sinning (1989) introduced the multistage YMCA
submaximal bike test, which also provides an opportunity to adjust workloads to accommodate various fitness levels. When both submaximal protocols were compared, the YMCA protocol (r = .73) was more accurate in
estimating aerobic power than the Åstrand protocol was (r = .56) among
physically active people (Kovaleski et al. 2005). A comparison of the YMCA
submaximal bike test and the Bruce protocol revealed that the YMCA test

underestimated aerobic power values by 14% (Dabney and Butler 2006).
These findings indicate that these submaximal bike tests should be limited
to trained females and physically active males.
Alternatives are available to fitness professionals working with untrained
people. Siconolfi and others (1982) modified the Åstrand submaximal bike
test and developed a regression equation based on the nomogram and age
for inactive men and women. Another accommodation was to adjust the
traditional pedal rate of 50 rpm even though it was well within the recommended pedaling frequency range of 40 to 70 rpm for optimal economy
(Åstrand and Rodahl 1986). Sharkey (1988) suggested that pedaling against
high resistance at 50 rpm is not easy for untrained people; they perform
better at 60 to 70 rpm.

General Guidelines for Submaximal Cycle Ergometer Tests
Once the most appropriate and accurate population-specific submaximal
cycle ergometer equation is chosen (see table 5.2), examiners should
use the following protocol steps for data collection:
1. Collect age, height, weight, and resting heart rate measurements.
2. Collect exercise heart rate. The heart rate is taken every minute, but
the steady state heart rate collected immediately at the conclusion
of each stage (YMCA protocol) or at the end of the test is used for
calculation purposes.
3. Collect recovery heart rate for three to five minutes, and longer if
necessary to ensure the safe recovery of the subject.

4. Estimate the subject’s VO2max using the appropriate populationspecific equation identified in table 5.2.
.
5. Convert absolute (L · min–1) to relative (mL · kg–1 · min–1) VO2max
by dividing L · min–1 by the subject’s body weight in kilograms and
multiplying the value by 1,000.
6. Determine
the subject’s aerobic power by classifying the estimated
.
VO2max based on table 5.7 (p. 119).

YMCA Submaximal Bike Test
1. Warm-up: The subject pedals at 50 rpm against 0 kp.
2. Stage 1: The subject pedals at 50 rpm against 0.5 kp (25 watts) and
continues the stage for three minutes or longer to achieve steady state
HR.
3. Stage 2: The subject pedals at 50 rpm for three minutes at modified
resistance based on table 5.5.
4. Additional stages (if necessary): If the steady state HR is not between
110 and 150 bpm for stage 1 and stage 2, the subject continues pedaling at 50 rpm and increases 0.5 kp (25 watts) every three minutes or
longer to achieve steady state HR. While the speed is maintained at
50 rpm, the resistance will continue to be increased 0.5 kp (25 watts)
for as many stages as necessary to achieve a steady state HR within
110 to 150 bpm for two stages. When within 110 to 150 bpm, the
two stages’ corresponding heart rates and workloads are then used
to determine aerobic power based on the YMCA bike test equation
found in table 5.2.

Åstrand Submaximal Bike Test (Males)
1. Minutes 0–3: The subject pedals at 50 rpm against 0 kp.
2. Test: Apply resistance according to table 5.6, and have the subject
pedal at 50 rpm for six minutes or longer to achieve steady state HR
within the 130 to 170 bpm range.
3. Additional stage (if necessary): If the test HR is less than 130 bpm, the
subject pedals at 50 rpm and increases 1 to 2 kp (50–100 watts) for an
additional six minutes or longer to achieve steady state HR between
130 and 170 bpm. When the subject is within the 130 to 170 bpm
range, the immediate postexercise HR and final workload are used in
the nomogram.

to 170 bpm. When the subject is within the 125 to 170 bpm range,
the immediate postexercise HR and final workload are used in the

steps for data collection:

Quarter-mile to 2-kilometer (1.25 miles) submaximal walking distances
are possible protocol selections for people of all ages, but low-fit people
and those whose training regimen consists of walking appear to be the best
suited for this mode of field testing. For instance, elderly people and those
with physical limitations (e.g., overweight, obese, mentally impaired, cardiopulmonary patients) tend to be assessed using walking tests (Larsen et
al. 2002; McSwegin et al. 1998). Conversely, underestimations in aerobic
power are common with highly trained people performing these submaximal walking protocols because the cardiorespiratory system is inadequately

challenged (Kline et al. 1987). Anyone who cannot achieve a heart rate
above 110 bpm when walking briskly would be considered highly trained
(George, Fellingham, and Fisher 1998).
Another approach that goes beyond determining the duration of a submaximal field test is measuring the final heart rate after walking or jogging a
mile (1.6 km) (Dolgener et al. 1994; George et al. 1993a; Kline et al. 1987).
Note that the mile jog must take longer than eight minutes for males and
nine minutes for females, and subjects must maintain a heart rate below
180 bpm for the test to qualify as submaximal (George et al. 1993a).

Regression Equation Calculations
In addition to being skilled at collecting data, fitness professionals also must
understand the order of operations to perform regression equation calculations. A common technique for remembering the order of operations is the
abbreviation PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. The phrase Please Excuse
My Dear Aunt Sally is helpful for remembering the order of the letters. When
performing calculations, the order of operations refers to a ranking order:
(1) parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division working from
left to right, and (4) addition and subtraction working from left to right.
As an example, we explore the process of determining aerobic power after
selecting the submaximal treadmill walk/jog/run protocol and regression
equation. Consider the following four-step process:

119


120

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

1. Heart rate is taken during the submaximal treadmill walk/jog/run
protocol. A heart rate monitor or electrocardiograph would facilitate the
process because of the difficulty of palpating a moving arm during exercise.
The purpose of monitoring the heart rate is to determine when a steady
state is achieved. The heart rate steady state is the plateau at which the
heart rate and rate of oxygen consumption tend to remain relatively stable
at a given workload. The examiner can verify steady state, which is optimal
for any submaximal test, by determining that the heart rate on the monitor
or electrocardiogram is within 6 bpm of each other (American College of
Sports Medicine 2010) during the final two minutes of the walking, jogging,
and running protocol stages. Even if a steady state is not achieved at the
end of the protocol stage, the subject progresses from walking to jogging to
running every four minutes until the heart rate falls between 70 and 90%
of the age-predicted (220 – age) maximum, which establishes the treadmill
speed that will be used in the regression equation. In addition to performing the exercise test, the subject answers perceived functional ability and
physical activity questions (table 5.4). The age and weight of the subject
must also be known. Here are some results from the submaximal treadmill
walk/jog/run protocol to perform the regression equation calculations:
Age = 40 years
Weight (wgt) = 70 kg
Running treadmill speed (miles per hour) = 7 miles per hour
Perceived functional ability (PFA) = 24
Physical activity (PA) = 8
2. Aerobic power calculations require using the preceding information
in the following regression equation for males:
Aerobic power = 30.04 + 6.37 – 0.243 (age) – 0.122 (wt) + 3.2 (mph)
+ 0.391 (PFA) + 0.669 (PA)
Aerobic power = 30.04 + 6.37 – 0.243 (40) – 0.122 (70) + 3.2 (7) +
0.391 (24) + 0.669 (8)
Aerobic power = 30.04 + 6.37 – 9.72 – 8.54 + 22.4 + 9.384 + 5.352
Aerobic power = 55.3 mL · kg–1 · min–1
3. Aerobic power interpretations are based on the cardiorespiratory
fitness levels presented in table 5.7. Within the table, the aerobic power
is expressed relative to body weight (mL · kg–1 · min–1), which means that
55 mL · kg–1 · min–1 is classified as athletic. Be aware that absolute (L ·
km–1 or mL · min–1) and metabolic (MET) values need to be converted to
relative body weight to use the table. In addition, although classifying the
subject may be a goal, the ultimate goal should be to use the aerobic power
estimations to improve cardiorespiratory fitness with appropriate exercise
prescription strategies.


Aerobic Power

121

4. Exercise prescription for developing aerobic power is based on
assessments. Whether fitness professionals are determining a baseline or
training cardiorespiratory fitness level, interpretation of the aerobic power
value will enable them to monitor training specificity. Specificity refers to
the principle that the body adapts according to the stimuli it is exposed to
during exercise. For example, swimmers train in the water and become very
efficient at swimming, but this does not mean they will be good at running
or cycling. Nonetheless, as a result of endurance training specificity, aerobic
power is expected to improve 5 to 30% regardless of the mode (American
College of Sports Medicine 2006). Therefore, a well-selected aerobic power
protocol should permit the fitness professionals to monitor and adjust an
athlete’s training program to accomplish realistic goals based on ongoing
assessment results.

Professional Applications

Owing to the large variety of cardiorespiratory endurance tests available, fitness
professionals must be knowledgeable about them and capable of selecting
the best test for assessing an athlete’s aerobic power. Proper test selection
depends on understanding the physiological and biomechanical principles of
a sport or activity while applying the evidence-based research to the athlete’s
capabilities. Therefore, the maximal (table 5.1) and submaximal (table 5.2)
tests presented in this chapter have been organized into SMARTS charts to
explore the science and art of exercise selection.
SMARTS stands for Specificity, Mode, Application, Research, and Training
Status (see tables 5.8 and 5.9). First, the fitness professional must know the
specific metabolic demands of the sport or activity—that is, whether it is predominantly aerobic or anaerobic physiologically. Maximal tests might be more
appropriate for sports or activities emphasizing aerobic metabolism, whereas
submaximal tests might be best suited for athletes primarily dealing with anaerobic training. Obviously, sports or activities that alternate between aerobic and
anaerobic metabolic demands may use either maximal or submaximal tests.
Second, the fitness professional must select an exercise mode that best
matches the athlete’s training or competitive activity. For instance, a cycle
ergometer test might be appropriate for an American football lineman because
the athlete must be able to sustain or overcome forces against resistance
during an entire game.
Third, the fitness professional must determine whether an aerobic power
test would provide applicable information. Referring to the previous example,
by determining the aerobic power of the athlete, the coach would have a basis
for deciding future training strategies along with duration recommendations for
keeping the football lineman in the game without a break.

Fourth, the fitness professional should refer to the research for populationspecific correlations and standard errors to ensure that the selection is evidence based. Because the anaerobic football lineman would be performing a
submaximal cycle ergometer test, research appears to favor the YMCA protocol
over the Åstrand protocol.
Fifth, the fitness professional must take into account the athlete’s training
status. Even though the YMCA protocol may be more accurate in estimating
aerobic power, the traditional or modified Åstrand protocol might be more
appropriate if the football lineman is untrained after a long off-season.


Aerobic Power

Fitness professionals should keep in mind that these are only examples of
how to use the SMARTS charts; no one method is best for assessing all football
linemen or any other types of athletes. Nonetheless, specificity, mode, application, research, and training status all play valuable roles in the selection of an
appropriate aerobic power test.
Once they have chosen the aerobic power test, fitness professionals must
determine the data variables they need to collect. Based on the variables, any
skills that need to be developed should be addressed prior to the testing session.
Otherwise, undeveloped skills may require the selection of an alternative testing
option. Fitness professionals should practice the skills prior to the testing session regardless of their proficiency, especially if time has elapsed since they last
performed the test on an athlete.
After collecting the data and calculating the aerobic power estimate, fitness
professionals have a foundational cardiorespiratory fitness level for prescribing an individualized training program. This will result in realistic training goals
that may maintain or improve the athlete’s aerobic power. In addition, fitness
professionals should remember that improvements in aerobic power require
sustained activities near or above anaerobic threshold; these assessments
are presented in the next chapter.

The proper selection and administration of a protocol are essential
because they affect the accuracy of the results of the cardiorespiratory
fitness test. Tests are chosen based on equipment availability, technical
expertise, and available time, and they should be population specific
while providing the least amount of error in estimating aerobic power.
If multiple cardiorespiratory fitness tests are applicable to an athlete,
the fitness professional may be able to reduce the standard error by
comparing two or more options.
Knowledge of the athlete’s training program exercises prior to testing will allow the fitness professional to make adaptations to address
the specificity of the exercise, which will facilitate the selection of
an appropriate cardiorespiratory assessment protocol. Regardless,
interpreting aerobic power for cardiorespiratory fitness will be based
on careful considerations that ensure the test protocol accurately
identifies training adaptations and exercise program effectiveness.
