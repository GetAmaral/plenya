Effective exercise prescription begins with an analysis to determine the
needs of the client. Referred to as a needs analysis (National Strength and
Conditioning Association 2000), this process involves determining the client’s lifestyle and the demands of the sport, as well as identifying current
and previous injuries and limitations, overall training experience, and the
existing level of fitness and skill across a variety of fitness and athletic components. Without such data from which to provide baseline and follow-up
evaluations, trainers and strength and conditioning professionals are inclined
to design and implement cookie-cutter exercise programs created not for
the individual, but for a large group of potential exercisers.
Conducting tests and assessing the collected data provides objective information regarding the strengths and weaknesses in a client’s physiological and
functional capacities. When done correctly, this process enables an exercise
professional to develop the most effective and appropriate training program
for the client. However, the process involves far more than simply collecting
data. Gathering the appropriate data, analyzing it correctly, and presenting
the information in a succinct and accurate manner are all important for the
effective use of testing in a fitness or sport arena.

Sport Performance and Testing
Tests are conducted for a variety of reasons depending on the situation.
Following are some examples in a professional setting:

Identifying physiological strengths and weaknesses
Ranking people for selection purposes
Predicting future performances
Evaluating the effectiveness of a training program or trial
Tracking performance over time
Assigning and manipulating training dosages (e.g., intensities, loads,
volumes)

Exercise professionals can evaluate data to examine the overall effectiveness of an exercise routine. Specifically, strength testing data collected every
month can be used to examine changes over time and to give an objective
picture of the overall effectiveness of the strength training plan. If increases
in strength are less than desirable, alterations may be made to enhance fitness adaptation during the subsequent training cycle.
Personal trainers may use test data to demonstrate and present improvements to clients and help them gain an understanding of the overall picture
of the alterations in fitness brought about by their exercise programs. Alternatively, physical therapists might consult test data to determine appropriate rehabilitation progression timelines. When used properly, test data can
help exercise professionals reach and maintain a higher level of practice.

Screening Tests
The first step in selecting components to include in the test battery is to
determine the physiological components to be evaluated. Specific to the
needs analysis, a preliminary assessment should include several additional
tests to determine the client’s exercise readiness. Depending on the client,
this step requires a careful examination of potential sources of physical
complications; this might involve a cardiovascular screening or an assessment of joint and posture mobility or integrity. Regardless of the client’s age
and training history, this pre-activity screening is a vital step in the needs
analysis, and is necessary for identifying potential health risks of engaging in
exercise, prior to the start of a program. Clearly, tests conducted to identify
health risks are somewhat different from those used to simply gauge and
monitor basic fitness. Nonetheless, these tests are all needed for creating
effective programming and ensure client safety.
After the completion of a health risk appraisal, testing for current fitness is likely warranted. For personal trainers, this process is relatively
straightforward, involving a thorough review of the client’s health history


Tests, Data Analysis, and Conclusions

and current health risk, as well as exercise and fitness goals. For strength
and conditioning professionals, this step requires an intimate understanding of not only the tests needed for evaluating athlete preparedness, but
also the fitness and performance benchmarks for that athlete to aspire to,
to compete successfully in a given athletic endeavor.
To complete the testing process in a time- and energy-efficient manner,
fitness professionals need to ensure that the tests are valid—that is, that they
measure what they are intended to measure. A strength test should measure
force production, whereas an endurance test should measure the ability to
repeatedly exert force. From the many tests that have been developed and
validated to measure specific health and fitness components, fitness professionals must select the most appropriate and valid one for a given client.
They need to keep in mind that certain tests have been validated only for
specific populations and may not be appropriate for people who are not in
that classification. Therefore, caution must be used when selecting tests,
because producing invalid results is very easy to do.
Tests must not only measure what they are supposed to measure, but
also measure it consistently. Reliable tests result in consistent measures
with a low opportunity for error. When using external raters or observers
to measure performance measures, examiners should consider the reliability of each observer. To compare future test results to baseline results,
fitness professionals must either ensure that the same observer conducts
both tests or that multiple observers provide the same measure for a given
performance. To verify consistency among raters, examiners can have all
raters assess the same performance; this might reveal differences in ratings,
or the extent of such differences.
Although many tests have been shown to be valid and reliable in a clinical
or laboratory setting, some are not feasible in many work environments.
Financial resources, time and space, as well as qualified staff to oversee
testing are all factors that may determine the practicality of a specific test.
However, examiners should consider alternatives for testing, because there
are often multiple options for determining specific fitness and performance
characteristics.
Validity, reliability, and feasibility should be the foremost considerations
in test selection. Professionals who take all of these variables into account
will get better, more useful information throughout their careers.

Data Evaluation and Statistical Analysis
Data collection represents only half of the overall process of testing and
assessment. Once testing has been completed, data evaluation and interpretation must be conducted. Many fitness professionals are very good at
conducting tests and storing information. However, where they frequently
fall short is in the actual evaluation of the information they have collected,

3

as well as in the subsequent use of those findings to inform their exercise
prescriptions. Without an objective examination of the data, the full value
of exercise testing cannot be realized.

Applied Statistics
Many fitness professionals view statistics as complex, useless mathematical
equations. Although many complex equations and statistical procedures
exist, and some of them do lack professional applications, applied statistics
can offer an objective means for evaluating data. Developing a functional
knowledge of statistics may require an investment of time and effort; however, the ability to perform even the most basic applied statistical analyses
will greatly add to the fitness professional’s toolbox of skills.
In statistics, very little emphasis is placed on one piece of data (e.g., one
client’s vertical jump score or one athlete’s bench press 1RM). Instead, statistical evaluations focus on group dynamics. For instance, if one person
in a group of 10 decreased performance after participating in an organized
training program, but the other nine participants increased performance,
we would not want to judge the program as ineffective simply because one
person in the group did not experience a positive response. Yet, in the world
of exercise prescription and programming, we must consider the individual
responses. Although one treatment may work well for a large population,
it may not be the most effective for a given person. However, if only one
client improves, or if one client improves much more than the others do,
promoting the training program as effective based on that one person is
inappropriate (although many fitness professionals do this). Care is needed
when applying statistical evaluations in the real world.

Probability Versus Magnitude
Two characteristics of collected data must be considered and understood
when performing statistical evaluations. The first is the probability of the
results. Probability represents the reproducibility of the findings and is presented as a probability value (α or the p value). This value can range from
0.0 to 1.0 in the research literature, and is often reported as p ≥ or ≤ 0.05.
Further, this value represents the chance that the findings of the analysis
were obtained erroneously. If the p value is equal to 0.05, then there is
only a 5% risk of error and a 95% chance that the same findings would be
achieved if the conditions were repeated.
The level of probability needed for reaching the predetermined significance level is set based on the amount of acceptable error. In medical
research, in which decisions about drugs or treatment protocols carry lifealtering consequences, less risk of error is allowed; α levels of .01 are generally used. In exercise science, in which differences in training programs or
routines do not carry life-threatening consequences, it is common to accept


Tests, Data Analysis, and Conclusions

levels of error at the 0.05 level. In either case, it is important to remember
that the α level represents how many times we would expect different
results if the study were repeated 100 times.
Probability is based on statistical power (most influenced by the number
of people in the group being studied) and the variation in performance
among the group. Although it is important to evaluate the reproducibility
of a statistical analysis, it provides no measure of the actual magnitude of
the change(s) in data. For instance, if 1,000 people were tested on the bench
press 1RM, and then subsequently trained for three months to specifically
improve bench press strength, examiners need to take into consideration
the sample size and its influence on probability values to predict statistical difference, as well as the interpretation of the findings. If these people
were retested and, as a group, demonstrated a 1-kilogram improvement in
strength, the probability of generating the same results if the conditions were
repeated would be high, because of the large number of participants in the
group: perhaps even at p <0.01. Assuming that this group was composed
of members of the general population, even though a 1-kilogram improvement would be expected 99 times out of 100, and would therefore likely
yield a statistically significant result, this improvement actually represents
a very small increase in strength. Therefore, because it is not uncommon
for average exercisers to see an increase of up to 15 kilograms in a threemonth period, these findings would be clinically insignificant.
Ultimately, to describe and evaluate the magnitude of the improvement,
we must rely on another calculation, usually the effect size (described later).
The differences in these outputs must be understood because many errors
have been made as a result of the incorrect assumption that probability is
equal to magnitude.

Descriptive Analysis
The first step in evaluating a data set simply provides an overview of the
data. This is done by calculating descriptive values such as the mean, median,
mode, range, and variance. The average score (mean), which is calculated
by summing all scores and dividing by the number of scores, represents the
average score. The median represents the middle score and can be found
by arranging scores in ascending order and finding the middle score. This
represents the 50th percentile score, signifying that half of the scores fall
above this score and half fall below it. The mode is the most frequently
occurring score. These three measures of central tendency provide ample
information for interpreting how a given subject’s score compares to those
of the group.
Measures of central tendency are often used to create normative data,
calculated from tests conducted in a very large group. For instance, if we
tested a group of 10,000 firefighters to see how many push-ups and sit-ups
they can perform, and then calculated the average for the group (e.g., 50 in

5

one minute), we could state that the norm for a firefighter is 50. We could
then test other firefighters to see how they compared to the normative
score measured in a larger group of firefighters. Although normative data
provide a good comparison to peers, they provide no information regarding
individuals’ ability to perform a certain task. Do firefighters need to be able
to perform 50 push-ups in one minute to do the job safely and effectively?
Do they need to be able to do 100 push-ups in one minute? Measures of
central tendency simply describe the typical performance of a group; they
do not necessarily represent the optimal level of performance.
Another important consideration in comparing an individual’s score to
those of the group is the evaluation of the variability in the scores. As one
example, a data range may be used (i.e., the high score minus the low score)
to see how much of a spread exists among all scores. Another common measure of variability is the standard deviation, which is a calculation of how
closely the data set clusters around the mean. In a normal distribution, in
which scores are evenly distributed above and below the mean, 68.26% of
all scores will fall within ±1 standard deviation from the mean, 95.44% will
fall within ±2 standard deviations, and 99.74% will fall within ±3 standard
deviations. Examining a single score, and subsequently determining how
many standard deviations above or below the mean it falls, offers a greater
perspective on the quality of that score.

Relationships Among Performance Variables
The ability to examine the relationship among variables is often of interest to
exercise professionals. The way one variable changes in relation to another
can provide valuable information. For instance, as cardiorespiratory fitness
increases, the risk of heart disease decreases. This relationship has led to a
greater focus on cardiorespiratory fitness promotion and the development
of effective exercise programs.
Although a relationship among variables can be useful information, it is
important to realize that such relationships do not represent a cause-andeffect situation. For instance, a strong correlation exists between shoe size
and IQ: people with larger shoe sizes also tend to have higher IQ scores.
However, having big feet does not impart intelligence. This relationship
simply reflects the fact that as people grow and mature, they gain knowledge.
The correlation coefficient can be used to determine a linear relationship among variables. Consider the hypothetical relationship between
body weight and vertical jump in the 10 subjects presented in table 1.1
and figure 1.1.
As body weight increases, gravitational force increases, making it more
difficult to propel the body vertically. Therefore, people who are heavier
are at a disadvantage. In the data provided, the correlation coefficient is r
= –0.85. This calculation is made in the following way:

in which

The strength and direction of the relationship are important considerations when evaluating data. The strength of the correlation is determined

by comparing the value to a scale ranging from 0 to 1.0 (see table 1.2;
Morrow et al. 2000). The most frequently used statistic to evaluate the
relationship between two variables on interval or ratio scales (e.g., the
relationship between body weight in kilograms and vertical jump height
in inches) is the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient. Calculation of the correlation coefficient relies on variance in both sets of data
being analyzed for covariation (i.e., the degree to which the two variables
change together). When two variables covary, they may be correlated to
each other positively or negatively, which is indicated by a +/– designation. For the purposes of data interpretation, a larger correlation value (i.e.,
closer to 1.0 or –1.0) represents a stronger underlying association. Higher
magnitudes of one variable occurring with higher magnitudes of another,
and lower magnitudes on both variables, is a demonstration of a positive
correlation. Conversely, two variables may covary inversely or oppositely,
such as with a negative correlation (i.e., the higher magnitudes of one variable correspond with the lower magnitudes of the other, and vice versa).
Thus, the relationship between weight and vertical jump from the sample
data represents a strong negative correlation.

Differences Among Performance Variables
Determining differences among performance variables is often an important
use of data collection and analysis. A variety of ways are available to objectively determine whether differences exist and to examine the magnitude of
the actual difference. The technique used depends on the circumstances of
testing. Examples of times when determining differences among measures
might be desirable include a coach wanting to know whether athletes’
strength levels are increasing, a physical therapist comparing two treatment
strategies to see which is more effective, a trainer comparing changes in
jump performance following a plyometric training program, and a researcher
wanting to know the difference in performance level between major and
minor league baseball players.
If the same group is compared, with measures taken before and after
an intervention, a paired-samples t-test or a repeated measures analysis of
variance would be used to examine changes. If different groups are placed
on separate interventions, an independent-samples t-test or analysis of
variance can be used. The statistical analysis evaluates the difference in


Tests, Data Analysis, and Conclusions

scores and the variability between subjects or groups, as well as provides a
probability value to help determine how consistently the measured difference could be expected. Examining the overall variability of the scores is
important because, generally speaking, there will be individual differences
within and between groups. However, it is important to determine whether
those differences might be inferred to a larger population.
Determining the magnitude of the difference in performance measures
is also important. If we simply calculate the change in the performance
score (posttest minus pretest), and then calculate the average increase for
the group, we get a crude measure of this magnitude. However, if one or
several members of the group increase or decrease at a level much different
from that of the rest of the group, the average increase may be misleading.
For instance, if we measured bench press 1RM before and after a 12-week
training program in a group of 10 clients, and then calculated the average
increase in weight lifted, we would have a measure of the magnitude of
the change. However, what if one client increased by 50 pounds (23 kg),
while every other member of the group increased by only 5 pounds (2.3
kg)? The average increase for the whole group would be 10 pounds (4.5
kg). The large increase by one client doubled the consistent increase of 5
pounds (2.3 kg) by all other members of the group. Most likely, the correct
magnitude of change would be approximately 5 pounds (2.3 kg), and the
data from one client caused a skewed result.
This inconsistent increase in the one client may be the result of a difference in the starting point. If nine clients in the group started the program
with a maximal bench press of approximately 300 pounds (136 kg) and a
lengthy training background, and one client began at 100 pounds (45 kg)
and a minimal training background, the potential for improvement in the
one client is much greater. One way to deal with this confounding variable is to calculate percentage increases by dividing the difference in preand posttests by the pretest, and then multiplying the outcome by 100. A
50-pound (23 kg) increase in a client starting at 100 pounds (45 kg) would
be equal to a 50% increase. A 5-pound (2.3 kg) increase by someone who
started at 300 pounds (136 kg) represents a 2% increase. Although we have
now considered the different starting points of the clients, the calculation of
percentage increase actually makes the problem worse in this case. Without
considering the variation in improvements, we risk skewing the results and
making incorrect decisions regarding the test data.
One way to calculate group improvement in a way that considers the
variation in improvement is to use effect size—a standardized value that
depicts the improvements in performance in a group. Cohen (1988) suggested one method that may be of particular value for fitness professionals:
calculating the mean absolute improvement in performance and dividing
it by the standard deviation of the pretest. Referring back to the discussion of descriptive analysis, we can calculate the means for the pretest and

post-test, along with the standard deviation of the pretest, and use the following calculation to determine the magnitude of the change:
(Posttest mean – pretest mean) / pretest standard deviation

The outcome data, which are provided as standard deviation units, can be
compared across groups. Several scales have been suggested to compare the
calculated effect size. This determines the relative size of the effect. Cohen
(1988) developed a scale (table 1.3) based on research in psychology with
ranges depicting small, moderate, and large effects. Another scale (table
1.4), created specifically to evaluate strength development (Rhea 2004), can
be useful for examining the magnitude of strength improvement among
populations.

Normalizing Fitness Data
Field tests have become popular in applied exercise science and sport performance enhancement programs because of their simplicity and ability
to generalize results. However, numerous confounding factors may influence the validity of test data from such evaluations. In addition to gender,
age, level of physical fitness, and skill, body size is well recognized as a
factor that influences both muscle fitness and the outcome of a number of
functional performance tests (e.g., strength testing, vertical jump, sprint
speed). Therefore, adjusting for body mass appears to be necessary when
assessing these functional characteristics, especially when comparing to a
norm-referenced standard (i.e., peer group).
For muscular strength capacity, the simplest way to normalize data is
to divide strength by body mass. This ratio method provides a straightforward index of relative muscular strength abilities and is often considered
superior to measuring absolute strength, especially when determining the
contribution(s) to explosive movement performance (Peterson, Alvar,
and Rhea 2006). It is important to note that this method is based on the
assumption that the relationship between strength and body mass is linear.
However, some research has demonstrated that the relationship between
strength and body mass tests may not be linear, but is, instead, curvilinear.
Other ways to normalize strength are used in powerlifting (Wilks Formula)
and Olympic-style weightlifting (Sinclair Formula), and allow the identification of a strength composite index relative to body mass. These formulas

minimize the risk of handicapping or recompensing the bigger athlete and
smaller athlete, respectively, and provide for an equitable competitive environment. However, as in strength and conditioning for large team sports, it
is often necessary to compare numerous people of differing body masses.
Research pertaining to dimensional scaling suggests that such comparisons
of muscular strength attributes among people of variable body sizes should
be expressed relative to body mass, raised to the power of 0.67—for example, (kg lifted) / (kg body weight)0.67 (Jaric, Mirkov, and Markovic 2005).
Known as allometric scaling, this statistical transformation of the raw data
is used to provide the appropriate relationship between body mass and the
strength outcome of interest.
Allometric scaling is derived from the theory of geometric similarity and
assumes that humans have the same basic shape, yet may still differ in size.
Other investigations have demonstrated different requisite scaling exponents
for performance in activities not related to maximal force production (e.g.,
aerobic power). Regardless of the performance outcome being assessed,
allometric scaling is based on several assumptions, including the following:
■■

■■

■■

The relationship between body dimension (usually body mass, lean
body mass, or muscle cross-sectional area) and performance is curvilinear.
The relationship between performance (P) and body size (S) may be
assessed by the equation: P = aSb, where a and b are the constant
multipliers and scaling exponent, respectively (Nevill, Ramsbottom,
and Williams 1992).
The curvilinear relationship must pass through the origin of both
variables (e.g., an athlete with no lean body mass would have a
strength score of 0).

Solving for the scaling exponent (b) allows for the removal of individual
differences in the scaling factor (S) (i.e., body size) on the performance
outcome (P) (e.g., strength).
Allometric scaling is necessary for any outcome in which body dimension
and respective performance do not share a linear relationship. If strength
and body mass shared a linear association, the scaling exponent would be

11


12

equal to 1 (b = 1), and the aforementioned ratio method would sufficiently
characterize relative strength­—that is, (kg lifted) / (kg body weight)1.
However, because this is not the case, a correction factor must be applied
to accurately report or examine body mass–adjusted strength. Ultimately,
using the correct scaling equation for a specific sample population for a
particular performance-based test minimizes the confounding influence of
body dimension.

Tracking Data Over Time
Tracking performance data over time can provide valuable feedback to
fitness professionals and their clients. The ability to evaluate changes in
performance in a group of peers, or with respect to an individual’s previous performances, can enable the professional to alter training as needed
or provide evidence that the given training program is working. In short,
tracking performance over time can demonstrate that clients are reaching
their goals or provide the necessary feedback for making alterations to
ensure goal achievement.
Several factors must be considered when comparing changes in performance over time. The first is a learning effect, which occurs when people
become accustomed to performing a particular test. Generally, tests should
be performed on several occasions prior to gathering the initial data set, to
familiarize clients with the test procedures. For instance, clients should be
offered the chance to try the test after being taught the appropriate technique by a qualified instructor. If the bench press 1RM test were being used
to track performance in upper body strength capacity, a qualified instructor
should provide instruction on correct technique and progression in resistance. The instructor should also provide feedback during practice attempts
to ensure that the client uses the appropriate technique. Several testing trials
should be conducted to ensure that the client is familiar with the procedures
and capable of completing them as required. Once this familiarization has
occurred, a testing session should be completed to generate data to serve
as the baseline performance for future comparisons.
Another factor that influences changes in performance over time is
maturation. This is especially significant among children and young adults
whose bodies are changing rapidly, because physiological growth factors can
alter performance. These variables should be considered when evaluating
performance, especially if comparisons are made over long periods of time
(e.g., several years).


Tests, Data Analysis, and Conclusions

Summary
■■

■■

■■

Performance tests and data evaluation can serve a variety of useful
purposes for those working in exercise and health professions.
Although the process must be conducted appropriately, and data evaluation requires a familiarization with various statistical procedures,
using quality performance tests and objectively evaluating collected
data will result in many benefits that are well worth the effort.
Fitness professionals who become adept at the testing and evaluation
process enhance their skills and become increasingly more effective.

Professional Applications

Tests, measurements, and data analysis may at times seem like unnecessary
additions to the already heavy workload of fitness professionals. Moreover,
understanding and interpreting statistics may seem outside of the scope of
practice, or scope of understanding, for professionals in this line of work. However, the ability to gather appropriate information from clients, evaluate both
group and individual data, and accurately interpret the findings is an important
and valuable aspect of high-level practices. Evidence-based practice is a term
often thrown around to gain the trust and confidence of potential clients. Professionals who use testing and data analysis to examine their own programs,
evaluate new ideas and concepts, or compare training modalities can both
profess to base their practices on scientific evidence and actually do so.
In addition to facilitating collecting data, crunching numbers, and evaluating
statistics, a keen understanding of tests and measurements can enable fitness
professionals to more accurately and confidently analyze and interpret published
research. Many professionals glance over (or skip entirely) the methods and
statistics sections of research papers because of their lack of familiarity with
research terminology and methodology. As fitness professionals become more
familiar with these procedures and this somewhat strange language, they will
become more comfortable with and capable of taking valuable information
from published research and implementing high-quality methods into their
daily practices.
