## Chapter 4: Metabolic Rate

Metabolic Rate
Wayne C. Miller, PhD, EMT

The capacity of the body to exercise or do physical work depends on its
ability to produce, use, and regulate energy. Metabolism is the term used to
describe this all-encompassing use of energy in the body. Although metabolism includes both the building up and the breaking down of biological
compounds, or the sum of the balance between food intake and energy
expenditure, we generally refer to the metabolic rate as the rate of energy
expenditure. The rate of energy expenditure (metabolism) required by
the body or any one of its cells can vary from high-power output to lowpower output. Exercise scientists classify the biochemical processes used
to expend energy during exercise into categories, depending on the power
output demand. Terms such as fast glycolysis, slow glycolysis, aerobic metabolism,
anaerobics, and others, are used to describe rates of metabolism.
Other chapters in this book describe how the capacity for energy expenditure in the various biochemical pathways affects exercise performance.
The focus of the current chapter, however, is on the body’s total metabolic
rate at rest, during exercise, and throughout the day. This chapter addresses
what constitutes the 24-hour energy expenditure, how energy expenditure
is measured, how physical activity is monitored, and how energy expenditure can be predicted.
Knowledge about energy expenditure and how it is measured can be
helpful to both the practitioner and the client. For example, knowing the
24-hour energy expenditure of a client can help the practitioner structure
a diet plan that can help the client lose weight, gain weight, or maintain
weight. This knowledge of metabolic rate would be particularly important
for the overweight client attempting weight loss or the ultra-endurance
athlete trying to maintain weight during a competitive season. Knowledge
about metabolic rate may also be helpful as a diagnostic tool to identify
possible reasons for decrements or improvements in exercise performance.

Staleness or decrements in athletic performance can often be traced to a
chronic energy imbalance, particularly in sports such as gymnastics, wrestling, and cycling.

Components of Energy Expenditure
The body’s 24-hour energy expenditure can be broken down into three
components: the thermal effect of food, the resting metabolic rate, and the
energy cost of physical activity.

Thermal Effect of Food
The thermal effect of food (TEF) is defined as the amount of energy required
to digest, absorb, and further process the energy-yielding nutrients in food
(i.e., fat, protein, carbohydrate). These energy-expending processes for
preparing food prior to its use in the body are collectively called the thermal effect of food, or alternatively, dietary-induced thermogenesis. The
contribution of the TEF to the total 24-hour energy expenditure is 5 to
10% (Miller 2006). From a practical or intervention standpoint, the TEF
is rather insignificant—individual variance in the TEF does not seem to
make a difference in body composition among people; and changes in diet
composition do not alter the TEF appreciably (Miller 2006).

Resting Metabolic Rate
The amount of energy expended to sustain the basic body functions is called
the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and is generally expressed as kilocalories
(kcal). The RMR amounts to about 1 kcal · kg–1 of body weight per hour,
or roughly 1,800 kcal per day for the average 75-kilogram (165 lb) man.
The RMR accounts for approximately 60 to 75% of the total daily energy
expenditure, and therefore, anything that alters the RMR has the potential
to significantly affect the body’s energy balance. Factors that have been
implicated in the variance found for RMR within and among people are
body composition, gender, race, restrictive dieting, and exercise. Some of
these factors are interrelated, some are subject to behavior modification,
and some are nonmodifiable (e.g., race).
Individual differences in body composition, particularly in lean body
mass, account for most of the 25 to 30% variation in RMR among people.
Muscles, organs, bone, and fluids make up most of the lean body mass. The
tissues and organs that contribute most to the RMR are the liver, skeletal
muscles, brain, heart, and kidneys. The size of each of these is directly related
to body size. The size of the skeletal muscle mass is also related to body
type, muscle development, and age. People with greater amounts of lean
body mass generally have higher RMRs than those with less lean body mass
(Cunningham 1982). Although the metabolic rate of fat mass contributes


Metabolic Rate

only 2% to the total RMR, obese people generally have a higher absolute
RMR than lean people. The proportionately larger tissue and organ size of
obese people gives them a greater total lean body mass than lean people.
Similarly, the generally larger body size and greater muscularity in men
gives them a greater total lean body mass than women. The salient point
to remember, then, is that the RMR for people of all sizes and shapes is
strongly related to their lean body mass, because lean body mass is positively
related to body size or body surface area.
Variation in RMR within a person is predominantly attributed to fluctuations in lean body mass. When an overweight or obese person loses weight,
the RMR decreases in proportion to the amount of lean body mass that is
lost, not the amount of fat lost. People who gain muscle mass (and other
lean tissue) through athletic training experience an increase in RMR in
proportion to the lean mass gained.
The fact that RMR is largely determined by lean body mass has led
many professionals (and unfortunately, some quacks) to heavily promote
unproven products, programs, supplements, and aids that are purported
to boost metabolism by increasing lean body mass. Even well-intentioned
professionals often get caught up in the notion that exercise is going to
make a huge difference in RMR by dramatically increasing lean body mass.
It is true that exercise will increase lean body mass, which will ultimately
elevate RMR, but the resultant changes in RMR are modest and will not
overshadow the effects of poor health behaviors.
For instance, the metabolic rate of 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of lean body mass
is approximately 20 kcal/d (McArdle, Katch, and Katch 2001). Therefore,
exercise would have to induce an increase in lean body mass of 5 kilograms
(11 lb) to elevate RMR by 100 kcal/d. Although an elevation in RMR of
100 kcal/d may have a significant effect on body composition over a long
period of time, a person can easily overcompensate for that 100 kcal by
consuming half of a chocolate chip cookie or 8 ounces (240 ml) of soda.
Exercise physiologists have contended for years that aerobic, or endurance, exercise training increases RMR. The research, however, suggests that
aerobic exercise training does not necessarily increase RMR significantly.
For example, Wilmore and associates (1998) showed that RMR remained
unchanged following 20 weeks of aerobic exercise training in men and
women of all ages, in spite of an 18% increase in maximal aerobic capacity. Because it is well accepted that strength training can increase muscle
mass, and that muscle mass is very active metabolically, Byrne and Wilmore
(2001) investigated how strength training may differentially affect RMR in
comparison to aerobic, or endurance, exercise training. This cross-sectional
study revealed no significant difference in RMR among strength-trained,
endurance-trained, and untrained women. Thus, it appears that neither
aerobic nor strength training increases RMR significantly.
In spite of the research, many professionals insist and continue to promote the notion that exercise training, particularly resistance training, will

67


68

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

greatly increase lean body mass and consequently RMR substantially. This
viewpoint is frequently endorsed by professionals working with overweight
clients desiring to lose weight. The weakness in this line of thinking lies
in the fact that a decrease in lean body mass almost always accompanies a
significant drop in body weight (Stiegler and Cunliff 2006). Nonetheless, the
loss in lean body mass can be minimized by including exercise in a weight
loss program (Hunter et al. 2008).
Even if a person were able to gain lean body mass through an exercise
program, how much would this affect RMR? The average amount of lean
body mass gained during several weeks of resistance training is variable.
However, the obesity research suggests that the increase in lean body mass
during exercise training with obese people amounts to only about 2 to 3
kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb). Similarly, the resting metabolic rate of muscle
tissue is variable, but several reports suggest that the value ranges from 20
to 30 kcal · kg–1 · day–1. Taking the average of these estimates, the energy
expenditure of an additional 2.5 kilograms of muscle, at 25 kcal · kg–1 · day–1,
would be 63 kcal · day–1. This would be the equivalent in energy value to
about 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) of body fat in one year. The obese person who
may need to lose 10 times this amount of fat to become normal weight
will need more motivation to resistance exercise train than the promise
that resistance exercise training will increase the lean body mass and RMR
enough to appreciably alter body fat content. On the other hand, resistance
training for the obese person will help maintain the observed decrease in
lean body mass and RMR seen with restrictive dieting.
Bray (1983) was the first to demonstrate that a reduction in energy intake
results in a decline in RMR. He found that this decrease in RMR was about
15% when subjects were removed from a maintenance diet of 3,500 kcal
· day–1 and placed on a very-low-calorie diet of 450 kcal · day–1. Although
RMR drops while a person is on a very-low-calorie diet, most scientists
agree that when energy intake is restored to predieting levels, the RMR also
returns to predieting levels, unless there is a decrease in lean body mass. In
this case, the postdiet RMR-per-lean-body-mass ratio (RMR:LBM) would be
equivalent to predieting levels. However, an early research paper revealed
that severe energy restriction lowers RMR:LBM significantly (Fricker et al.
1991). During this study, obese women were placed on a very-low-calorie
diet for three weeks. RMR:LBM declined to 94%, 91%, and 82% of the
original value on days 3, 5, and 21 of the diet, respectively.
In a randomized controlled clinical trial, moderately obese men and
women were assigned to one of three groups: diet plus strength training,
diet plus endurance training, or diet only (Geliebter et al. 1997). The exercise
protocols were designed to be isoenergetic, meaning that the energy expenditures for the two types of exercise training were equivalent. The average
weight loss among the three groups did not differ significantly after eight


Metabolic Rate

weeks, but those in the strength-trained group lost less lean body mass than
those in the other two groups did. The RMR declined significantly in each
group, with no difference among groups. These data indicate that neither
strength training nor endurance exercise training prevent the decline in
RMR caused by restrictive dieting.
These studies on the effects of restrictive dieting and RMR suggest that
the metabolic activity of the lean tissues themselves may be reduced with
restrictive dieting. The consequence of such an adaptation would be a greater
weight gain when energy consumption returns to predieting levels, greater
difficulty maintaining a reduced weight postdiet, or both. More research
needs to be done to determine whether this reduction in metabolic rate
due to severe dieting is permanent. For now, maintaining exercise training while attempting weight loss, and avoiding periods of extensive and
extreme dieting, are recommended.
African Americans have a lower RMR than Caucasians, and the magnitude of difference between the races is similar for both men and women.
Investigators have measured the RMR for African Americans to be anywhere
from 5 to 20% below that of Caucasians (Forman et al. 1998; Sharp et al.
2002). The range of difference in the RMR over a 24-hour period amounts
to 80 to 200 kcal. This metabolic discrepancy cannot be attributed to differences in age, body mass index (BMI), body composition, daily activity
levels, menstrual cycle phase, or fitness level. The mechanism underlying
this metabolic discrepancy has not yet been identified, and it is still controversial as to whether this difference in RMR between races is the cause of
the higher prevalence of obesity in African Americans. Nonetheless, research
has also shown that African Americans respond the same physiologically to
weight loss intervention as do Caucasians (Glass et al. 2002).
One promising finding is that aerobic exercise may prevent the common
age-related decline in RMR. Endurance-trained middle-aged and older
women presented a 10% higher RMR than sedentary women, when
RMR was adjusted for body composition (Van Pelt et al. 1997). Although
descriptive in nature, these data suggest that exercise may help prevent the
age-related weight gain seen in sedentary women, and that the protective
mechanism may be an altered RMR.
TEF and RMR are not subject to voluntary perturbations that would cause
changes in the 24-hour energy expenditure considerably enough to affect
body energy balance in the short term (weeks to months). Therefore, it must
be concluded that these two components of metabolism are relatively fixed,
and that we cannot voluntarily do much to change them. At best, a healthy
diet and exercise regimen can help maintain a normal RMR and possibly
prevent the slow decrease in RMR seen with aging. On the other hand, the
energy expenditure associated with physical activity, whether in the form
of structured exercise or not, is quite variable and under voluntary control.

Energy of Physical Activity
Even though skeletal muscle contributes less than 20% to the RMR, skeletal muscle can cause the most dramatic increase in metabolic rate. During
strenuous exercise, the total energy expenditure of the body may increase
to over 20 times the resting levels. This enormous elevation in the body’s
metabolic rate is the result of a 200-fold increase in the energy requirement
of exercising muscles. In terms of comparison, the RMR of a 70-kilogram
(154 lb) person is approximately 1.2 kcal per minute, whereas the energy
cost during strenuous exercise can be up to 25 kcal per minute.
A 30-minute exercise bout at moderate intensity may account for 10% or
more of daily energy expenditure. This amount of energy expended during
exercise can easily offset the energy balance of the body. A 10% or more
increase in daily energy expenditure may be desirable for an overweight
person, but may be detrimental to performance for an athlete who is not
taking in adequate energy. Furthermore, exercise may have a metabolic
effect beyond what is accounted for during the exercise session itself.
It is well established that metabolic rate remains elevated for some time
following exercise. This phenomenon has been termed excess postexercise
oxygen consumption (EPOC). Studies have shown that the magnitude of
EPOC is linearly related to the duration and intensity of exercise, and that
EPOC following a moderate-intensity exercise bout accounts for about 15%
of the total energy cost of the exercise (Gaesser and Brooks 1984). The time
for metabolism to return to baseline following an acute exercise session
can vary from as little as 20 minutes to more than 10 hours, depending on
the duration and intensity of the exercise. Increments of EPOC may play a
significant role in the energy balance of the body. Unfortunately, EPOC is
insufficiently predictable as a measurable variable in exercise prescription.
The 24-hour energy expenditure, therefore, consists of TEF, RMR, and the
energy of physical activity. TEF cannot be easily manipulated and therefore
is not considered a viable mechanism to voluntarily affect change in body
composition. RMR is strongly related to lean body mass and is depressed
during restrictive dieting, while being elevated in response to exercise
training that increases lean body mass. The changes in RMR that are seen
with either dieting or exercise training are relatively small, but they can
affect body composition over an extended period of time. The changes in
RMR due to diet and exercise can either augment or hinder weight loss
attempts by obese people. An acute exercise bout can increase metabolism
by as much as 20-fold, and can contribute as much as 20% or more to the
24-hour energy expenditure. Exercise is the only voluntary behavior that
positively affects metabolic rate.


Metabolic Rate

Sport Performance and Metabolic Rate
Knowledge of metabolic rate can help athletes as well as health-conscious
people improve their exercise performance or obtain the fat-to-lean-mass
ratio optimal for their personal situations. Metabolic knowledge can be
used to create a personal training plan, to design an eating schedule for an
ultra-endurance event, to monitor body composition during the off-season,
and to lose weight to improve health status; it can also be applied to other
needs. Two examples of how this works follow.
A personal trainer, who is also a dietitian, is working with an athlete who
wants to increase lean body mass during the off-season. The professional
obviously knows how to structure the off-season training regimen and how
to design a diet to meet specific nutritional needs. What the professional will
need to know to make this program most effective is the client’s metabolic
rate—specifically, the client’s 24-hour energy expenditure. Because this
client is an athlete who expends a great deal of energy when training, the
professional will need to determine the athlete’s exercise energy expenditure
as well as the resting energy expenditure to calculate the athlete’s 24-hour
energy expenditure. If the athlete’s RMR is 2,300 kcal per day, and the
athlete will expend an additional 700 kcal a day in exercise, the athlete’s
24-hour energy expenditure would be 3,000 kcal per day. The personal
trainer would then have to design a nutritional plan for the athlete that
surpasses 3,000 kcal per day for the athlete to increase lean body mass.
A second example is of a competitive cyclist planning to compete in an
ultra-endurance event lasting several days (e.g., the Tour de France). The
goal for the dietary prescription during the event is to ensure adequate
energy intake to meet the metabolic demands of the competition. Otherwise,
the athlete will become fatigued prematurely. Again, knowing the athlete’s
24-hour energy expenditure is critical to the design of the diet plan. If the
athlete’s RMR is 2,000 kcal per day, and the athlete expends an additional
6,000 kcal per day in activity, the goal would be to consume 8,000 kcal per
day during the event. Knowing this, the professional can now structure
the composition of the diet and the timing of dietary intake to match the
exercise needs and meet the 8,000-kcal-per-day requirement.
In the two preceding examples, accurate measures of RMR and exercise
energy expenditure were necessary prior to the design and implementation
of a diet and exercise regimen. There are several ways to measure energy
expenditure. The method of choice will depend on equipment availability,
cost, and desired accuracy.

Measurement of Energy Expenditure
Heat is released as a by-product in cellular metabolism. Because the rate
of heat release is directly proportional to the rate of metabolism, metabolic
rate can be determined by measuring heat release. The process of measuring this metabolic heat release is termed direct calorimetry.

Direct Calorimetry
Direct calorimetry can be used to measure the heat emission from a person
enclosed in an insulated chamber. The change in chamber temperature as a
result of the heat released from the body is measured in units with which
we are all familiar, kilocalories (or kcal). The machines for measuring body
heat loss are called calorimeters.
Several types of direct calorimeters have been used in studying human
metabolism: room-sized, booth- or closet-sized, and body suit calorimeters.
Room-sized direct calorimeters allow for the study of energy expenditure
in “freely living” subjects. However, the room measurements are that of a
small bedroom (3 by 3 meters, or yards), and it is debatable whether a person
is truly “freely living” in a room this confined. Closet-sized and body suit
calorimeters further confine the movement of a person and therefore can
be used only to estimate the person’s 24-hour resting energy expenditure.
Direct calorimeters are usually not available in health clubs or sport
settings because of their high cost. A body suit may cost several thousand
dollars, and a room calorimeter may cost several hundred thousand dollars.
However, professionals who work in conjunction with hospitals, clinics, or
university research labs may have access to direct calorimeters.

Indirect Calorimetry
The heat liberated from the body is the result of the metabolism of food.
The metabolism of food can be simplified into the biochemical equation:
food + O2 ➝ usable energy + heat + CO2 + H2O

This equation indicates that oxygen use and heat release are directly
related. That is, as more food is metabolized and heat release increases,
oxygen use increases as well. Most clinics and laboratories do not measure
energy expenditure (heat production) directly, because direct calorimetry
equipment is not universally available and is very expensive. Therefore,
a technique called indirect respiratory calorimetry is more commonly
employed in clinics and laboratories to measure metabolic .rate. This form
of calorimetry directly measures the oxygen consumption .(VO2) in metabolism through the measurement of respiratory gases. The VO2 data are then
converted to an equivalent energy cost in kcal.


Metabolic Rate

Metabolic rate. is derived indirectly in respiratory calorimetry by first
measuring the VO
. 2 and converting this value to a calorie value. This is
possible because VO2 can be converted to heat equivalents when the type
of nutrients undergoing metabolism is known. The energy liberated when
only fat is metabolized is 4.7 kcal · L–1 oxygen consumed, and 5.05 kcal · L–1
oxygen when only carbohydrate is metabolized. Because the energy source
for metabolism in the body is generally a combination of fat and carbohydrate, an average caloric expenditure is usually estimated. as 5 kcal · L–1 of
oxygen consumed. For example, if a person exercises at a VO2 cost of 1.0 L ·
min–1 of oxygen, the approximate energy expenditure equals 5 kcal · min–1.
Indirect respiratory calorimetry may be performed by either closed-circuit spirometry or open-circuit spirometry. With closed-circuit spirometry
systems, the person breathes 100% oxygen from a prefilled cylinder connected to a recording apparatus to account for the oxygen removed from
the cylinder and the carbon dioxide produced and collected by an absorbing material. By calculating the ratio of the volume of oxygen .consumed
to the carbon dioxide produced, a more exact calorie value for VO2 can be
determined, rather than using the average value of 5 kcal · L–1 of oxygen.
The ratio of oxygen consumed to carbon dioxide produced is called the
respiratory exchange ratio (RER). The RER will be 0.70 when the food
metabolized is 100% fat and 1.00 when the food metabolized is 100%
carbohydrate. A mixture of half fat and half carbohydrate yields an RER
of 0.85. The biochemical formula for protein metabolism is not as simple
as that for carbohydrate and fat, so indirect respiratory calorimetry methods ignore protein’s contribution to the metabolic rate. Ignoring protein’s
metabolic contribution presents some inaccuracy of measurement, but it is
well known that protein contributes almost nothing to resting metabolism
and very little to exercise metabolism (Brown, Miller, and Eason 2006).
The closed-circuit method of indirect respiratory calorimetry is most
commonly used to measure energy expenditure in clinical laboratories. Its
usefulness during exercise conditions is limited because of the resistance
to breathing offered by the closed circuit and the large volumes of oxygen
consumed during exercise.
To accommodate the exercising subject, the open-circuit technique is most
commonly used. In this method, the patient inspires air directly from the
atmosphere, and measurements of the fractional amounts of oxygen inspired
and oxygen expired are made. The respiratory volume is also measured. By
calculating the difference between the percentage of oxygen that comprises
.
both inspired and expired air, as well as the respiratory volume, the VO2
can be determined. For example, at a respiratory volume of 80 L · min–1,
an inspiratory oxygen concentration of 20.93% (0.2093), and an expiratory oxygen concentration of 18.73% (0.1873), the difference in oxygen
concentration
for the respiratory
gas is 2.2%, or 0.022. The corresponding
.
.
VO2 is 1.76 L · min–1 (VO2 = 80 L · min–1 × 0.022, or 1.76 L · min–1). At an

73


74

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

average calorie value of 5 kcal · L–1 of oxygen, the exercise energy expenditure would be 8.8 kcal · min–1 (1.76 × 5 = 8.8).
The costs of open-circuit spirometry and closed-circuit spirometry are
about the same; they range from around $15,000 to $40,000, depending
on the peripherals and added features that come with the system. The fact
that RER can be determined with indirect calorimetry makes this type of
metabolic measurement particularly useful for exercise tests and prescriptions. For example, it is well known that muscle glycogen (carbohydrate)
depletion is a major cause of fatigue during endurance events. Indirect
calorimetry can be used to determine how much fat versus how much
carbohydrate is being burned during exercise (the event). Then, after a
dietary intervention or change in training routine is implemented, indirect
calorimetry can be used to determine whether the manipulation slowed
the rate of carbohydrate use for energy, which would theoretically prolong
the onset of fatigue.

Doubly Labeled Water
Another method for measuring metabolic rate through gas exchange is
through the use of doubly labeled water. The doubly labeled water method
of indirect calorimetry works on a similar principle as indirect respiratory
calorimetry—gas exchange. However, with doubly labeled water, carbon
dioxide (CO2) production is calculated rather than oxygen consumption. An
oral dose of the stable isotopes of 2H and 18O is taken. The 2H labels the body
water pool, and the 18O labels both the body water pool and the bicarbonate
pool. The disappearance rates of the two isotopes measure the turnover of
water and the turnover of water plus CO2. The CO2 production is calculated
by the difference. Because CO2 production and oxygen consumption are
directly related (food + O2 ➝ usable energy + heat + CO2 + H2O), oxygen
consumption becomes known once CO2 is determined. Once CO2 and the
corresponding oxygen consumption are known, energy expenditure can
be calculated by the same calorimetric equations that are used for indirect
respiratory calorimetry.
The doubly labeled water technique is a clinical method for determining
energy expenditure over prolonged periods of time. The advantage of this
method is that the client can live freely for days and weeks without any
perception that a metabolic measurement is being taken. However, the
calculated result is the average energy expenditure over the entire measurement period (days to weeks). Thus, this method is not suitable for measuring
energy expenditure during a single exercise bout. Doubly labeled water is
almost exclusively used to assess metabolism in hospital and clinical settings
in which the focus is on obesity research and treatment.

Prediction of Energy Expenditure
Direct and indirect calorimetry methods for measuring energy expenditure
are too complex, time consuming, and costly for most settings. Therefore,
major efforts have been made to derive equations for predicting energy
expenditure. The most common prediction equations for RMR are those
of Kleiber (1932) and Harris and Benedict (1919). Both of these prediction
models are based on the relationship between body mass and metabolic
rate. Kleiber (1932) demonstrated that RMR, relative to body mass raised
to the exponent of 0.74, was consistent for mature mammals, ranging in
size from rats to steers (see table 4.1). Harris and Benedict (1919) included
variables other than body mass in their equation; namely, height and age
(table 4.1). These two equations are less predictive for the obese, because
obese people were not included in the original data sets.
Mifflin and coworkers (1990) included men and women of varying body
sizes and body compositions in their data set, and derived valid RMR prediction equations based on weight, height, and age. More recently, Livingston
and Kohlstadt (2005) derived RMR prediction equations from a large data
set containing both normal weight and obese people (table 4.1). These two
newer prediction equations are best suited for clients who are overweight,
whereas any of the equations presented are viable for normal weight people.
During the middle of the 20th century, much research was performed to
determine the energy cost of various physical activities. Tables and charts
were published that gave energy expenditure values (kcal) for activities
of daily living, work activities, recreational activities, and sport activities.
The accuracy of these predictors of physical activity energy expenditure is
similar to that of predicting RMR. The American College of Sports Medicine
(2010) published metabolic equations for predicting energy expenditure in

measurements taken during ergometer work while subjects were walking,

preferred calculations for people exercising on any one of these ergometers.

Estimation of 24-Hour and Physical Activity
Energy Expenditure
It is very costly, and in most cases impractical, to measure 24-hour energy
expenditure or to monitor physical activity energy expenditure through
either direct or indirect calorimetry. These two methods of measurement are
used only for research and clinical applications. Therefore, most professionals
use energy expenditure prediction equations, movement analysis devices,
or both, to estimate the energy cost of physical activity and the 24-hour
energy expenditure for their clients. Tools used to monitor physical activity
and estimate energy expenditure range from expensive and sophisticated
machines, which are found only in health centers, to inexpensive gadgets
and activity diaries, which can be found in almost any setting.

Activity Monitors
The most plausible tools for measuring either 24-hour energy expenditure or physical activity energy expenditure in the field are pedometers,
accelerometers, and heart rate monitors. Pedometers are more suited for
monitoring physical activity than 24-hour energy expenditure, whereas
accelerometers and heart rate monitors are well suited for both.

Pedometers
Pedometers have been around for several decades. The pedometer itself
measures the number of steps taken during the day. The summation of these
steps is converted to a distance, and energy expenditure is estimated based

on the distance traveled. Pedometer estimates for physical activity energy
expenditure correlate moderately well with indirect calorimetry measures
(Brown, Miller, and Eason 2006). However, only the total distance traveled
is recorded on the pedometer, and there is no indication of the intensity of
the physical activity. Therefore, pedometers are useful for gaining insight
into 24-hour energy expenditure, but do not offer any reference to exercise
intensity or activity patterns throughout the day. An advantage of pedometers is that they are relatively inexpensive; even children can learn how
to use them.

Accelerometers
Accelerometers work on a principle that is different from that of pedometers.
Accelerometers contain tiny force transducers that continuously measure
the intensity, frequency, and duration of movement for extended periods of
time. The forces measured by the accelerometer are summed and recorded
as counts per time frame. There is no consensus about the accelerometer
count thresholds for defining mild, moderate, and high exercise intensities.
Nonetheless, accelerometers are valid and reliable for monitoring physical
activity counts in both children and adults. Correlation coefficients between
accelerometer counts and indirect calorimetry measures range from about
0.60 to 0.85, which represent fairly high correlations (Brown, Miller, and
Eason 2006).
The advantage of accelerometers over pedometers is that accelerometers
can measure the intensity of energy expenditure throughout the day, and
this information can be downloaded to a computer. The computer then
generates the data and pinpoints the fluctuations in energy expenditure at
any time of day. The computer also uses regression equations to calculate
the actual energy expenditure from recorded activity counts.

Heart Rate Monitors
Heart rate is strongly related to respiratory rate and energy expenditure
across a wide range of values. Heart rate monitors are similar to accelerometers in that they can accumulate data from short or long bouts of activity
throughout the day. Heart rate data can also be downloaded to a computer,
and the magnitude of fluctuations in heart rate during the day can be pinpointed. Regression equations are used to convert heart rate measures to
energy expenditure.

Activity Surveys and Diaries
Activity diaries necessitate that the participant (or an adult observer in
the case of young children) make a record of every activity undertaken
throughout the day. The person describes the nature of the activity and the
time spent participating. This record includes activities that are sedentary

77


78

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

as well as those that require physical exertion. Predetermined values for
the energy expenditure of each activity noted in the diary are applied, and
the energy expenditure is summed across time and throughout the day.
Activity surveys are similar to activity diaries, but rather than record
the actual events at the time they occur (or shortly thereafter), recorders
estimate the activity of an average day or an average week or month. In
other words, people describe their usual routines over a period of many
days, rather than recording actual events over a period of a few days. Calculations for energy expenditure are performed as with activity diaries to
get the estimated energy expenditure.
The accuracy of physical activity surveys and diaries is variable; they
range from being rather poor indicators of actual physical activity to being
relatively good measures of physical activity. Activity surveys and diaries for
children tend to be less accurate than those intended for adults. Nonetheless, physical activity surveys and diaries are commonly used to determine
physical activity levels in both children and adults, because they are inexpensive, unobtrusive, and easily administered.
Many physical activity surveys have been designed for adults. Some of
these have been intended for specific populations, or constructed specifically
for independent research studies. The reliability and validity of these surveys
is variable. The most popular of these surveys were collected and published
by the American College of Sports Medicine (1997) several years ago.
One of the most popular physical activity surveys is the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (Craig et al. 2002; IPAQ 2011). The IPAQ
comes in a long and short version, and in several languages, and can be
downloaded (IPAQ 2011). Both versions ask respondents to record their
health-related physical activity for the past seven days. Both versions can
be either administered by a professional (in person), or self-administered.
The long version consists of 27 questions that focus on job-related physical
activity, transportation-related physical activity, housework, recreation and
sport activity, and sedentary or sitting time. The short version of the form
asks only seven questions about time spent in vigorous physical activity,
moderate intensity activity, walking, and sitting.
A popular physical activity diary for older children and adolescents is the
Previous Day Physical Activity Recall (PDPAR; Children’s Physical Activity
Research Group 2011). The PDPAR was designed to provide accurate data
on the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activities; these
are then used to estimate physical activity energy expenditure (Weston,
Petosa, and Pate 1997). The PDPAR is an activity diary that is segmented
into seventeen 30-minute intervals. Participants are given a list of 35
numbered activities in which youth normally engage. They record the
number of the activity in which they participated for any given 30-minute
interval of the previous day. For the selected activity, they also record the
intensity as being very light (slow breathing and little or no movement),


Metabolic Rate

light (normal breathing and movement), medium (increased breathing and
moderate movement), and hard (hard breathing and quick movement).
An estimated energy expenditure value is then calculated for each activity
within the given time frame.

Relevance of and Applications for Metabolic
Testing
Once a client’s metabolic data are available, the fitness professional can use
them to prescribe a diet intervention, an exercise intervention, or both, or
to monitor energy balance. The metabolic data from indirect calorimetry
measurements taken during a graded exercise test can also be used to set
a safe and appropriate exercise intensity.

Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) Testing
The measurement of RMR is most valuable in clinical practice, but it also
has applications to athletic performance. The clinical application for RMR
testing usually lies on two extremes of the spectrum—obesity and malnutrition or anorexia. The obvious use for RMR in obesity treatment is to
determine the client’s metabolic rate so that dietary interventions, exercise
interventions, or both, can be implemented to create an energy deficit that
will favor weight loss. The opposite is true for malnutrition or anorexia. In
this case, the RMR helps in the design of dietary practices that will create
a positive energy balance favoring weight gain.
The RMR test can also be used as a diagnostic tool. Because the average
RMR for adults is 3.5 milliliters of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body
weight per minute (American College of Sports Medicine 2010; 3.5 ml · kg–1
· min–1), an RMR measure that varies significantly from this average can
be seen as abnormal. If an abnormal RMR is discovered, further medical
testing, psychological testing, or both, can be done to determine whether
the aberrant RMR is to the result of a physical condition, such as hypothyroidism, or an eating disorder. A client with an abnormal RMR should be
referred to the appropriate health care professional for follow-up testing
and diagnosis. The predominant use for nonclinical RMR testing in athletics
is to ensure that adequate nutrition is maintained for the energy demands
of athletic competition.
The procedures for measuring RMR are fairly standardized and consistent from one facility to the next, although testing centers do not use the
same time frames for taking metabolic measurements. Whether the time
frame of metabolic measurement is several minutes or several hours, the
estimated RMR is calculated by averaging the minute-by-minute metabolic
rate measurements across the time of measurement.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Figure 4.1

RMR testing using indirect respiratory calorimetry.

RMR testing is almost exclusively performed by indirect calorimetry. The
general procedure is that the client reports to the laboratory in the morning as soon as possible after waking and after fasting for 8 to 12 hours. The
subject is not to have taken any stimulants, such as coffee, or been agitated
emotionally. The test begins with a run-in period of 30 to 60 minutes of
supine rest in a dimly lit room; no metabolic measurements are recorded.
This run-in period allows the person to adjust to the testing environment
and for metabolism to return to the resting level following any possible
stimulating effects incurred by coming to the testing facility. Following the
run-in period, metabolic rate is measured using indirect calorimetry. Respiratory gasses are collected using a respiratory gas mask or respiratory hood
that is draped over the client (see figure 4.1). Minute-by-minute measures
are summed and averaged to derive the RMR.
Theoretically, if the RMR of an obese person were measured at 1,700
kcal · day–1, and the person wanted to lose weight at a rate of 0.5 kilogram
(1 lb) per week; an energy intake of 1,200 kcal · day–1 would be prescribed
(1 lb fat = 3,500 kcal). If the client were to exercise, the rate of weight loss
would be increased by the energy cost of the exercise. Alternatively, the
dietary intake could be increased above 1,200 kcal · day–1 by the energy
cost of the exercise to keep the predicted weight loss consistent with 0.5
kilogram (1 lb) per week.

Metabolic Prediction Equations
Quite often, fitness professionals do not have access to the equipment needed
for measuring metabolic rate through indirect respiratory calorimetry. In
these cases, prediction equations are used to estimate the RMR or the energy


Metabolic Rate

cost of exercise. Once an estimate of metabolic rate is derived, the application is the same as described. An example of how this is done is given next.
The client is a 50-year-old obese woman who weighs 100 kilograms (220
lb) and is 169 centimeters (5 feet 6.5 inches) tall. The woman desires to lose
weight at a rate of 0.5 kilogram (1 lb) a week. Using the Harris and Benedict
equation (see table 4.1), her RMR is estimated at 1,700 kcal · day–1 [RMR
(kcal · day–1) = 9.56 × 100 + 185 × 1.68 – 4.68 × 50 + 665.1]. Comparatively,
her predicted RMR using the equation of Livingston and Kohlstadt (table
4.1) is estimated at 1,588 kcal · day–1 [RMR (kcal · day–1) = 248 × 1000.4356
– (5.09 × 50)]. The slight discrepancy between the values derived from the
two equations demonstrates that prediction equations are less accurate than
real metabolic measurements. Nonetheless, for this woman to lose weight
at a rate of 0.5 kilogram (1 lb) a week, she should consume only 1,088 to
1,200 kcal · day–1. Such a low energy intake may seem too restrictive for
this woman. Alternatively, she could consume between 1,338 and 1,450
kcal · day–1 and expend 250 kcal · day–1 in exercise to meet her goal.
If the woman decides to exercise, the question becomes how much exercise must she perform daily to meet her exercise energy expenditure goal?
The answer is found by using the exercise metabolic calculations provided
in table 4.2. If the woman selects walking for her physical activity, at a rate
of 3 miles per hour (80.5 m · min–1), then she should walk for 43 min ·
day–1 to meet her goal of 250 kcal · day–1 spent in exercise [(kcal · min–1) =
(0.1 × 80.5) + (1.8 × 80.5 × 0) + 3.5) × 100 kg body weight × 0.005 kcal ·
ml–1 oxygen, yields 5.77 kcal · min–1]. If the woman chooses to ride a cycle
ergometer for exercise, at a rate of 50 watts, she would need to ride for 56
min · day–1 to meet her goal of 250 kcal · day–1 spent in exercise [(kcal ·
min–1) = 10.8 × 50 × 100–1 + 3.5 × 100 kg body weight × 0.005 kcal · ml–1
oxygen, yields 4.45 kcal · min–1].

Pedometers
Pedometers estimate energy expenditure similar to the way metabolic
prediction equations do. However, the metabolic prediction equations
in pedometers are based on distance traveled rather than the speed and
grade of travel. Therefore, the pedometer output is usually expressed as
kcal per mile (or kilometer), rather than kcal per minute. The metabolic
calculations used in pedometers are based on the energy cost of walking 1
mile (or kilometer). Sophisticated pedometers allow the user to enter body
weight and stride length into the device, whereas inexpensive pedometers
use a predetermined average value for these variables. Pedometers are
more accurate estimating energy expenditure when the person is walking
on level ground with a consistent stride length, than when the person is
walking on a grade, has an intermittent stride length, or both. Therefore,
pedometers are more accurate at estimating energy expenditure during a
formal exercise bout than over a 24-hour period. Although pedometers

81


82

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

may not be that accurate at determining actual energy expenditure, they
are very useful for making relative comparisons for the same person (e.g.,
day-to-day step counts; Harris et al. 2009).

Accelerometers
Accelerometers are electronic motion sensors that quantify the volume and
intensity of movement over time. The raw acceleration signal of an accelerometer is specific to the brand name or model of the device, meaning that
counts from one brand or model accelerometer cannot be directly compared
to counts from another brand or model. Consequently, the raw acceleration signal of an accelerometer is usually translated into a variable that has
some common meaning (e.g., kcal). Because accelerometer technology is
based on biomechanical principles and metabolic rate is based on biological
measures, it is difficult to accurately translate accelerometer signals to metabolic rates. The process is further complicated when individual differences
in body mass and biomechanical efficiency are taken into consideration.
Indirect calorimetry is used to calibrate each brand or model of accelerometer for determining the metabolic rates of children, adolescents, and
adults. The manufacturers provide software programs that default to metabolic calculations for adults; however, because the metabolic cost of movement in children changes as they grow, a common metabolic parameter for
children has not been agreed on. Therefore, accelerometer users either use
the software default calculations for children and adolescents or construct
their own conversion programs using the data they find for children in the
scientific literature.
The accelerometer can be worn at the hip, wrist, or ankle. However, most
users find that measurements are the least variable when the unit is worn
on the hip (Heil 2006; Respironics 2008). Before using the accelerometer,
the user or clinician programs the device to take measurements in epoch
lengths ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. The gender, age,
height, and weight of the wearer are also programmed into the accelerometer at this time. Most accelerometers are waterproof and can record data
24 hours a day for a few weeks at a time. At the end of the trial period, the
data are downloaded to a computer and analyzed with the manufacturerprovided software. As mentioned earlier, the benefit of accelerometers is
that they can register the intensity of exercise within a given time frame.
Furthermore, accelerometers can be used to estimate 24-hour expenditure
as well as the energy expenditure of physical activity.

Heart Rate Monitors
Sophisticated heart rate monitors (figure 4.2) collect data in time epochs
similar to the way accelerometers do. Rather than accumulate accelerations,
though, heart rate monitors record heartbeats. Generally, the more heart-


Metabolic Rate

beats in a time epoch, the higher
the metabolic rate. Heart rates are
converted into metabolic measures
in the same way that they would be
correlated to energy expenditure
during a graded exercise test using
indirect respiratory calorimetry (see
chapter 5). In other words, metabolic rate is determined by knowing
the relationship between heart rate
and aerobic metabolism. Data from
sophisticated heart rate monitors
can be downloaded to computers,
as with accelerometers.
Less expensive heart rate monitors do not interface with computers and cannot be programmed.
The usefulness of these monitors,
therefore, is limited to immediate
observation or manual recording Figure 4.2 Training with a heart rate moniof heart rate at various time points. tor can be useful for making relative energy
expenditure comparisons from day to day.
Many people use low-cost heart
rate monitors to help them maintain their heart rate in a predetermined range during an exercise bout.
Observations and recordings of personal heart rates during exercise can be
used later to calculate whether the desired exercise intensity was met to
achieve the prescribed metabolic rate. On the other hand, the person can
determine ahead of time the target heart rate necessary for meeting any
desired metabolic rate during exercise, and then during the exercise bout
bring the heart rate to the predetermined level for the desired time frame.
Regardless of how heart rate monitors are used to estimate metabolic rate,
it must be remembered that they are not accurate in estimating the energy
cost of anaerobic exercise.

International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)
As mentioned earlier, the IPAQ comes in a long and short version (IPAQ
2011). Both versions ask respondents to record their health-related physical
activity for the past seven days. Both versions ask about physical activity
undertaken across four domains:
■■
■■
■■
■■

Leisure time physical activity
Domestic and yard physical activity
Work-related physical activity
Transport-related physical activity

83


84

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

The IPAQ short version asks for three specific types of activity within these
four domains: walking, moderate-intensity activity, and vigorous activity.
The IPAQ long version asks for details on activities within the four domains.
Both versions of the IPAQ can be scored as continuous measures of physical
activity. The calculations are made by multiplying the energy cost of each
activity in METs (metabolic equivalents or multiples of the RMR) by the
minutes the activity is performed. For example, an activity with an energy
cost of 3.0 METs performed for 25 minutes has a MET-minute value of 75.
Alternatively, the energy cost of the activity (MET) can be multiplied by
the quotient of the body weight (kg) divided by 60 to yield an energy cost
in kcal per minute.
The usefulness of the IPAQ is to determine the energy cost of physical
activity in various settings, and not to determine RMR or 24-hour energy
expenditure. However, by combining the values for the energy cost of
physical activity obtained from the IPAQ with a value for the RMR obtained
from one of the prediction equations detailed earlier, a person can derive
an estimate of the 24-hour energy expenditure. Guidelines for scoring and
comparing IPAQ scores among individuals and populations are provided
with the questionnaires (IPAQ 2011).

Previous Day Physical Activity Recall (PDPAR)
The PDPAR captures the habitual physical activity of older children and
adolescents. The PDPAR uses a time-based recall approach to record and
measure physical activity levels. Each day is divided into 34 time blocks
of 30 minutes going from 7:00 a.m. to midnight. Adolescents are asked to
record their specific activity (35 common activities are listed for them to
select from, each with a numeric code) and the intensity of the activity for
each block of time. The energy cost of physical activity is then determined
using the metabolic equivalent (MET) value for each activity. MET values
can be converted to kcal using standard conversion factors.

Comparing Metabolic Rate Measurement
Methods
Although accelerometers, pedometers, heart rate monitors, and questionnaires are not as accurate as direct and indirect calorimetry in determining
metabolic rate, these less expensive tools can be used to create exercise plans,
particularly those focused on health promotion and fitness. For example, if
a person wants to increase her fitness level by doing aerobic exercise four
times a week at a predetermined intensity, a heart rate monitor would be
an excellent tool to use for monitoring intensity. The fitness professional
could help the client determine the appropriate target heart rate, and then
show the client how to use the heart rate monitor safely to achieve the

intensity goal. Table 4.3 provides a summary of measurement methods for
metabolic rate.
A pedometer might be the tool of choice for a previously sedentary person
who wants to increase physical activity levels to lose weight or decrease
disease risk. In this instance, the fitness professional could use the pedometer
to get a baseline measure of steps per day for the client, and then help the
client set a goal to increase the number of steps per day in a safe progression.
Accelerometers and questionnaires might be used to give clients feedback
on how their activity levels fluctuate during the day or from day to day.
These tools provide a diary or history of the client’s activity that can be
reviewed with the client. Goals can be set to increase overall physical activity, physical activity during specific time periods, or the intensity of activity
at certain points. All of this information could be mapped out, depending
on the client’s needs and objectives.

Professional Applications

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

As shown throughout this chapter, fitness professionals can use information
about clients’ metabolic rates to help them achieve their performance or
health-related goals. Problems can arise, however, when the metabolic data
generated do not seem to coincide with what would be expected from the client’s demographics, behavior or training patterns, or predicted physiological
outcome(s). Under these situations, the professional needs to know how to
interpret metabolic data and how to determine whether metabolic data and
predictions are valid for that particular client. The two case studies that follow
demonstrate how the professional can overcome what initially seem to be
unsolvable inconsistencies.

Case Study 1: John’s Inability to Lose Weight
John is a client requesting an exercise program to help him lose weight. He
is an accountant, is 40 years old, and has not exercised since college. He is
6 feet 0 inches tall (183 cm) and weighs 220 pounds (100 kg). You calculate
John’s BMI to be 29.9, which is borderline obesity. You also perform a body
composition assessment on John and find him to be 31.0% body fat. John does
not have any health risk factors, except his weight. John selects walking as his
mode of exercise, and agrees to exercise for 30 minutes a day. You complete
your exercise prescription for John by teaching him how to safely monitor himself while walking.
Your facility does not have equipment for measuring metabolic rate, so you
decide to use prediction equations to estimate John’s 24-hour energy expenditure. You will subsequently use that predictive data to design a modest restriction in John’s energy intake that will allow him to feel satisfied when eating,
but still lose weight (because he is not really interested in dieting). You decide
to use the Mifflin equation (see table 4.1) to predict John’s 24-hour resting
metabolism, because John is overweight. The results calculate to be 1,948 kcal
per day. You next use the prediction equation in table 4.2 to calculate John’s
walking energy expenditure. At John’s selected speed of 3.0 miles per hour
(4.8 km/h), he should expend 5.98 kcal per minute or 179 kcal per exercise
bout. John’s total energy expenditure each day is predicted to be 2,127 kcal.
You and John next sit down with your coworker, who is a dietitian, to design
John’s eating plan. Because John does not want a restrictive diet, the dietitian
prescribes a healthy diet containing 1,800 kcal per day. This means that John’s
energy deficit should be 327 kcal per day, causing a predicted weight loss of
1 pound (0.45 kg) every 11 days.
You track John’s progress, and at the end of two months, John is feeling
discouraged because he has lost only 3 pounds (1.4 kg). His predicted weight
loss should be 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg). Your initial instinct is that John has lost
5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) of fat, but gained 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg) of lean mass from
the exercise. You repeat the body composition assessment and find that John
is still 31.0 % body fat. Your next speculation is that John has not kept his diet.


Metabolic Rate

However, John is an accountant and very particular about numbers. He has
not only adhered to his diet, but also actually weighed his food and calculated
the energy content of everything he ate. He provides dietary diaries that show
he averaged 1,800 kcal a day for the past 60 days. The dietitian concurs that
John’s records are correct. The only conclusion you can make is that the prediction equations for metabolic rate were not accurate for John.
Fortunately, you have access to an accelerometer. John agrees to wear an
accelerometer 24 hours a day for the next week. The results from the accelerometer reveal that John’s average 24-hour energy expenditure is 1,981 kcal.
This means that the prediction equations underestimated John’s daily energy
expenditure by 146 kcal per day (7% discrepancy). Multiplied by 60 days, this
error is equivalent to the caloric value of 2 pounds (0.9 kg) of fat. The discrepancy, or apparent inconsistency, has been resolved. You can now adjust John’s
regimen to meet his weight loss goal.

Case Study 2: Jill’s Deteriorating Gymnastics Performance
Jill is a competitive gymnast. Her coach is very adamant about the team’s
maintaining a rigid training schedule. The end of the season is approaching,
and Jill’s performance has deteriorated over the season. Moreover, Jill has been
plagued with minor injuries and constant aches and pains all season. Jill’s coach
has sent her to you, the strength and conditioning coach for the team. Your job
is to find out why Jill’s performance has deteriorated, and to fix the problem.
Your initial interview with Jill reveals that she has interpreted her coach’s
strict training schedule to mean that she is too fat and needs to lose weight.
Jill’s reaction to this perceived message was to diet throughout the season. She
has been seeing a clinical psychologist this year because of some emotional
problems she is having. She gives you permission to speak with her psychologist. The psychologist assures you that Jill does not have an eating disorder, but
that Jill does have a long history of dieting. The psychologist has been working
on Jill’s body perception, and asks if you have any objective information that
may help change Jill’s perception.
Your plan is to perform a diet analysis, measure resting metabolic rate, and
determine Jill’s percent body fat. The clinical psychologist refers Jill to a dietitian, and you perform the tests for body fat content and metabolism. Jill’s body
fat content is 15.2%, which is lean for a female athlete. Jill’s measured RMR
comes out to be 1,600 kcal per day. Using the Harris and Benedict equation
(table 4.1), you get a similar prediction. So, you assume that the RMR measure
is a valid metabolic measure for Jill’s small body size.
Jill’s diet analysis reveals that she is consuming only 1,250 kcal a day. Thus,
there is an energy deficit of 350 kcal a day between Jill’s intake and her 24-hour
RMR, and you have not yet accounted for her daily exercise energy expenditure.

(continued)

It is also enlightening to see that when you calculate Jill’s metabolic rate in
relation to her lean body mass, you find that the value is 18 kcal · kg LBM–1
· day–1. Given that the normal value is about 25 kcal · kg LBM–1 · day–1, with
a range of 20 to 30 kcal · kg LBM–1 · day–1, you conclude that Jill’s history of
dieting may have reduced her metabolic rate.
You bring all of this information to Jill’s psychologist and explain the following:
■■

■■

■■

Jill is consuming several hundred kcal below what she needs to maintain
her health.
Jill’s history of restrictive dieting may have reduced the metabolic rate
of her lean tissues.
Jill’s body fat content is low, but not dangerously low for a female athlete.
Nonetheless, Jill does not need to lose weight.

Rather than prescribe a rigid diet plan for Jill, the psychologist decides to
work with the dietitian to help Jill learn to eat intuitively. This means helping
Jill learn to eat with intention while paying attention to body cues of hunger
and satiety. The metabolic information you provided to Jill’s psychologist will
help both the psychologist and Jill to view Jill’s problematic behaviors more
objectively. You now need to report back to Jill’s coach that the problem has
been identified and that Jill is on the road to recovery; however, the recovery
will not be completed before the end of the season.

Summary

■■

■■

■■

Metabolism is the term used to describe the body’s ability to produce,
use, and regulate energy.
The overall energy expenditure of the body is a summation of TEF,
RMR, and the energy cost of physical activity. RMR contributes from
60 to 75% of the 24-hour energy expenditure. RMR is almost exclusively a reflection of the lean body mass (Cunningham 1982). Severe
restrictions in energy intake reduce RMR significantly, and can even
reduce the RMR:LBM ratio. Increases in lean body mass raise the
RMR slightly, but most people do not gain enough lean body mass
through exercise training to appreciably affect the RMR or overall
energy balance in the body.
The energy cost of physical activity or exercise energy expenditure
is the only component of the 24-hour energy expenditure that can
be voluntarily controlled.
Energy expenditure, or metabolic rate, can be measured through
direct calorimetry and indirect respiratory calorimetry; or estimated
by using activity monitors, prediction equations, and surveys. Once a

client’s metabolic rate is known, the fitness professional can use the
information to prescribe diet interventions, exercise interventions,
or both, or monitor the energy balance of the client.
Knowledge about exercise energy expenditure can be used to prescribe the proper intensity and duration of exercise to meet the preventive, therapeutic, or performance goals of the client.
