Balance and Stability
Sean P. Flanagan, PhD, ATC, CSCS

When thinking about balance, many images can come to mind: a surfer, a
gymnast, and a figure skater are a few of the more dramatic examples of
athletes requiring balance. However, almost every athlete, and certainly
any athlete that spends time on one foot, needs balance.
Many people equate balance and stability, but this is erroneous. Stability
is the ability to return to a desired position or motion after a disturbance.
Anytime athletes come in contact with opponents, objects, or even unexpected variations in terrain, they are exposed to disturbances. Thus, stability
is an important concept in athletics.
The examination of any motor quality or attribute requires that we first
define it in an unambiguous way and then construct a test that eliminates
all other variables except the one being tested. Measuring a fundamental
.
quality such as strength or VO2max is (relatively) straightforward. In contrast,
several fundamentally different motor qualities may have been examined
when someone is said to have good balance or be stable. By their very
nature, these qualities involve multiple joints and multiple systems (skeletal, muscular, and nervous), which makes testing a difficult proposition.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a theoretical background on the
concepts of balance and stability, discuss their effects on performance and
injury, categorize various types of tests, and describe three field tests in detail.
Training is all about improving abilities that enhance performance (such
as mobility, strength, power, endurance, or neuromuscular control). To do
so, we must first identify them through a comprehensive test battery. Other
chapters deal with fundamental qualities such as mobility and strength.
Performance is not simply the sum of all of these qualities; it is also a function of how they interact to create planned or reactive movements. Balance and stability testing is one way of assessing these interactions during
reactive events.

Body Mechanics
Many people have misconceptions about balance and stability. Added to
this confusion is the fact that some terms that have very different mechanical meanings are used interchangeably in popular jargon. What follows is
a review of some principles of mechanics and control theory to establish a
common terminology and framework for balance and balance-like measures
that will be used throughout this chapter.

Center of Gravity
To simplify the description of any rigid body (e.g., thigh, forearm), all of its
mass is assumed to be concentrated at one imaginary point known as the
center of mass. The mass of the body is evenly distributed about this point
in all directions. In the (vertical) direction of gravity, this point is known as
the center of gravity (COG). For any rigid body, the location of the center
of mass, and thus the COG, is fixed.
In a multisegmented body such as the human body, the COG is the
weighted sum of the COG of each segment. Unlike in a rigid body, the
location of the COG in a multisegmented body moves depending on the
configuration of the segments. In an adult male standing in the anatomical
position, the COG is located anterior to the second sacral vertebra (Whiting
and Rugg 2006), but raising the right arm overhead shifts the COG up and
to the right. To complicate matters even further, the location of the COG
can even be outside of the body during certain configurations. Determining
the location of the COG in space at any moment in time is no easy task,
yet the central nervous system appears to be able to accomplish this task
in most situations without much difficulty.

Ground Reaction Force
Two bodies in contact with each other produce equal and opposite reaction forces. If you are not moving, your weight will produce a force onto
the ground, which will produce an equal and opposite force back onto you
(the ground reaction force, or GRF). These forces are distributed over the
areas of contact.

Center of Pressure and Base of Support
Another simplifying assumption in the analysis of movement is that all of
the contact forces are concentrated at a single point, known as the center of
pressure (COP). The COP is not a static point but, being a representation of
the GRF, must reside within an area outlined by all contact areas. This area
is known as the base of support (BOS). For example, if only one foot is in
contact with the ground, the BOS is the contact area of the foot. If two feet


Balance and Stability

are in contact with the ground, the BOS includes the contact areas of both
feet plus the area between them (Whiting and Rugg 2006). Spreading the
feet apart (anterior–posterior, laterally, or both) or adding another point
of contact increases the size of the BOS. If body weight and the GRF are of
equal magnitudes, and the COP is located directly below the COG, then no
net forces or moments are acting on the body. The body is standing still. It
is in static equilibrium, or balanced.
Being a biological system, the human body does not remain perfectly
motionless for very long, if at all. Rather, the location of the COG in space
is constantly deviating from a central location, and the body automatically
corrects for it by relocating the COP to bring the COG back to the central
point. Although constantly in flux, the location of the COG (and thus, the
COP) is at this central point during quiet standing when integrated over time.

Balance
Balance is the ability to maintain the COG over the BOS without taking
a step. Taking a step creates a loss of balance (Horak and Nashner 1986).
Interestingly, accelerating the COM during gait involves a projection of the
COG away from the BOS, which is why walking and running are sometimes
referred to as controlled falling.
Movement of the COG (and thus, the COP) within the BOS is termed
sway. Two measures have been used to quantify sway (see figure 12.1).
The first is the angle that intersects a line that runs vertically through the
center of the BOS and a line that runs from the COG to the center of the
BOS (Nashner 1997b). The second is the excursion of the COP from its
central location (Lafond et al. 2004), usually measured with a force plate.
Although both are essentially measuring the same thing, excursion of the
COP is more precise because of the difficulties in pinpointing the location
of the COG in a multisegmented, moving body.

Steadiness
Steadiness refers to the amount of sway that occurs while maintaining a
static posture. Several measures have been used to quantify steadiness,
including the root mean square error (RMS) of the COP, COP range, mean
COP position, mean median power frequency (MPF), sway area, mean COP
velocity, and COP path length (Lafond et al. 2004). In general, the more
people move, the farther they move; or, the faster they move their COP
while maintaining a static posture, the less steady they are (see figure 12.1).
In a slow-moving situation, if the COG moves beyond the BOS, the COP
cannot create a counter-moment, and the person must take a step (i.e., loses
balance). If the COG remains within the confines of the BOS, muscular
activity can move the COP and return the COG to the more central location. However, this requires a certain amount of strength and a sufficient

not directly under the COG, a moment will exist about the ankle, and the body will sway.

reaction time. The farthest a person can move the COG and COP while
keeping the feet stationary is the limit of sway, and is also used to quantify
balance (see figure 12.1).
In a static position, the limit of sway will always be within the confines
of the BOS (Nashner 1997b). This is not necessarily the case with a moving
body. If the center of mass is moving fast enough, momentum may require
the person to take a step even if the COG is centered over the BOS, or
momentum may return the COG to a central position even if it is outside
of the BOS (Pai et al. 2000).

Stability
The terms steadiness, the ability to maintain a particular static posture
(Mackey and Robinovitch 2005), and balance, the ability to maintain the
COG over the base of support, are often used interchangeably with the term


Balance and Stability

stability. But this is not always correct. Stability is the ability to maintain a
desired position (static stability) or movement (dynamic stability) despite
kinematic (motion), kinetic (force), or control disturbances (Reeves, Narendra, and Cholewicki 2007). Steadiness is how well one can “stand still,”
whereas stability is how well one can return to a position or movement
following a perturbation. This is a subtle but important distinction. Balance
can be used in both instances: the ability to maintain the COG over the BOS
either in the absence (steadiness) or presence (static stability) of a perturbation. Because these qualities are fundamentally different, specifying which
ability is being tested is important.
Implicit in the definition of balance is that the feet remain stationary. As
mentioned earlier, walking and running involve projecting the center of
mass away from the BOS. If the feet are moving, the center of mass is following a certain trajectory, and the ability to maintain that trajectory should
be referred to as dynamic stability. It is a bit of a misnomer to use the term
dynamic balance, because keeping the COG over the BOS may actually impair
the ability to perform the task.

Control Theory
Controlling the COG, GRF, and COP is necessary for the completion of any
task. Even the simple act of standing still involves the interaction of several
complex systems (muscular, skeletal, and nervous) with the environment.
Reeves, Narendra, and Cholewicki (2007) suggested that understanding
such interactions would be greatly improved through the application of
control theory from a systems engineering perspective, a schematic of which
is presented in figure 12.2.
To begin with, the system needs some reference, which is the desired
output. If the goal of the task is static equilibrium (i.e., standing still), then
the desired posture
is the reference. If

provides inputs (i.e., producing a desired output (position or trajectory). Feedback,

is used to compare
the output to the referto t he pla nt (i.e., ence. Further inputs to the musculoskeletal system by the

system), which produces a certain output. The output is measured against
the reference by the controller via feedback (the intrinsic properties of the
musculoskeletal system and proprioception). Proprioception, or sensory
feedback, is provided by the integration of vision, vestibular, muscle, and
tendon receptors (spindles and Golgi tendon organs); joint mechanoreceptors; and cutaneous receptors. The nervous system uses this feedback to
produce a new set of inputs for the musculoskeletal system.
If the system can maintain a reference position or trajectory, or return
to a reference position or trajectory following a perturbation, the system is
said to be stable. From this definition of stability, it should be evident that
stability is a binary quality: a system is either stable or it is not. There are
no varying degrees of stability (Reeves, Narendra, and Cholewicki 2007).
If a system is unstable, it will be rather obvious. What’s probably of more
interest is the system’s performance and robustness. Performance refers to
how quickly the system can return to the desired position or trajectory following a perturbation, while robustness refers to how large a perturbation
the system can withstand.
Figure 12.2 shows three potential sources of “failure” in the system;
places that can lead to poor performance or a lack of robustness. First, the
central nervous system (CNS) could provide faulty input to the musculoskeletal system. Second, the inputs required for the task could be outside
the capability of the musculoskeletal system to achieve the task. In other
words, the body may not have the requisite mobility, strength, power, or
endurance to be successful. Third, faulty proprioception, altered intrinsic
properties, or both, of the musculoskeletal system could provide either
incorrect or delayed information to the CNS. Pinpointing which of these
areas is responsible for failure is difficult.
Tests of mobility, strength, power, and endurance are described in detail
in other chapters of this book and should be included in any assessment.
Because deficiencies in these areas impede balance and stability, they should
be identified and corrected. Proprioception tests require specialized training
and equipment, and are limited to reposition tests and movement detection
tests. Reposition tests require the subject to return to a reference position
without the aid of vision, whereas movement detection tests determine
how quickly the subject can detect passive changes in position.
Proprioceptive deficits are known to occur with injury and can be
improved during the rehabilitation process, but there is no evidence to support the ability to improve proprioception in healthy, asymptomatic people
(Ashton-Miller et al. 2001). Under most circumstances, fitness professionals
would not be involved with, or have the need for, proprioceptive testing.
By process of elimination, any decrements in performance not attributable
to the plant (musculoskeletal system) or feedback (proprioception) would
be assumed to be the fault of the controller (central nervous system; CNS).
Balance training can improve the performance of the musculoskeletal


Balance and Stability

system, proprioception, and the CNS, albeit to different degrees. Improvements to the plant would occur only in the most deconditioned people. For
example, balance training would provide eccentric loading to the musculature, but at relatively low levels. It would lead to improvements in strength
only if it were above the threshold stimulus for overload. Proprioception
is unlikely to be a factor in healthy, asymptomatic people but could be a
factor in a person rehabilitating from an injury. Balance improvements in
athletes are therefore most likely a result of changes within the CNS.
Tests of balance are sometimes called proprioception tests. As noted in the
preceding discussion, this is incorrect: proprioception is just the feedback.
Balance tests involve feedback, input, and output; they are more correctly
referred to as tests of neuromuscular control because all three areas are
being tested and cannot be isolated with these tests.
This discussion contains another layer of complexity. Because the human
body is multisegmented, every joint affects the location of the COG. Moreover, movement of any joint affects every other joint in the chain (Zajac
and Gordon 1989). Yet certain joints appear to play a more critical role in
postural control than others do. In the sagittal plane, small perturbations in
the anterior–posterior direction are usually corrected by the ankle, whereas
larger perturbations are usually corrected by the hip (Horak and Nashner
1986). Even larger corrections may require the use of the arms (Hof 2007)
or a step (Horak and Nashner 1986). In the frontal plane, the location of the
COG is controlled by the invertors and evertors of the subtalar joint, abductors and adductors of the hip, and lateral flexors of the trunk (MacKinnon
and Winter 1993). This means that the CNS must provide outputs to, as
well as integrate feedback from, several joints simultaneously.
Just as balance tests do not measure one isolated system (input, output,
feedback), they cannot be used to measure one isolated joint. If an athlete
has poor balance, isolated testing of each joint in the chain may be necessary for determining the exact location of the deficit and providing the
appropriate corrective exercises.
With this background information in mind, it is possible to describe a
number of tests and classify them according to the qualities they measure.

Balance and Stability Tests
Balance and stability are binary qualities: people either have balance (or
stability) in a particular situation or they do not. Either they maintain their
COG over their BOS, or they do not; there is no balance index. People are
either stable or they are not; they either return to the desired position or
movement, or they do not. There is no stability index (Reeves, Narendra,
and Cholewicki 2007). Rather, when performing balance-like tests, we are
measuring either the robustness or performance of the system (person).
Robustness reflects the tolerance to change in parameters (Reeves, Narendra,

301

and Cholewicki 2007). Tests measuring the length of an excursion or the
steadiness under various conditions are thus measuring robustness. Tests
that measure how quickly and accurately the person can return to a reference following a perturbation are measuring the performance. So, what is
called a balance test could be measuring one of the following six quantities:
■■
■■
■■
■■

■■

Steadiness
Limit of sway
Performance during a static test
Robustness during a static test
Performance during a dynamic test
Robustness during a dynamic test

Unfortunately, what makes deciphering the literature so challenging is
that each measure is often referred to as balance. Because of the variety of
ways people use the terms balance and stability, it is important to understand
what the authors are implying. The following sections classify tests based
on outcome measures. Where possible, reliability measures are included.
Because no gold standard exists, validity data are lacking. The utility of the
tests lies in their ability to allow the examiner to discriminate performance
or injury potential.

Postural Steadiness Tests
In a postural steadiness test, the subject assumes a particular position and
the examiner measures the amount of sway, either subjectively (visually)
or objectively (with the aid of sophisticated equipment). Postural steadiness
tests can be performed under a variety of base of support (two feet parallel, two feet tandem, one foot), surface (firm, soft), or proprioceptive (eyes
open, closed, impaired) conditions, which would measure the robustness
of the system. Following are some common postural steadiness tests:
■■
Romberg test. This test has many variations and is commonly used in
field sobriety tests. In one version of the test, the subject is asked to close
her eyes, tilt her head back, abduct both arms to 90°, and lift one foot off
the ground (Starkey and Ryan 2002). Steadiness is subjectively evaluated
by the examiner. There are no known published data concerning the validity, reliability, or normative values of this test.
■■
Balance error scoring system (BESS). During this test, the subject has three
foot positions (double leg parallel, double leg tandem, single leg) and two
surface conditions (firm, soft). Throughout the test, the hands remain on
the hips and the eyes are closed. Each position is held for 20 seconds. Points
are added each time the subject moves out of position. As in golf, a lower
score is better. The test has high reliability (ICCs = .78 to .96) (Riemann,
Guskiewicz, and Shields 1999).


Balance and Stability

Unstable platform tests. Various types of tests have been developed in
which the subject stands on an unstable platform, such as a balance board
or wobble board; the ability to balance the platform at a central position
is quantified by either the amount of time the edges of the platform are
in contact with the ground (Behm et al. 2005) or the number of times the
edges contact the ground. The reliability of such tests has been reported to
be high (r = .80 to .89; Behm et al. 2005).
■■
Computerized tests. Steadiness can be measured using a force platform
integrated with a personal computer. These systems can range from a force
platform embedded into the floor, to a system constructed specifically to
evaluate steadiness, to a system probably best described as a computerized
balance board. The NeuroCom Balance Master System includes a fixed
platform interfaced with a computer. Various measures of steadiness can
be readily determined using such a system (Blackburn et al. 2000). An
example of the computerized balance board is the Biodex Stability System.
The amount of movement allowed by the board can be increased, making
balancing more difficult. A computer algorithm then determines the standard deviations around the horizontal (level) position (Arnold and Schmitz
1998). The reliability of these measures is low to moderate (r = .42 to .82)
(Schmitz and Arnold 1998).
■■

Reach Tests
Reach tests examine the distance a subject can extend the COG over the
BOS for the purpose of quantifying the boundaries of the limit of sway.
These tests measure the robustness of the system. Following are common
reach tests:
Functional reach test. As the name implies, a functional reach test
measures how far the subject can reach forward with an arm while maintaining a BOS in the standing position (Duncan et al. 1990). The subject
raises an arm up to a leveled yardstick, which is fixed to a wall at the height
of the acromion process. The subject makes a fist, and the location on the
yardstick of the third metacarpal is noted. The subject then leans forward
as far as possible without taking a step, and the position of the third metacarpal on the yardstick is again noted. The functional reach is the distance
between the two positions. Although the reliability of this test is excellent
(ICC = .92; Duncan et al. 1990), its utility with a young, healthy population appears limited.
■■
Star excursion balance test (SEBT). The SEBT is analogous to the functional reach test, but the reaching is done with one leg while maintaining
single-limb support with the other. Additionally, instead of reaching only
in the forward direction, the subject reaches in eight directions: anterior,
posterior, medial, lateral, anterolateral, anteromedial, posterolateral, and
posteromedial (Hertel, Miller, and Denegar 2000). This test has excellent
■■

intra- and intertester reliability (ICCs = .67 to .96 and .81 to .93, respectively), provided both examiners and subjects have had adequate practice
(Hertel, Miller, and Denegar 2000; Kinzey and Armstrong 1998). Similar
to postural stability tests, tests measuring the response to perturbations of
various magnitudes or directions measure robustness, whereas those measuring the time to return to the reference movement measure performance.
The extensive equipment and training required to conduct these tests limit
their applicability in a field setting.

Postural Stability Tests
With a postural stability test, a subject assumes a position, a perturbation
is applied, and the response to that perturbation is measured. The perturbation may be self-motivated (as in landing from a jump), be provided by
a mechanical force external to the body (Duncan et al. 1990), or involve
altered sensory feedback (Nashner 1997a). Tests measuring the response to
perturbations of various magnitudes and from various directions measure
robustness, whereas those measuring the time to return to the reference
posture measure performance.
■■
Landing tests. In landing tests, subjects either jump up and land or fall
from a predetermined height. With the modified Bass test, subjects jump
from mark to mark over a predetermined zigzag course (Johnson and
Nelson 1986). At each mark, the subject must stick the landing and hold
it for five seconds. As in the BESS, points are added for errors during the
landing (failing to stop, touching the floor with anything other than the
ball of the support foot, and failing to completely cover the mark) or failure
to maintain the five-second hold (touching the floor with anything other
than the ball of the support foot or moving the supporting foot). When
adjusting the distances between marks for subject height and performing
the test using only a single leg, the reliability is moderate (ICC = .70 to .74;
Riemann, Caggiano, and Lephart 1999) to high (ICC = .87; Eechaute, Vaes,
and Duquet 2009). Various protocols have been used to evaluate the postural stability of a person landing on a force platform. These include various
heights, distances, and directions. The overall amount of sway (as measured
by a COP excursion), the amount of time requiring the GRF to return to
body weight, or both, have been measured (Ross and Guskiewicz 2003).
■■
Mechanical perturbation tests. Mechanical perturbation tests usually
come in two forms: Either the subject is tethered and a release is conducted
(Mackey and Robinovitch 2005), or the platform moves and tilts under the
subject’s feet (Pai et al. 2000; Broglio et al. 2009). The latter are also referred
to as motor control tests (Nashner 1997a). The size of the response in relation to the perturbation and the time to return to the reference position has
been measured. The extensive equipment and training required for these
tests limit their applicability in a field setting.


Balance and Stability

Sensory perturbation tests. Sensory perturbations can be as simple as
removing visual input by having subjects close their eyes or by altering
proprioceptive feedback. One such test commonly found in the literature
is referred to as a sensory organization test. It involves tilting either the
support surface or the visual surroundings of the subject, or both (Nashner
1997a). The extensive equipment and training required for these tests limit
their applicability in a field setting.
■■

Dynamic Stability Test
With a dynamic stability test, a subject performs a particular movement,
usually walking. A mechanical perturbation is applied, and the response
to that perturbation is measured (Mackey and Robinovitch 2005; Shimada
et al. 2003). Similar to postural stability tests, tests measuring the response
to perturbations of various magnitudes or directions measure robustness,
whereas those measuring the time to return to the reference movement
measure performance. The extensive equipment and training required for
these tests limit their applicability in a field setting.

Composite Tests
Composite tests involve the examination of multiple abilities simultaneously, of which balance or stability is a major component. Single-leg hop
tests for distance, in their various forms, are examples of composite tests.
Computerized dynamic posturography is not a composite test per se, but
combines a motor control test and a sensory organization test. By examining
the information provided by each test, examiners can ascertain the contributions of the biomechanical, sensory, and motor coordination components
of balance (Nashner 1997a).
Correlations among balance and stability tests are poor; investigators
report either low or nonsignificant correlations among steadiness, static
stability, dynamic stability, and composite test scores (Blackburn et al. 2000;
Broglio et al. 2009; Hamilton et al. 2008; Mackey and Robinovitch 2005;
Shimada et al. 2003). This suggests that each test measures a different quality and that, therefore, multiple balance tests may need to be administered.

Sport Performance and Balance and Stability
Because of the multifactorial nature of balance, establishing a clear link
to either performance or injury potential is difficult (table 12.1). Low balance measures could be a result of faulty central processing, deficits of the
musculoskeletal system, improper or delayed proprioceptive feedback, or
an interaction of the three. Additionally, different tests, measurements,
and study designs can make ascertaining the link between balance and
performance confusing.

Considering the following questions can help to clarify the effects of
steadiness, balance, and stability on performance and injury potential:
■■

■■

What is the relation between balance performance or robustness, and
athletic performance or injury?
Does balance training lead to improved athletic performance and
decreased injuries?

Very few studies have examined the relation between balance performance or robustness, and athletic performance. Using a wobble board test,
Behm and colleagues (2005) found a positive correlation between skating
speed and steadiness in hockey players under the age of 19 (r2 = .42), but
not for those over the age of 19 (r2 = .08). No significant correlation occurred
between postural steadiness and pitching accuracy, but a small, positive correlation did occur between sway in unilateral stance with eyes closed and
pitching velocity (r2 = .27) (Marsh et al. 2004). Finally, single-leg steadiness


Balance and Stability

was not related to unilateral strength production during a single-leg squat
(McCurdy and Langford 2006).
A few more studies examined the effect of balance training on athletic
performance. One reported improved measures of steadiness and limits
of sway following four weeks of balance training (Yaggie and Campbell
2006). Although these changes transferred to improvements in shuttle run
ability, they did not lead to improvements in the vertical jump (Yaggie and
Campbell 2006). Similarly, 10 weeks of balance training improved performance on the T-test, as well as 10- and 40-yard sprint times, but it did not
improve vertical jump performance (Cressey et al. 2007). Moreover, these
improvements were less than what was attained with traditional strength
training (Cressey et al. 2007).
With the dearth of information concerning balance performance or
robustness, and athletic performance, it is difficult to draw any definitive
conclusions. It would seem logical to conclude that balance is task specific,
and that activities with greater balance demands require greater balance
ability. Yet neither postural steadiness (as measured by the balance error
scoring system, or BESS) nor limits of postural sway (as measured by the
star excursion balance test, or SEBT) were different between soccer players
and gymnasts (Bressel et al. 2007), calling this assumption into question.
Balance requires adequate proprioception, CNS processing, and eccentric
strength. The strength levels required to maintain balance are probably
low. Proprioceptive ability does not appear to be related to performance
(Drouin et al. 2003), and studies have not demonstrated that it can even
be improved in healthy adults (Ashton-Miller et al. 2001). The process of
elimination would seem to lead to the conclusion that if balance affects
performance in healthy adults, it would most probably do so at the level of
the CNS. But this hypothesis requires further investigation.
In contrast to performance, more research has been conducted examining
the effect of balance performance or robustness on injury, although most of
these studies have focused on the lower extremities. Do those whose balance performance is low or less robust have higher injury rates? Do those
with injuries have lower balance performance, are they less robust, or both?
What is the effect of balance training on injury rates?
Prospective studies in which balance measurements are made in the preseason and related to injuries throughout the season are the gold standard
of evidence. In a prospective study of 235 U.S. female high school basketball
players, Plisky and colleagues (2006) found that girls with a composite reach
distance less than 94.0% of their limb length on the SEBT were 6.5 times
more likely to have a lower extremity injury. Similarly, steadiness measures
predicted ankle injury in Australian-rules football players (Hrysomallis,
McLaughlin, and Goodman 2007), although these same measures did not
predict knee injury. Even labral tears in the shoulder have been associated
with poor preseason steadiness measures of the nondominant leg of pitch-

ers (Burkhart, Morgan, and Kibler 2000), but these findings are equivocal
(Evans, Hertel, and Sebastianelli 2004).
Additionally, several studies have shown that those who have had a knee
(Herrington et al. 2009) or ankle (Docherty et al. 2006; Evans, Hertel, and
Sebastianelli 2004; Hertel and Olmsted-Kramer 2007; Olmsted et al. 2002;
Ross et al. 2009; Ross and Guskiewicz 2004) injury had poorer balance
performance and robustness than healthy controls, and measures of performance may be more discriminatory than measures of robustness (Ross et al.
2009). While it is hard to determine if poor balance measures are a cause
or consequence of injury, balance performance and robustness are clearly
impaired following lower extremity injury. Additionally, these measures
are improved with rehabilitation (Lee and Lin 2008; McKeon et al. 2008).
These results are not unexpected, considering that, unlike healthy controls,
people with an injury have decreased strength, decreased proprioception,
and altered central programming.
Numerous studies have examined the effect of balance training on injury
rates. In a recent systemic review of randomized controlled trials, Aaltonen
and colleagues (2007) reported that the evidence of ability of balance training by itself to prevent injuries was equivocal. This is not surprising given
the numerous protocols and balance measures used in the investigations.
However, when balance training was just one component of an intervention program, strong evidence suggested that injuries were reduced. Taken
together, the results suggest that balance should be one component of a
comprehensive testing program.

Measuring Balance and Stability
Fitness professionals should first establish the purpose of the test, pick a
category that would fulfill that purpose, and then select a test based on the
level of precision required and the resources available. Three tests, the balance error scoring system (BESS), the star excursion balance test (SEBT),
and the modified Bass test, were selected for detailed discussion here because
they represent different categories (postural steadiness, reach, and postural
stability) and require minimal specialized equipment. Additionally, the BESS
and SEBT have excellent reliability and a large body of literature supporting them. Interested readers should consult the original literature cited in
the reference section for detailed procedures on conducting the other tests.
Table 12.1 compares balance and stability evaluations.

Equipment
A foam balance pad. The foam pad is one piece of medium-density foam
(45 cm2 × 13 cm thick, density 60 kg/m3, load deflection 80-90).
Procedure
The six positions of the balance error scoring system test are depicted in
figure 12.3. Three stances (double-leg support, single-leg support, and
tandem) are held for 20 seconds on two surfaces (firm floor and foam pad)
for six permutations (Riemann, Guskiewicz, and Shields 1999). During
the tandem stance, the dominant foot is in front of the nondominant foot.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

During the single-leg stance, the subject stands on the nondominant foot.
During the test, the eyes are closed and the hands are held on the hips
(iliac crests).
Subjects are told to keep as steady as possible, and if they lose their balance, they are to try to regain the initial position as quickly as possible.
Subjects are assessed one point for the following errors: lifting the hands off
the iliac crests; opening the eyes; stepping, stumbling, or falling; remaining
out of the test position for five seconds; moving the hip into more than
30° of hip flexion or abduction; or lifting the forefoot or heel (Riemann,
Guskiewicz, and Shields 1999). A trial is considered incomplete if the subject cannot hold the position without error for at least five seconds. The
maximal number of errors per condition is 10. An incomplete condition is
given the maximal number of points (10). The numbers of errors for all six
conditions are summed into a single score.

labeled consistently in the
literature. For example, when balancing on the left leg and reaching to the
right with the right leg, some authors call this direction medial (Gribble and
Hertel 2003; Hertel et al. 2006), whereas others call it lateral (Bressel et
al. 2007). This text adopts the convention that, when standing on the left
leg, reaching to the right of the left leg is in the medial direction, whereas

reaching to the left (and behind the stance leg) is in the lateral direction
(see figure 12.4).
The subject makes a light tap on the floor, and then returns the leg to
the center of the star. The distance from the center of the star to the tap is
measured. The trial is nullified and has to be repeated if the subject commits any of the following errors: makes a heavy touch, rests the foot on
the ground, loses balance, or cannot return to the starting position under
control (Gribble 2003). The starting direction and support leg are chosen
randomly. Three trials are performed and then averaged.
Because of the significant correlation between SEBT and leg length (.02
≤ r2 ≤ .23) in a majority of the directions, excursion values should be
normalized to leg length, measured from the ASIS to the medial malleolus
(Gribble and Hertel 2003). Additionally, Hertel and colleagues (2006) suggested that testing in eight directions is redundant, and that testing only
the posteromedial direction is sufficient for most situations. To decrease the
effect of learning, Kinzey and Armstrong (1998) suggested that subjects be
given at least six practice trials before being tested, although other authors
suggested reducing the number of practice trials to four (Robinson and
Gribble 2008).

Modified Bass Test
Equipment
Athletic or masking tape
Procedure
This multiple hop test requires that 1-inch
(2.5 cm) tape squares be laid out in a course
as shown in figure 12.5 (Riemann, Caggiano,
and Lephart 1999). The subject is required
to jump from square to square, in numbered
sequence, using only one leg. The hands
should remain on the hips. On landing, the
subject remains looking facing straight ahead,
without moving the support leg, for five seconds before jumping to the next square.
There are two types of errors: landing errors
and balance errors. A landing error occurs if
the subject’s foot does not cover the tape, if
the foot is not facing forward, if the subject
stumbles on landing, or if the subject takes the
hands off the hips. A balance error occurs if
the subject takes the hands off the hips or if
the nontesting leg touches down, touches the

opposite leg, or moves into excessive flexion, extension, or abduction. The
subjects may look at the next square before jumping to it.
The examiner should count aloud the five seconds the subject is to maintain the position before moving to the next square. At the conclusion of
the test, 10 points are given for each five-second period in which there was
a landing error and 3 points for each period in which there was a balance
error. The sum of the two is the total score. At least two practice sessions
should be given before testing for score.

Interpreting the Results
When interpreting the results of balance or stability tests, values can be
compared to normative data, the other leg (if performed on a single leg),
or the same person over time. Normative data are presented for the BESS,
SEBT, and modified Bass in tables 12.2 through 12.4, respectively. Currently,
no data exist to suggest either a cutoff score for these tests or, in the case of
the SEBT or modified Bass test, a bilateral difference that would be a cause
for concern. These are areas for future investigations. Balance scores tend to
be better in the morning than in the afternoon or evening (Gribble, Tucker,
and White 2007), suggesting that if multiple tests are to be compared over
time, the time of day needs to be standardized.

Professional Applications

Like many other abilities, balance is necessary for purposeful movement. An
inability to remain balanced can disrupt force production and limit performance.
Undoubtedly, different sports require different balance and stability profiles.
Sports that require movements on one leg (such as gymnastics and soccer)
would require better performance and robustness than sports that are predominately performed on both legs (such as basketball) (Hrysomallis 2011),
because of the smaller base of support. In contrast to balance, stability is
the ability to return to a desired position or trajectory following a disturbance.
Sports performed on unstable surfaces (such as skiing or surfing) or that involve
contact with an opponent (American football, wrestling) would have greater
performance and robustness requirements than sports performed on a firm
surface with no such contact.
There is a stronger (and arguably more important) link between various measures of balance or stability and injury than the link between balance or stability
and performance. Sporting activities require that energy be generated, absorbed,
and transferred between the segments in the kinetic chain. This requires proper
alignment of the joints (Zajac, Neptune, and Kautz 2002). It stands to reason
that if the athlete cannot maintain, or return to, the proper position, energy will

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

(continued)

be absorbed by tissues that may not be equipped to handle it. It is then easy
to see how injuries, such as lateral ankle sprains, develop. The old adage “an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is very apropos when it comes
to balance and stability.
All athletes should be screened for balance and stability. Because each test
category evaluates a unique ability, a test from each category should be used
when possible. Rather than attempting to maximize balance and stability traits
in those of average abilities, fitness professionals should direct their efforts
toward those who are considered poor performers and assign remedial work
based on their deficiencies.
The BESS is a test of postural steadiness. People with poor postural steadiness, particularly those whose sports require time supported on a single leg,
should engage in exercises that require them to support themselves on a single
limb or unstable surface, such as a balance board or Dyna Disc. These exercises
can be incorporated as part of the warm-up. Low levels of instability are probably sufficient for training; athletes need not be trained like circus performers.
The SEBT is a test of postural sway, or robustness. A more robust system
can withstand a larger perturbation. Athletes deficient in this area can tolerate
only minor perturbations. Attention should be paid not only to low performers,
but also to those with large bilateral differences in performance. Drills that
perturb athletes while they are maintaining a position on one leg can result in
improvements. Tap drills, in which athletes are pushed in various directions,
are one category. Another is to have the athlete catch a medicine ball while
standing on one leg. Increasing the weight of the ball or the distance from the
center of the body will increase the size of the perturbation and theoretically
improve robustness.
The modified Bass test is a test of postural stability. This requires the athlete
to land on one foot from various directions. Athletes who perform poorly on
these types of tests should be regressed in their plyometric training and work
on “sticking” the landing after the eccentric phase before progressing back to
rapidly transitioning from the eccentric to concentric phase. Before progressing
to the rapid reversal from the eccentric phase to the concentric phase of the
exercise, athletes should be able to stick the landing (stop in a stable position
after the eccentric phase). Poor performers on the modified Bass test will not
be able to do so, at least on one foot when landing from multiple directions.
Enforcing this requirement, and requiring athletes to perform plyometrics on
one leg and in multiple directions, should help correct this deficiency.
The essence of balance and stability training is exposing athletes to a variety
of tasks with different objectives and perturbations. Many athletes will already
possess the necessary abilities to minimize injury risk and succeed in their
sports. As with many other abilities, more is not better; if a recipe calls for two


Balance and Stability

cups of sugar, adding four cups will not make a better cake. But adding only one
cup will surely affect the cake. Athletes need a minimal amount of balance and
stability, and adequate testing and training will ensure that they do. Anything
less in an overall program is a recipe for disaster.

Summary
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Balance is the ability to maintain the body’s center of gravity over
its base of support.
Stability is the ability to return to a desired position or trajectory following a disturbance.
Balance and stability are different motor qualities, and require different types of tests.
The balance error scoring system (BESS), star excursion balance test
(SEBT), and modified Bass test measure postural steadiness, limits of
sway, and postural stability, respectively. All three should be included
as part of a comprehensive testing program.
Although more is not always better in terms of balance and stability
training, poor performers on these tests should be given programs to
improve their abilities.

Science of Strength and Conditioning Series
The Science of Strength and Conditioning series was developed with the expertise of the National Strength and
Conditioning Association (NSCA). This series of texts provides the guidelines for converting scientific research into
practical application. The series covers topics such as tests and assessments, program design, and nutrition.
NSCA’s Guide to Sport and Exercise Nutrition covers all aspects of food selection,
digestion, metabolism, and hydration relevant to sport and exercise performance.
This comprehensive resource will help you understand safe and effective ways to
improve training and performance through natural nutrition-based ergogenic aids like
supplementation and macronutrient intake manipulation. You will also learn guidelines
about proper fluid intake to enhance performance and the most important criteria for
effectively evaluating the quality of sport drinks and replacement beverages.

NSCA’s Guide to Program Design moves beyond the simple template presentation of
program design to help you grasp the why’s and how’s of organizing and sequencing
training in a sport-specific, appropriate, and safe manner. The text offers 20 tables
that are sample workouts or training plans for athletes in a variety of sports, technique
photos and instructions for select drills, plus a sample annual training plan that shows
how to assemble all the pieces previously presented. Plus, extensive references offer
starting points for continued study and professional enrichment.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments presents the latest research from respected
scientists and practitioners with expertise in exercise testing and assessment. The text
begins with an introduction to testing, data analysis, and formulating conclusions.
Then, you’ll find a by-chapter presentation of tests and assessments for body
composition, heart rate and blood pressure, metabolic rate, aerobic power, lactate
threshold, muscular strength, muscular endurance, power, speed and agility, mobility,
and balance and stability.
