Muscular Strength
Gavin L. Moir, PhD

Muscular strength has long been identified as an important component in
sport performance and health (e.g., Dorchester 1944; Murray and Karpovich
1956; Paschall 1954; Sampon 1895). For this reason, tests used to identify
both prognostic and diagnostic information regarding muscular strength
are of great value to the strength and conditioning professional. The ability
to test muscular strength has significant applications when working with
athletes. For example, tests of muscular strength have been suggested as
a way to monitor the responses to a training program (Stone, Stone, and
Sands 2007; Zatsiorsky 1995), determine the training loads to use during
resistance training programs (Baechle, Earle, and Wathen 2008; Bompa and
Haff 2009), and monitor rehabilitation following injury (Flanagan, Galvin,
and Harrison 2008; Meller et al. 2007). Muscular strength tests also help
identify talent in sports such as rugby and soccer (Pienaar, Spamer, and
Steyn 1998; Reilly, Bangsbo, and Franks 2000).
In addition to sport performance applications, tests of muscular strength
have been used in clinical settings to determine the risk for falls in older
subjects (Perry et al. 2007; Wyszomierski, Chambers, and Cham 2009) and
to highlight the functional consequences of sarcopenia (Vandervoort and
Symons 1997). Additionally, muscular strength has been positively correlated to bone mineral density in older people (Iki et al. 2006; Miller et al.
2009). Clearly, the selection of appropriate tests of muscular strength is a
pertinent issue for researchers and practitioners alike.
The purpose of this chapter is to outline appropriate methods for testing
muscular strength, particularly maximal muscular strength. The reliability
and validity of the tests will be highlighted when possible. We begin, however, by defining muscular strength, which requires a brief discussion of
the mechanical and physiological factors that have been shown to influence
the expression of muscular strength.

Definition of Muscular Strength
Muscular strength is often equated with muscular force (Siff 2000; Stone,
Stone, and Sands 2007; Zatsiorsky 1995) and can be defined as the ability
of a muscle or group of muscles to produce a force against an external resistance. From this definition, the expression of muscular strength lies along
a continuum from zero (no force generated) to maximal force production
(maximal muscular strength). A force is an agent that changes, or tends to
change, the motion of an external resistance. (Note that because muscles
produce “pulling,” or tensile forces, as a result of actomyosin cycling, many
refer to the tension developed by a muscle as opposed to the force. However,
the term force will be used in this chapter for the sake of continuity.) The
rearrangement of Newton’s second law of motion defines the relationship
between an applied force (F) and the mass (m) and acceleration (a) of the
external resistance.
F = ma

where
F = applied force, measured in newtons (N),
m = mass of the external resistance, measured in kilograms (kg), and
a = acceleration of the external resistance, measured in meters per second2
(m · s–2).
Thus, the magnitude of a force can be determined by the acceleration of
an external resistance. Forces, however, take time to change the motion
of an external resistance, and so the product of force and time, called the
impulse of the force, is often calculated in mechanics:
Impulse = Ft

where
Impulse is measured in newton-seconds (Ns),
F = applied force (N), and
t = time, measured in seconds (s).
The importance of the impulse of a force becomes apparent with the
relationship between impulse and linear momentum (which can be derived
from an equation of motion):
Ft = mvf – mvi

where
Ft = impulse of the applied force (Ns),
mvf = final linear momentum of an external resistance, measured in kilograms-meters per second (kg/m · s–1), and
mvi = initial linear momentum of an external resistance, measured in
kilograms-meters per second (kg/m · s–1).


Muscular Strength

From this relationship, the impulse of an applied force acts to change
the momentum of an external resistance. Given that linear momentum
is the product of mass and linear velocity, and that the mass of external
resistances encountered in sporting and clinical situations will remain constant throughout the time of force application, the impulse–momentum
relationship defined earlier tells us that to change the linear velocity of an
external resistance, we have to apply an impulse—a force that acts over a
certain time period.
In the majority of sporting situations and activities of daily living we are
required to change the velocity of an external resistance, which may be the
mass of our own or someone else’s body, or the mass of an object or implement. The impulse–momentum relationship tells us that we can increase
the change in motion experienced by an external resistance by increasing
the magnitude of the average force applied, increasing the time that the
force is applied, or increasing both of these variables. Therefore, the impulse
of a force is important from both a mechanical and a practical perspective.
Relating muscular strength to the ability of a muscle or group of muscles
to produce a force highlights the importance of muscular strength in sport
and clinical settings. Defining muscular strength in terms of the force
capabilities of the muscles is also informative because the mechanical and
physiological factors that influence force production in skeletal muscle
have been determined. As a result, these factors can be considered when
establishing the utility of muscular strength tests.

Factors Affecting Muscular Force Production
The factors that affect force production in skeletal muscle include contraction type, muscle architecture, muscle fiber type, contractile history, and
neural influences. This section addresses these factors as well as joint torque.
It concludes with a definition of maximal muscular strength.

Contraction Type
A muscle can develop force under either static conditions (muscle length
remains constant) or dynamic conditions (muscle length changes). When
the force is developed and muscle length remains constant, the muscle is
said to be performing an isometric contraction. Under dynamic conditions,
the muscle can contract eccentrically (i.e., force is developed as the muscle
lengthens) or concentrically (i.e., force is developed as the muscle shortens). Recently, muscle physiologists have asserted that the terms eccentric
and concentric are inappropriate and misleading (Faulkner 2003); however,
the terms are still widely used in coaching circles, and will be used here.
A special case of a dynamic muscle contraction is an isokinetic contraction. Here, force is developed with the muscle acting either eccentrically

or concentrically, but the velocity of the contraction apparently remains
constant. This type of contraction will be covered in greater depth later in
the chapter (see the section Isokinetic Strength Testing).
It should be noted that although the type of contraction performed by
a muscle may be obvious in vitro, the distinction is not always clear in vivo.
For example, previous researchers have shown that muscle behavior does
not necessarily correspond to joint movement because of the presence
of extensible tendons operating in series with the muscle (Reeves and
Narici 2003). Specifically, when a joint is accelerated into extension and
the muscles crossing the joint are assumed to be operating eccentrically,
an isometric contraction may be performed while the tendon is stretched.
Such issues may affect the external validity of a test of muscular strength.
It has been established that the force developed by a muscle while operating isometrically depends upon muscle length (Rassier, MacIntosh, and
Herzog 1999). This force–length relationship (see figure 7.1) is essentially due
to changes in the overlap of the myofilaments (shallow ascending limb,
plateau, and descending limb) and the thick filaments abutting the Z-disks
(steep ascending limb). The practical significance of this relationship is that
the expression of muscular strength will vary with muscle length, which in
turn will vary with the joint angle selected during the specific test of strength.
Although the force–length relationship can be used to describe the force
developed under isometric conditions, this relationship cannot be used to
describe the behavior of muscle contracting dynamically. Rather, the force–
velocity relationship describes the force developed by a muscle when contracting eccentrically or concentrically (see figure 7.2). The precipitous drop in

force development as the shortening velocity increases can be explained
in terms of chemical reaction rates associated with actomyosin cycling as
described by the cross-bridge theory of muscle contraction (Lieber 2002).
The rise in force associated with eccentric muscle contractions cannot readily be explained by the original cross-bridge theory; some authors propose
sarcomere inhomogeneities as an explanation (Harry et al. 1990; Morgan
1990).
It should be noted that the force–velocity relationship depicted in figure
7.2 represents the relationship generated from a series of experiments performed on an isolated whole muscle in which the muscle was allowed to
contract against various loads (strictly, it is the load–velocity relationship).
In vivo measurements of the relationship using isokinetic dynamometry do
not always conform strictly to this idealized relationship; eccentric forces
are no greater than isometric forces (Dudley et al. 1990). These differences
are probably due to inhibitory reflexes that are initiated when the contractions are performed in vivo.
What is apparent from the research is that the force associated with
eccentric contractions exceeds that for concentric contractions when the
measurements are recorded in vitro as well as in vivo (Drury et al. 2006;
Harry et al. 1990). Although fitness professionals often measure concentric
capabilities in vivo, measuring eccentric forces is difficult without the use
of specialized equipment (e.g., isokinetic dynamometers, force platforms).
This is significant given the importance of eccentric forces during many

151


152

movements (LaStayo et al. 2003). Issues of eccentric force measurement
are addressed in the discussion of specific tests later in this chapter.
Researchers have demonstrated that the force developed during a concentric contraction can be enhanced when it is preceded by an eccentric
contraction (Finni, Ikegawa, and Komi 2001). This sequencing of concentric
and eccentric muscle contractions is termed the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC)
and has been shown to enhance concentric force development through
mechanisms including elastic energy contributions, reflex activation, and
architectural changes (Komi 2003). Because the SSC is a naturally occurring
sequence of muscle contractions used in sporting and daily activities, its
inclusion in a test of muscular strength will influence the validity of the test.

Muscle Architecture
The architectural characteristics that can affect the expression of muscular
strength are the cross-sectional area of the muscle and the pennation angle.

Cross-Sectional Area
The cross-sectional area (CSA) of a muscle is related to the number of sarcomeres in parallel. Because this number affects the muscle’s ability to develop
force, greater CSA is associated with greater force production (McComas
1996). Thus, hypertrophy of a muscle is a way to increase force capabilities. Despite the importance of CSA to the force capabilities of a muscle,
the relationship is not applicable to pennate muscles where the muscle
fibers operate at an angle to the line of action of the muscle (e.g., rectus
femoris). In such situations, the physiological cross-sectional area should
be calculated (Leiber 2002), whereby the angle between the orientation
of the fascicles and the line of action of the muscular force, the pennation
angle, is considered.

Pennation Angle
The pennation angle, defined as the angle between the orientation of the
fascicles and the line of action of muscular force, can have a significant
effect on muscular force—a greater pennation angle indicates greater force
capabilities (Ichinose et al. 1998) with more fibers packed into a given
volume of muscle. Researchers have reported significant positive correlations between muscle thickness and pennation angles (Ichinose et al. 1998;
Kawakami, Abe, and Fukunaga 1993), suggesting that increases in pennation angle may contribute to muscle hypertrophy. Because the pennation
angle of a muscle can change depending on the joint angle (Kawakami et
al. 2000), the force capability of a muscle will likely be affected by the joint
angle selected in a given strength test.


Muscular Strength

Muscle Fiber Type
Skeletal muscle is composed of fibers that differ in terms of their contractile properties. The heterogeneity in the contractile properties is partly
dependent on the myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms present. The type
of MHC isoform (of which Types I, IIa, and IIx are found in human skeletal
muscle) is used to classify muscle fiber types (Baldwin and Haddad 2001).
Research with muscle fibers in vitro has revealed that MHC Type IIx fibers
have greater specific tension than MHC Type I fibers (Stienen et al. 1996).
In vivo recordings in humans tend to substantiate these findings; researchers have found positive correlations between MHC Type II percentage and
muscular strength (Aagaard and Andersen 1998). Conversely, Type I fibers
have a greater oxidative capacity and therefore have greater endurance
capabilities (Bottinelli and Reggiani 2000).

Contractile History
Prior muscular contractions can have a significant effect on the ability of
a muscle to develop force through fatigue and postactivation potentiation
mechanisms.

Fatigue
Fatigue can be defined as a reversible decline in muscle performance associated with muscle activity and is marked by a progressive reduction in
the force developed by a muscle (Allen, Lamb, and Westerblad 2008). The
reduction in force may not be as pronounced during submaximal contractions as it is during maximal contractions, during which fatigue manifests
as an inability to maintain the activity at the required intensity (Allen,
Lamb, and Westerblad 2008). Muscle fibers expressing a high proportion
of MHC Type I are better able to resist fatigue during repeated contractions
(Bottinelli and Reggiani 2000). Although the mechanisms behind fatigue
are complex and specific to the task (MacIntosh, Gardiner, and McComas
2006), it is clear that the completion of prior muscular contractions can
have a significant effect on the expression of muscular strength.
It is important to note that fatigue is not just an acute phenomenon that
occurs immediately following muscular contractions, dissipating rapidly to
restore muscle function; the depression in force following muscular contractions could last days, especially when the movements involve the SSC
(Nicol, Avela, and Komi 2006; Stewart et al. 2008). Therefore, both the
short- and long-term effects of prior muscular contractions on muscular
force should be considered when measuring muscular strength.

Postactivation Potentiation
Research has shown that performing maximal or near-maximal muscular contractions can produce short-term increases in the maximal force

153


154

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

produced by the stimulated muscles in a phenomenon known as postactivation potentiation (PAP) (Hodgson, Docherty, and Robbins 2005). The
mechanical specificity between the exercise used to induce PAP and the
performance exercise appears to confer a substantial influence on the efficacy of the PAP effect (Hodgson et al. 2005). Although the mechanisms
responsible for the PAP effect are not completely clear (Robbins 2005),
PAP represents a method to potentially increase the expression of muscular
strength in the short-term.

Neural Influences on Muscular Strength
Up to this point, consideration has only been given to the mechanical
variables associated with isolated skeletal muscle or groups of muscles and
how force production is affected. However, during muscular efforts by the
intact motor system, the central nervous system has a profound effect on
the expression of muscular strength. Increasing the number of motor units
recruited during a voluntary contraction can increase the magnitude of
muscular force, while increasing the rate at which the motor neurons discharge action potentials (rate coding) will have a similar effect (Duchateau,
Semmler, and Enoka 2006). The force at which the voluntary recruitment
of motor units is complete differs among muscles (Moritz et al. 2005; Oya,
Riek, and Creswell 2009).
An understanding of neural influences on the expression of strength
has led to the development of methods to augment muscular strength. For
example, the superimposition of an electrical stimulus during a maximal
voluntary muscular contraction has been shown to increase the magnitude
of the force developed (Paillard et al. 2005). This has led some authors to
distinguish between voluntary muscular strength and absolute (superimposed stimulation) muscular strength (Zatsiorsky 1995). Although such
superimposition methods have been used to test the strength of isolated
muscles or the activity of muscles acting across a single joint, their utility
with complex, multijoint movements such as those experienced in sport and
daily activities has been questioned on both practical and safety grounds
(Stone, Stone, and Sands 2007).
As previously stated, the expression of muscular strength in a given test
is likely to result from the interaction of the force developed by groups of
muscles. A simplified representation of a joint served by an antagonistic pair
of muscles shows that the force associated with the contraction of the agonist is influenced by the activity of the antagonist. Therefore, the net force
developed during a given movement depends on the degree of coactivation
between the antagonistic pair of muscles acting across a joint. Researchers
have shown that athletes exhibit less coactivation during muscular strength
tests than sedentary people do (Amiridis et al. 1996), which may partly
explain the greater strength values recorded for well-trained subjects.
Finally, the activation of motor units during a task has been shown to

be affected by the orientation of the body segments (Brown, Kautz,
and Dairaghi 1996; Person
1974) and the direction
of force applied during a
given movement (Ter Haar
Romney, van der Gon, and
Gielen 1982; 1984). This
implies that the expression of muscular strength
is influenced by posture.

torques acting at joints
as opposed to muscular
forces alone. (In a strictly mechanical sense, a torque involves pure rotation and so the correct mechanical terminology refers to the moment of a
force, or simply the moment, acting at a joint [Chapman 2008]. However,
the term torque will be used in this chapter.) A torque is the rotational effect
of a force acting on a body that is constrained to rotate about a fixed axis.
It is calculated as the product of a force and the perpendicular distance
between the line of action of the force and the axis of rotation:
τ = Fd

where
τ = muscular torque, measured in newton-meters (N·m),
F = muscular force (N), and
d = the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the force and
the axis of rotation, measured in meters (m).
Figure 7.3 shows the schematic representation of a muscle torque (FM ×
MM) and an opposing torque associated with a resistance held in the hand
(FR × MR).
The perpendicular distance between the line of action of the force and
the axis of rotations is known as the moment arm of the muscular force.

(Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics), 71.

From the equation of muscular torque, it is clear that alterations in muscular
force or alterations in the moment arm can affect the torque produced. It
is important to note that the moment arm associated with the muscular
force will change as the joint is accelerated through a range of motion (see
figure 7.4).
The torque measured at a joint in mechanical analyses of movements
is the net torque exerted around the axis of rotation, the main cause of
which is assumed to be the activity of the muscle groups crossing the joint.
The contributions of other structures (i.e., ligaments, joint capsule) are
considered minimal, as are the contributions from muscles that may be
active but do not cross the joint of interest (see Zajac and Gordon, 1989,
for a discussion of the complexity of determining the influence of active
musculature on joint torques during multijoint movements). In some tests
of muscular strength, joints are isolated so that the torque can be assumed
to result from the active musculature crossing the joint (see the section
Isokinetic Strength Testing). Such tests may not be valid for the assessment
of multijoint movements that typically occur in sport and daily activities.
Dynamic muscle contractions are often referred to as isotonic, meaning that the tension developed by the muscle remains constant during the
contraction (Lieber 2002). Although this may be true in isolated muscle
preparations, it is unlikely to be true for muscular contractions taking place
in vivo because of the concomitant moment arm changes. Therefore, the term
isoinertial has been suggested to describe the in vivo muscle actions when
performing dynamic contractions against loads of constant mass (Abernethy,
Wilson, and Logan 1995). This term is used in this chapter.

It is important to recognize that joint motion in vivo rarely results from
the torque produced byE4846/NSCA/421868/
a single muscle.Fig.7.5/JG/R1
Rather, a number of muscles operate simultaneously, each of which has unique mechanical characteristics
(e.g., fiber type, architecture, moment arms). Therefore, the expression of
strength in a given test will result from the interaction of mechanical properties associated with groups of activated muscles (see figure 7.5).

Muscular Strength Defined
From the knowledge of the many mechanical and physiological factors that
contribute to the force developed by a muscle, our definition of muscular
strength can now be refined to the ability of a muscle or group of muscles
to voluntarily produce a force or torque against an external resistance under
specific conditions defined by muscle action, movement velocity, and posture. Maximal muscular strength is then the ability to voluntarily produce a
maximal force or torque under specific conditions defined by muscle action,
movement velocity, and posture.

Sport Performance and Muscular Strength
The first step when developing a training program for any athlete is to perform a needs analysis to evaluate the important physical characteristics of
both the sport and the athlete (Baechle, Earle, and Wathen 2008). Physical
tests should be used to determine areas of weakness relative to the specific
demands of the sport. This will allow the development of an appropriate
training program. As the athlete progresses, the effectiveness of the training
program should be evaluated using physical tests. The expression of maximal
muscular strength has been shown to be important in many sports including
baseball, basketball, American football, rugby, soccer, and sprint running
(Baker and Newton 2006; Bartlett, Storey, and Simons 1989; Cometti et
al. 2001; Fry and Kraemer, 1991; Latin, Berg, and Baechle 1994; Meckel et
al. 1995). Clearly, tests of maximal muscular strength would help strength
and conditioning professionals develop and monitor training programs for
athletes in these sports.
Performances in many sports are limited by the time athletes have to
develop force. For example, foot contact times of 220 milliseconds or less
have been reported for the long jump and high jump (Dapena and Chung
1988; Luhtanen and Komi 1979), and contact times of 120 milliseconds
or less have been reported during sprint running (Kuitunen, Komi, and
Kyrolainen 2002). Because tests of maximal muscular strength are often
unconstrained by time, some authors have suggested that such tests are not
indicative of the mechanical capabilities of the muscle (Green 1992; Komi
1984; Tidow 1990). As a result, tests in which force production is limited
by time (rate of force development) have been recommended (these tests
are discussed in chapter 9).
Because maximal muscular strength appears to be strongly related to the
ability to develop force quickly, strong people are able to generate force rapidly even when the external load they are moving is relatively light (Moss et
al. 1997). Indeed, Schmidtbleicher (1992) postulated that maximal strength
was the foundation on which muscular power is developed. Therefore, a
mesocycle in which maximal strength is increased precedes a mesocycle
emphasizing muscular power in the development of a periodized training
program (Bompa and Haff 2009; Stone, Stone, and Sands 2007). Measures
of maximal muscular strength can also be used to determine the training
loads used during these mesocycles. This again highlights the importance of
maximal muscular strength tests for strength and conditioning professionals.

Methods of Measurement
Although many of the factors affecting the expression of muscular strength
cannot be controlled by the fitness professional interested in assessing
muscular strength, many can. Therefore, before selecting a specific test


Muscular Strength

of muscular strength, the fitness professional must consider several issues
including the specificity of the test, the warm-up protocol, and the timing
and order of muscular strength tests.

Specificity of Muscular Strength
From the preceding discussion of the mechanical and physiological factors
affecting muscular strength, it should be apparent that the expression of
muscular strength is specific to the test employed. Using tests of muscular
strength that are mechanically dissimilar to the performance of interest can
compromise the external and predictive validity of the data gathered. For
example, differences between training and testing exercises in terms of the
type of muscle contraction used (Abernethy and Jürimäe 1996; Rutherford
and Jones 1986), open- versus closed-kinetic chain movements (Augustsson
et al. 1998; Carroll et al. 1998), and bilateral versus unilateral movements
(Häkkinen et al. 1996; Häkkinen and Komi 1983) have been shown to
influence the magnitude of the gains in muscular strength accrued following a period of resistance training. Therefore, fitness professionals should
consider the movement characteristics of any strength test used; the movements should be similar to the performance of interest with respect to the
following mechanical factors (Siff 2000; Stone, Stone, and Sands 2007):
Movement Patterns
■■
Complexity of movement. This involves such factors as single versus
multijoint movements.
■■
Postural factors. The posture adopted in a given movement dictates the
activation of the muscles responsible for force production.
■■
Range of motion and regions of accentuated force production. During typical
movements, the range of motion at a joint will change as will the associated muscular forces and torques. Such information can be gathered from
a biomechanical analysis of the movement.
■■
Muscle actions. This concerns the performance of concentric, eccentric,
or isometric muscle contractions. As mentioned previously, such information is not always intuitive and may not be identifiable from observing the
joint motion associated with the movement.
Force Magnitude (Peak and Mean Force)
Force magnitude refers to joint torques as well as ground reaction forces
(GRF) during the movement. This information is garnered from biomechanical analyses.
Rate of Force Development (Peak and Mean Force)
Rate of force development refers to the rate at which a joint torque or the
GRF is developed.

Acceleration and Velocity Parameters
Usually, in sporting and everyday movements, both velocity and acceleration characteristics change throughout the movement. Velocity is defined as
the rate at which the position of a body changes per unit of time, whereas
acceleration refers to the rate at which the velocity changes per unit of time.
Given Newton’s second law of motion (a = F / m), the greatest accelerations
are observed when the net forces acting on the body are largest. However,
the greatest velocities will not coincide with the largest accelerations and,
therefore, the largest net forces (unless the person is moving in a dense
fluid such as water).
Ballistic Versus Nonballistic Movements
Ballistic movements are those in which motion results from an initial
impulse from a muscular contraction, followed by the relaxation of the
muscle. The motion of the body continues as a result of the momentum
that it possesses from the initial impulse (this is the impulse-momentum
relationship). This is in contrast to nonballistic movements, in which muscular contraction is constant throughout the movement. These categories
of movements involve different mechanisms of nervous control.
Consideration of these mechanical variables will increase the likelihood
of selecting a valid test of the muscular strength. Researchers have raised
the concern that the relationships among the dependent variables associated
with strength tests (e.g., maximal external load lifted, maximal force generated) and performance variables are rarely actually assessed (Abernethy,
Wilson, and Logan 1995; Murphy and Wilson 1997). These relationships are
discussed in relation to each test covered in this chapter where appropriate.
The type of equipment used for muscular strength tests has significant
implications. For example, some tests of muscular strength can be performed
using either machine weights, in which the movement is constrained to
follow a fixed path, or free weights, in which the movement is relatively
unconstrained. However, a test performed with machine weights will not
necessarily produce the same outcome as the same test performed with
free weights. Cotterman, Darby, and Skelly (2005) reported that the values
recorded for measures of maximal muscular strength were different during
both the squat and bench press movements when the exercises were performed in a Smith machine compared to when they were performed with
free weights. Testing muscular strength with different types of equipment
introduces significant systematic bias into the data and therefore severely
compromises the reliability of the measures as well as the external validity.

Warm-Up Considerations
A warm-up is often performed prior to exercise to optimize performance
and reduce the risk of injury (Bishop 2003, a and b; Shellock and Prentice 1985). As stated previously, the force capabilities of a muscle can be


Muscular Strength

affected by the completion of previous contractions, resulting in either a
decrease in force (fatigue) or an increase in force (PAP). Indeed, both fatigue
and PAP are proposed to exist at opposite ends of a continuum of skeletal
muscle contraction (Rassier 2000). Therefore, exercises performed as part
of an active warm-up could significantly alter the expression of muscular
strength during the test.
An increase in the temperature of the working muscles has been reported
following both passive (e.g., external heating) and active (e.g., engaging
in specific exercises) warm-up activities (Bishop 2003, a and b). However,
the effects of increased temperature on measures of maximal muscular
strength are unclear with increases in maximal isometric torque reported
by some authors (Bergh and Ekblom 1979), whereas others have reported
no change (de Ruiter et al. 1999).
Static stretches are often included in the warm-up routines of athletes.
Researchers have reported a reduction in force during maximal voluntary
contractions following an acute bout of static stretches (Behm, Button, and
Butt 2001; Kokkonen, Nelson, and Cornwell 1998), leading some to propose
that static stretches be excluded from warm-up routines prior to strength and
power performances (Young and Behm 2002). However, Rubini, Costa, and
Gomes (2007) recently noted methodological issues with many of the static
stretching studies, concluding that an interference with muscular strength
is usually observed following a stretching protocol in which many exercises are held for relatively long durations, which runs counter to common
practice. Therefore, including static stretches in a warm-up routine prior to
muscular strength testing may be permissible, as long as the total stretch
duration is not excessive (four sets of exercises for each muscle group with
10-30 seconds stretch duration is recommended) and that the exercises are
performed consistently during subsequent testing sessions.
Clearly, the warm-up performed prior to a strength test can have a significant influence on the expression of muscular strength, and so the examiner
should give the warm-up due consideration. However, the most important
factor associated with the warm-up would appear to be the consistency of
the exercises incorporated; any alteration in the exercises performed will
compromise the validity and reliability of the test. Jeffreys (2008) outlined
the following warm-up protocols:
General warm-up. Five to 10 minutes of low-intensity activity aimed
at increasing heart rate, blood flow, deep muscle temperature, and respiration rate.
■■
Specific warm-up. Eight to 12 minutes of performing dynamic stretches
incorporating movements that work through the range of motion required
in the subsequent performance. This period is followed by gradually increasing the intensity of the movement-specific dynamic exercises.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Timing and Order of Tests
Researchers have reported that the expression of strength under both isometric and isokinetic conditions is affected by the time of day the tests are
taken, with greater strength values being recorded in the early evening
(Guette, Gondin, and Martin 2005; Nicolas et al. 2005). Although the
mechanisms behind this diurnal effect are unclear, the implication is that
examiners need to consider the time of day when administering strength
tests and to ensure consistency when administering the test during future
sessions.
A test of muscular strength may be one of a number of tests performed
on a person. In this case, the fitness professional needs to consider where
to place the muscular strength test in the battery. This consideration is
important given the effect that contractile history can have on the expression of muscular strength. Harman (2008) proposed the following order
for tests in a battery based on energy system requirements and the skill or
coordination demands of the tests:
Nonfatiguing tests (anthropometric measurements)
Agility tests
Maximum power and strength tests
Sprint tests
Muscular endurance tests
Fatiguing anaerobic tests
Aerobic capacity tests
Following this order should maximize the reliability of each test.

Field Tests for Muscular Strength
Field tests do not require the use of specialized laboratory equipment, such
as force platforms or dynamometers. Field tests for muscular strength tend
to be isoinertial, meaning that subjects lift a load in a specified movement;
the magnitude of the load provides a measure of maximal muscular strength.
Although many field tests incorporate the SSC, concentric- and eccentriconly measures are also possible.
The maximal load that can be lifted during a low number of repetitions
(usually a single repetition or three repetitions) in a specific movement
with appropriate technique constitutes a field test for maximal muscular
strength. Although the maximal load lifted during the specific test is recorded
by the examiner, this value is often expressed relative to the subject’s body
mass using an allometric method (load lifted / body mass2/3), which can
account for differences in anthropometric dimensions that could influence
the expression of maximal muscular strength (Jaric, Mirkov, and Markovic


Muscular Strength

2005). Such scaling techniques can enhance the comparisons in maximal
muscular strength values among subjects.
Some authors have noted that tests employing three repetitions (3-repetition maximum, or 3RM) are safer and more reliable than those in which
the subject lifts a maximal load once (1RM) (Tan 1999). However, 1RM tests
have been used with children (Faigenbaum, Milliken, and Wescott 2003)
and elderly people (Adams et al. 2000; Rydwik et al. 2007) without any
injuries reported. Similarly, 1RM tests have been shown to have acceptable
reliability (correlation coefficients ≥.79) in a variety of movements (Braith
et al. 1993; Hoeger et al. 1990; Ploutz-Snyder and Giamis 2001; Rydwik et
al. 2007). Therefore, only 1RM tests are discussed here—specifically, the
bilateral back squat, unilateral back squat, leg press, and bench press (free
weights and machine). Only tests that have clear procedures and published
reliability data (systematic bias, test–retest correlation, and within-subject
variation, where possible) are included. It should be noted that because all
of the procedures discussed here require the examiner to make an a priori
estimation of a load equivalent to the subject’s 1RM, errors in the final
value are possible.

1RM Bilateral Back Squat
The 1RM bilateral back squat protocol has been used with recreationally
active college-aged men; the 1RM values were achieved within five attempts
on average (Moir et al. 2005; 2007). McBride and colleagues (2002) used
this protocol successfully with well-trained resistance athletes performing
the squat in a Smith-type machine. Adams and colleagues (2000) used a
similar protocol to test the 1RM strength of older women (mean age: 51
years) using a squat press machine.
Equipment
Standard squat rack (crossbars placed at appropriate height)
Olympic barbell
■■ Olympic plates

Technique (Earle and Baechle 2008)
The subject grasps the barbell with a closed, pronated grip slightly wider than
shoulder width. The barbell should be placed above the posterior deltoids
(high bar position). The feet should be slightly wider than shoulder width
and pointing slightly outward when the subject begins the descent. The
subject reaches the lowest point in the descent when the top of the thighs
are parallel to the ground (see figure 7.6), and the barbell should rise in
a continuous motion without assistance. For safety, at least two spotters
should stand on either side of the barbell and follow the bar during the
descent and the ascent.

Procedure (Baechle, Earle, and
Wathen 2008)
1. The subject warms up by performing repetitions with a load
that allows 5 to 10 repetitions.
2. One-minute rest.
3. Estimate a warm-up load that
allows the subject to complete
three to five repetitions by adding
30 to 40 pounds (14 to 18 kg), or
10 to 20%, to the load used in
step 1.
4. Two-minute rest.
5. Estimate a near-maximal load
that will allow the subject to
complete two or three repetitions by adding 30 to 40 pounds Figure 7.6 The lowest position achieved

high bar position of the barbell.
6. Two- to four-minute rest.
7. The subject performs a 1RM attempt by increasing the load used in
step 5 by 30 to 40 pounds (14 to 18 kg), or 10 to 20%.
8. Two- to four-minute rest.
9. If the subject fails the 1RM attempt, decrease the load by removing 15
to 20 pounds (7 to 9 kg), or 5 to 10%, and have the subject perform
one repetition.
10. Two- to four-minute rest.
11. Continue increasing or decreasing the load until the subject can complete one repetition with appropriate technique. The subject’s 1RM
should be achieved within five attempts.
Reliability
Test–retest correlations of between .92 and .99 have been reported for 1RM
back squat loads using the procedure outlined here with recreationally active
and resistance-trained men (McBride et al. 2002; Sanborn et al. 2000).
Validity
Moderate (r = .47) to very large (r = .85) correlations between 1RM back
squat loads and measures of athletic performance such as sprint running
and agility have been reported (Chaouachi et al. 2009; Peterson, Alvar, and
Rhea 2006; Requena et al. 2009; Young and Bilby 1993). Also, 1RM back

squat loads have been shown to discriminate among playing positions within
collegiate American football and basketball (Carbuhn et al. 2008; Latin et
al. 1994) as well as differentiating playing levels in collegiate American
football (Fry and Kraemer 1991). Similarly, 1RM back squat values have
been shown to predict playing time in collegiate basketball (Hoffman et
al. 1996). Percentile values for the 1RM back squat for American football
players of various ages and playing levels are shown in table 7.1.

1RM Unilateral Back Squat
Because many sporting and daily activities require unilateral force production by the lower body (e.g., walking, running, kicking), the discussion of
a 1RM unilateral squat test is included here.

Technique (McCurdy et al.
2004)
The subject approaches and lifts
the barbell as per the 1RM back
squat. The top of the foot of the
noninvolved leg is placed behind
the subject on a supporting surface that is placed at a distance
that maintains hip extension of
the noninvolved leg. For safety,
at least two spotters should
stand on either side of the barbell and follow the bar during
the descent and the ascent. The
subject descends until the angle
between the tibia and the femur
reaches 90o and then begins the
ascent (see figure 7.7).

leg and the barbell. A successful
lift is determined by an absence of
posterior movement of the barbell and concomitant anterior movement of the
knee, thus ensuring that the load remains primarily over the involved leg.
Procedure (McCurdy et al. 2004)
1. Familiarization sessions are performed to establish appropriate submaximal loads allowing for 5 to 10 repetitions to be completed.
2. The subject performs five minutes of jogging and self-selected stretching exercises.
3. A load is selected such that the subject can achieve 5 to 10 repetitions.
4. One-minute rest.
5. The load is increased by 10 to 20%, and the subject performs five
repetitions.
6. Three- to five-minute rest.
7. The load is increased by 20 to 30%, and the subject performs one
repetition.
8. If the subject is successful, provide a three- to five-minute rest, increase
the load by 10 to 20%, and have the subject attempt another single
repetition. If the subject is unsuccessful, provide a three- to five-minute
rest, decrease the load by 5 to 10%, and have the subject complete
one repetition.


Muscular Strength

9. Continue increasing or decreasing the load until the subject can complete one repetition with appropriate technique. The subject should
achieve 1RM within five attempts.
Reliability
Test–retest correlation coefficients of .98 and .99 have been reported for
trained college-aged men and women, respectively, using the outlined procedure (McCurdy et al. 2004). In untrained college-aged men and women,
correlation coefficients of .99 and .97, respectively, have been reported
(McCurdy et al. 2004).
Validity
There are currently no published data to validate this test.

1RM Machine Leg Press
Fitness professionals may not wish to have older subjects perform a 1RM test
using free weights for safety reasons (Hoffman 2006). The 1RM machine leg
press is often used as a measure of maximal lower body muscular strength
with older subjects (Foldvari et al. 2000; Henwood, Riek, and Taafe 2008;
Marsh et al. 2009).
Equipment
Various types of machines have been used to test 1RM leg press strength in
older subjects. For example, Foldvari and colleagues (2000) used a pneumatic resistance machine (Keiser Sports Health Equipment Inc., Fresno,
CA), and Phillips and colleagues (2004) used a plate-loaded machine (Paramount Fitness Corp., Los
Angeles, CA). The protocol outlined here is that to
be used on a plate-loaded
machine.
Technique (PhiLlips et
al. 2004)
The subject sits in the leg
press chair with both feet
on the foot-plates and an
internal angle of 90° at
the knee (see figure 7.8).
The subject should not
produce excessive lordosis of the lumbar spine
during the movement.

Procedure (Phillips et al. 2004)
1. The subject performs a five-minute general warm-up on a stationary
recumbent cycle.
2. The subject performs several lifts at low or zero resistance to reestablish
familiarity with the movement.
3. Select an initial resistance slightly above that of the familiarization
resistance (add 5 to 15 lb, or 2.25 to 6.75 kg).
4. The subject performs one lift with good technique.
5. The subject rates perceived exertion on a rating of perceived exertion
(RPE) scale of 6 to 20.
6. The subject rests for one minute if RPE is below 12, and for two minutes if RPE is above 12.
7. Add 5 to 10 pounds (2.25 to 4.50 kg) depending on the RPE, and have
the subject repeat step 4.
8. Have the subject repeat the process to momentary muscular fatigue
(i.e., the subject cannot continue) or volitional fatigue (i.e., the subject
does not wish to continue).
9. Record the maximum load lifted.
Reliability
Phillips and colleagues (2004) reported within-subject variations of 3.4 and
5.6% in older men (mean age: 75.8 years) and women (mean age: 75.2
years), respectively, following a familiarization session.


Muscular Strength

Validity
Foldvari and colleagues (2000) reported a moderate correlation (r = -.43)
between 1RM leg press load and functional status in older women (mean
age: 74.8 years). However, on the strength of this relationship, 1RM leg
press explains less than 20% of the variance in functional status in older
women. Percentile values for the 1RM leg press normalized to body mass
(1RM value / body mass) for the general population are shown in table 7.2.
Note that the 1RM values are recorded in pounds.

1RM Eccentric Machine Leg Press
Because of the importance of
eccentric muscular strength in
performance (LaStayo et al.
2003), Hollander and colleagues
(2007) developed a protocol to
test eccentric strength during
a leg press movement using a
modified leg press machine.
Equipment
A weight stack machine (Master
Trainer, Rayne, LA) was modified with levers attached to allow
spotters to lift and hold the load
prior to the subjects’ eccentric
attempts (see figure 7.9).

onds. The motion of the load
during descent is observed to ensure the appropriate cadence.
Procedure (Hollander et al. 2007)
1. The subject performs two or three sets of 5 to 10 repetitions with a
load that is 40 to 60% of the estimated maximum with three- to fiveminute rests between sets.
2. The subject performs one or two sets of five repetitions with a load
that is 80% of the estimated maximum with three- to five-minute
rests between sets.
3. The subject attempts the estimated 1RM.

4. Following a three- to five-minute rest, the load is increased or
decreased depending on whether the subject has succeeded in lifting
the estimated 1RM load.
5. The process is repeated until the subject achieves a 1RM load within
five lifts.

1RM Bench Press (Free Weights)
The 1RM bench press protocol has been used with recreationally active
college-aged men where the 1RM values were achieved within four attempts
on average (Moir et al. 2007). Adams and colleagues (2000) used a similar
protocol successfully to test maximal strength in older females (mean age:
51 years).

Muscular Strength

Technique (Earle and Baechle 2008)
The subject lies supine on the bench with the head, shoulders, and buttocks
in contact with the bench and both feet in contact with the floor (five-point
contact). The bar is grasped with a closed, pronated grip slightly wider than
shoulder width. The spotter assists the subject in removing the bar to the
beginning position, where the bar is held with the elbows extended. For
safety, a spotter should stand close to the subject’s head holding the bar
with a closed, alternated grip, and follow the bar during the descent and the
ascent without touching it. Each repetition begins from this position. The
bar is lowered to touch the chest at around the level of the nipple and is
then raised in a continuous movement until the elbows are fully extended
(see figure 7.10). During the movement, the subject should maintain the
five contact points and not bounce the bar from the chest at the lowest part
of the movement.
Procedure (Baechle, Earle, and Wathen 2008)
1. The subject warms up by performing repetitions with a load that allows
5 to 10 repetitions.
2. One-minute rest.
3. Estimate a warm-up load that allows the subject to complete three to
five repetitions by adding 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kg), or 5 to 10%,
to the load used in step 1.
4. Two-minute rest.
5. Estimate a near-maximal load that will allow the subject to complete
two or three repetitions by adding 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kg), or
5 to 10%, to the load used in step 3.
6. Two- to four-minute rest.
7. Instruct the subject to perform a 1RM attempt by increasing the load
used in step 5 by 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kg), or 5 to 10%.
8. Two- to four-minute rest.
9. If the subject fails the 1RM attempt, decrease the load by removing
5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg), or 2.5 to 5%, and have the subject
perform one repetition.
10. Two- to four-minute rest.
11. Continue increasing or decreasing the load until the subject can complete one repetition with appropriate technique. The subject’s 1RM
should be achieved within five attempts.
Reliability
There are no published reliability data for this test.

Validity
Bench press tests of maximal muscular strength were able to discriminate
among collegiate American football players of differing abilities (Fry and
Kraemer 1991), while the 1RM bench press values performed in a Smithtype machine have been shown to differentiate among performance levels
in rugby league players (Baker 2001; Baker and Newton 2006). A large
correlation (r = .64) between 1RM load during the bench press and ball
throwing velocity has been reported in handball players (Marques et al.
2007). Normative values for the 1RM bench press are shown in table 7.3.

1RM Bench Press (Machine)
Because of possible safety issues, examiners may want to test the maximal
upper body strength of older people using weight machines (Humphries et
al. 1999; Izquierdo et al. 1999; Smith et al. 2003).
Equipment
As with the 1RM leg press, various machines have been used to test 1RM
bench press strength in older people. For example, Smith and colleagues
(2003) used a plate-loaded machine (Global Gym and Fitness Equipment
Ltd, Weston, ON), and Izquierdo and colleagues (1999) used a Smith-type
machine. The protocol outlined here is for use with a plate-loaded machine.


Muscular Strength

Technique (Phillips et al. 2004)
The subject holds the bar with a pronated grip and the elbows placed directly
under the bar with the forearms vertical to create a 90o angle at the elbow
joint. This configuration determines the grip width for each subject. The
feet are placed on either side or on top of the bench, depending on subject
preference. The bar should be placed directly over the midchest area. The
subject is instructed to keep the back in contact with the bench throughout the lift and to breathe out when lifting the bar and breathe in when
lowering the bar.
Procedure (Phillips et al. 2004)
1. The subject performs a five-minute general warm-up on a stationary
recumbent cycle.
2. The subject performs several lifts at low or zero resistance to reestablish
familiarity with the movement.
3. Select an initial resistance slightly above that of the familiarization
resistance (add 5 to 15 lb, or 2.23 to 6.8 kg).
4. The subject performs one lift with good technique.
5. The subject rates perceived exertion on an RPE scale of 6 to 20.
6. The subject rests one minute if the RPE is below 12, and two minutes
if the RPE is above 12.
7. Add 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) depending on the RPE, and repeat
step 4.
8. Have the subject repeat the process to momentary muscular fatigue
(i.e., the subject cannot continue) or volitional fatigue (i.e., the subject
does not wish to continue).
9. Record the maximum load lifted.
Reliability
Phillips and colleagues (2004) reported within-subject variations of 5.4 and
5.2% in older men (mean age: 75.8 years) and women (mean age: 75.2
years), respectively, in the absence of familiarization sessions.
Validity
The 1RM bench press has been used to differentiate dynamic strength of
middle-aged (35 to 46 years) and older (60 to 74 years) men (Izquierdo et
al. 1999), as well as middle-aged (45 to 49 years) and older (60 to 64 years)
women (Humphries et al. 1999).

Predicting 1RM Values From Multiple Repetitions
Objections to maximal strength testing abound in the literature, including possible injury to untrained or older people as well as prohibitive time
demands. Although the validity of some of these objections may be questioned, equations that allow fitness professionals to estimate a subject’s 1RM
value in a specific test based on multiple repetitions to failure performed
with submaximal loads have been developed. In general, the accuracy of
these equations tends to diminish as the number of submaximal repetitions
performed increases (Kemmler et al. 2006; Mayhew et al. 2004; Reynolds,
Gordon, and Robergs 2006). It is important to note that these equations
have been developed for specific cohorts performing specific exercises.
An underlying assumption of these prediction equations is that the relationship between maximal strength and the number of repetitions performed
at a percentage of 1RM does not change with training. In college-aged
men, this assumption appears to hold true for multijoint exercises such as
the bench press and leg press, but not for many single-joint exercises such
as arm curls and leg extensions (Hoeger et al. 1990; Shimano et al. 2006).
As such, the discussion here is broadly divided into equations developed
for younger subjects (<40 years) and those developed for older subjects
(>40 years) focusing on 1RM values for bench press and squat or leg press
exercises.

Prediction Equations for Younger Subjects
Using a combined group of college-aged men and women, LeSuer and
colleagues (1997) compared various equations and found the following to
produce the most accurate prediction of a 1RM value from <10 repetitions
to failure in both the squat and bench press exercises:
1RM = 100 × l[48.8 + 53.8 × e(–0.75 × r)]

where
l = the load for a given RM range,
e = approximately 2.7181, and
r = the number of repetitions achieved.
This equation overestimated both squat and bench press loads by less
than 1%. Kravitz and colleagues (2003) developed the following regression
equation to predict 1RM back squat values based on a 10 to 16RM target
in male high school powerlifters (15 to 18 years):
1RM = 159.9 + (0.103 × r × l) + (–11.552 × r)

where
r = the number of repetitions achieved, and
l = the load for a given RM range.


Muscular Strength

This equation produced errors of approximately 5 kilograms (11 lb) in
the estimation of 1RM back squat loads. The same authors developed the
following regression equation to predict 1RM bench press values based on
a 14 to 18RM target in the same subjects:
1RM = 90.66 + (0.085 × r × l) + (–5.306 × r)

where
r = the number of repetitions achieved, and
l = the load for a given RM range.
This equation produced errors of less than 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) in the
estimation of 1RM bench press loads.

Prediction Equations for Older Subjects
Very few equations to predict 1RM values have been developed for older
subjects, particularly men. In a mixed group of older men (mean age: 73.1
years) and women (mean age: 69.1 years), Knutzen, Brilla, and Caine (1999)
reported that the following equation provided the most accurate prediction
of 1RM bench press load when using 7 to 10RM loads:
1RM = 100 × l / [52.2 + 41.9 × e(–0.55 × r)]

where
l = the load for a given RM range,
e = approximately 2.7181, and
r = the number of repetitions achieved.
A correlation of .90 was demonstrated between the predicted and actual
1RM loads, although the equation underestimated the load. Using 3-5, 6-10,
11-15, and 16-20 repetition maximum (RM) loads, Kemmler and colleagues
(2006) recently developed the following polynomial equation that could be
used to predict the 1RM loads in trained postmenopausal women (mean
age: 57.4 years) for exercises including the leg press and bench press:
1RM = l(0.988 – 0.0000584r3 + 0.00190r2 + 0.0104r)

where
l = the load for a given RM range, and
r = the number of repetitions achieved.
The 1RM loads using this prediction equation were generally underestimated for both the leg press and the bench press, although the errors were
small (≥2.5%).
In summary, the prediction equations may have some utility for fitness
professionals given the associated accuracy. However, because all of the
equations either overestimate or underestimate the actual 1RM value, values
of maximal muscular strength should be measured directly.

Laboratory Tests for Maximal Muscular Strength
Laboratory tests require the use of equipment to test maximal muscular
strength, usually a force platform (Blazevich, Gill, and Newton 2002;
Kawamori et al. 2006) or a force transducer in a custom-designed system
(Requena et al. 2009). Laboratory tests for maximal muscular strength
generally provide a more objective assessment than field tests do. The
discussion here focuses on the use of force platforms in tests for maximal
muscular strength.
The use of a force platform allows for a direct measurement of GRF
during multijoint, closed-kinetic chain movements. Usually, the vertical
component of the GRF is measured in tests of muscular strength. The peak
value is a common outcome measure, although measures of the impulse of
the force are also possible, but rarely reported. The most common types of
force platforms used in kinesiology can be divided into piezoelectric platforms (e.g., Kistler type 9281) and strain-gauge platforms (e.g., Advanced
Mechanical Technologies Inc. type BP400600). All force platforms should
have high linearity, low hysteresis, low cross-talk, and adequate system
sensitivity (see Bartlett, 2007, for details on these variables).
The accuracy of measurements of maximal GRF during tests of maximal muscular strength depends on the system’s sensitivity, which in turn
depends on the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter used. Ideally, a 12-bit
converter should be used to minimize the errors in the measurement of
maximal force. However, the type of A/D converter used is absent from
the methodologies published. Similarly, rarely are other signal-processing
procedures (e.g., filtering of the force trace prior to analysis) reported in
the methodologies. Such procedures can have a significant impact on the
accuracy of the measurements.
Laboratory tests for muscular strength using force platforms can involve
either dynamic or isometric muscular contractions. Both are discussed here.

Dynamic Measures of Maximal Muscular Strength
An advantage of using a force platform during dynamic tests of muscular
strength is that eccentric forces can be measured directly. Tests for measuring eccentric forces during the back squat and bench press movements have
been published, although only those associated with the back squat have
reliability data. The loads used during the movements to record eccentric
force vary between absolute loads (or percentages of body mass) and percentages of maximal strength (1RM).

Peak Eccentric Force During a Bilateral Back Squat
In a group of recreationally active college-aged men, Murphy and Wilson
(1997) measured peak force during the eccentric phase of a back squat in
a modified Smith machine (Plyopower Technologies, Lismore, Australia)


Muscular Strength

positioned over a piezoelectric force platform (Kistler) sampling at 1,000
Hertz. The authors used a load of 200% body mass, and the bar descent was
prevented beyond an internal knee angle of 109°. On command, subjects
were instructed to resist the accelerating mass as quickly and with as much
force as possible. The load was determined from pilot work as the greatest
load that could be controlled in an eccentric–concentric action (i.e., the
subjects were able to reverse the descent of the bar). Unfortunately, reliability statistics were not reported for peak eccentric force values. However,
it was reported that the values did not change significantly following an
eight-week resistance training program that elicited improvements in performance measures (sprint running and cycling) as well as increased 1RM
back squat loads.
Frohm, Halvorsen, and Thorstensson (2005) measured eccentric force
in a group of active men using a hydraulic motor machine that assisted the
subjects in raising the load and controlled the velocity to a near-constant
value during the eccentric phase. An absolute load of 200 kilograms (441
lb) was used. These authors reported a test–retest correlation coefficient of
.81 and a within-subject variation of 9%.

Peak Eccentric Force During a Bench Press
Two studies have tested peak eccentric force during a bench press movement, both using a modified Smith machine placed over a piezoelectric
force platform (Murphy, Wilson, and Pryor 1994; Wilson, Murphy, Giorgi
1996). Both used loads relative to the subjects’ maximal muscular strength
in the bench press. Wilson and colleagues (1996) used a load equivalent to
130% 1RM, and Murphy and colleagues (1994) used loads up to 150% of
1RM. Murphy and colleagues (1994) reported large correlations between
eccentric force and a series of upper body performance tests (r > .78). However, Wilson and colleagues (1996) reported that eccentric force production
did not change following eight weeks of resistance training. Unfortunately,
method reliability was not reported in either study.

Isometric Measures of Maximal Muscular Strength
As previously mentioned, an isometric contraction occurs when muscular
force is developed but the length of the muscle remains constant. Isometric measures of maximal muscular strength are common in the published
literature. In general, these tests have been shown to have high reliability,
although the validity of these tests for use with athletic populations has
been questioned (see Wilson, 2000, for a review).
The problems with isometric muscular strength tests are attributed mainly
to the poor relationships between isometric measures and dynamic performances arising from neural and mechanical differences. There is certainly
evidence to support this view. For example, peak isometric force (PIF) in

177


178

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

unilateral, single-joint exercise (knee extension) demonstrated only a moderate correlation (r = –.42) to sprinting performance in well-trained soccer
players (Requena et al. 2009). However, this relationship was only slightly
weaker than that between an isoinertial measure of maximal muscular
strength and sprint performance (r = –.47). Baker, Wilson, and Carlyon
(1994) reported that the changes in isometric and dynamic measures of
maximal muscular strength were relatively unrelated (r = .12 to .15) following a 12-week resistance training program using isoinertial exercises
with trained men.
Despite these studies’ demonstrating the poor relationships between isometric measures and dynamic performance, others have provided contrary
findings. For example, large (r ≥ .50) and very large (r = .87) correlations
have been reported between PIF during a multijoint movement (midthigh
clean pull) and sprint cycling performance in trained cyclists (Stone et
al. 2004) as well as vertical jump performance in trained weightlifters
(Kawamori et al. 2006). Elsewhere, Stone and colleagues (2003) reported
large to very large correlations between isometric peak force in a multijoint
movement and athletic performance (r = .67 to .75). In a clinical setting,
PIF during a leg press movement demonstrated a large correlation with
functional tests in older women (mean age: 68.8 years), although less than
40% of the variance in the functional tests was explained by PIF (Forte and
Macaluso 2008).
Taken together, isometric measures of maximal muscular strength can
explain up to almost 80% of the variance in dynamic performance. This is
not dissimilar to some of the dynamic tests of muscular strength reviewed
here. Isometric tests also have the advantage of being relatively easy to
administer in terms of time and require little skill to perform the movements.

General Procedures for Isometric Tests
With isometric testing, the joint angle significantly affects muscular force
(see the section Factors Affecting Muscular Force Production); the joint angle
used should be the one that elicits peak force (Murphy et al. 1995; Stone et
al. 2003). Typically during the isometric tests, the force recordings are taken
for at least three seconds with a minimum of one minute of rest between
contractions (Bazett-Jones, Winchester, and McBride 2005; Blazevich,
Gill, and Newton 2002; Brock Symons et al. 2004; Cheng and Rice 2005;
Heinonen et al. 1994). The force trace may then be averaged across a time
window (one second), which is likely to reduce the impact of any noise in
the signal. At least two trials are recorded, and the trial in which the greatest PIF value was achieved is used in the analysis (Ahtiainen et al. 2005;
Bazett-Jones et al. 2005; Blazevich, Gill, and Newton 2002; Brock Symons
et al. 2004; Cheng and Rice 2005; Heinonen et al. 1994; Kawamori et al.
2006). When the outcome variable is PIF, the subject should be instructed
to contract as hard as possible throughout the test to ensure that force is
maximized (Christ et al. 1993).

Peak Isometric Force During Bilateral Squats
Equipment (Blazevich, Gill, and Newton 2002)
The exercise is performed in a Smith machine, and the vertical force trace
is recorded from a piezoelectric force platform (Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland) sampling at 1,000 Hertz.
Technique (Blazevich, Gill, and Newton 2002)
The subject performs a squat with a bar, descending until the internal angle
at the knee is 90°. The hip angle is measured in this position. The subject
then approaches the bar in the Smith machine and descends from a standing position until the same knee and hip angles are achieved. The bar is
then locked at this height to prevent any movement.
Procedure (Blazevich, Gill, and Newton 2002)
1. The subject performs five minutes of moderate-intensity running followed by several warm-up repetitions with free weight squats.
2. The subject performs two warm-up repetitions of the isometric squat
in the Smith machine, one at 60% of perceived maximum and the
other at 80%.
3. The subject performs three maximal isometric efforts lasting four
seconds, separated by three-minute rests.
Newton and colleagues (2002) used a similar protocol with a group of
older men (average age: 61 years), in which they measured maximal force
using chain-mounted force transducers.
Reliability
A test–retest correlation coefficient of .97 has been reported for this protocol
using recreationally active college-aged men (Blazevich, Gill, and Newton
2002).
Validity
Large correlations (r = .77) have been reported between peak isometric force
using this protocol and 1RM back squat load performed with free weights
(Blazevich, Gill, and Newton 2002). However, this still leaves over 40% of
the variance in squat performance unexplained.

Peak Isometric Force During Midthigh Clean Pulls
Equipment (Kawamori et al.
2006)
A custom adjustable squat rack
(Sorinex Inc, Irmo, SC) that allows
the bar to be fixed at the appropriate height. Force data are collected
from a force platform (Advanced
Mechanical Technologies Inc.,
Newton, M A) sampling at 500
Hertz. The subject is strapped to the
bar using lifting wraps and athletic
tape (see figure 7.11).
Technique (Kawamori et al.
2006)
The height of the bar is determined
by the subject’s knee and hip angles.
These angles are based on those
used in the dynamic midthigh pull
during training (mean knee angle:
141°; mean hip angle: 124°). The
subject approaches the bar and
grasps it as though performing the
dynamic midthigh pull.

Procedure (Kawamori et al. 2006)
1. The subject performs a warm-up including dynamic exercises focusing
on the muscle groups to be used in testing and five power cleans at
30 to 50% of the current 1RM.
2. The subject adopts the appropriate position under the bar and performs
three practice isometric pulls.
3. Following a three-minute rest, the subject performs the first isometric
pull as hard and fast as possible.
4. Following another three-minute rest, the subject performs the second
and final isometric pull.
Reliability
A test–retest correlation of .97 has been reported with male weightlifters
(Kawamori et al. 2006).
Validity
In trained weightlifters, moderate to strong correlations (r = .55 to .82)
have been reported between isometric and dynamic measures of peak force

during midthigh pulls, particularly as the load used during dynamic movement increased (Haff et al. 1997; Kawamori et al. 2006). One may expect
such a finding given that the increase in load used during the dynamic
movements may render them more “quasi-isometric.” However, large correlations (r = .82 to .87) have been reported between peak force during the
isometric midthigh pull and vertical jump performance (Kawamori et al.
2006). Similarly, Stone and colleagues (2003) reported moderate to large
correlations (r = .67 to .75) between peak force during an isometric midthigh
pull and shot put distance in a group of collegiate throwers. Interestingly,
the relationships became stronger as the subjects progressed through an
eight-week training period focusing on increasing maximal strength and
strength-power. However, these correlation values still leave a large proportion of variance in athletic performance unexplained.

Peak Isometric Force During a Bench Press

2007)
Standard bench and power rack
placed over a commercial-grade

Technique (Falvo et al.

The subject grasps the bar as
in the bench press. The height
of the bar above the floor is
adjusted so that the upper arms
are parallel to the floor and the
internal angle of the elbow joint
is 90°. The bar should be in line
with the midsternum. The bar is
then fixed in this position (see
figure 7.12).

perceived maximal effort.
2. The subject performs a maximal isometric effort for three to five seconds with the instruction to contract as hard and as fast as possible.

3. Following a 30-second rest, the subject performs a second maximal
isometric effort.
4. The force trace is filtered (fourth-order Butterworth with a 30 Hz
cutoff), and the maximal value of peak force obtained from the two
trials is recorded.
Reliability
Using college-aged resistance-trained men, Falvo and colleagues (2007)
reported a test–retest correlation of .90 and a within-subject variation of
6.6% for PIF.
Validity
Ojanen, Rauhala, and Häkkinen (2007) found that peak isometric force
during a bench press exercise was able to differentiate among male throwing athletes (shot put, discus, hammer) of various ages, and between the
athletes and age-matched controls. PIF has been shown to be significantly
reduced following eccentric contractions performed in the bench press
movement (Falvo et al. 2007). Elsewhere, however, PIF during the bench
press explained less than 30% of the variance in dynamic upper body performance (Murphy and Wilson 1996).

Isokinetic Strength Testing
Isokinetic means constant velocity, referring specifically to the angular velocity of a joint, which is constrained to rotate at a constant velocity across a
range of the movement by a dynamometer (obviously, the velocity cannot
be constant across the entire range given that there must be acceleration
at the beginning and deceleration at the end of the movement). Isokinetic
dynamometers allow rotations about a fixed axis and maintain constant,
predetermined joint angular velocity by means of hydraulic (Akron) or electromagnetic (Biodex, Con-Trex, Cybex Norm, IsoMed 2000) mechanisms
or a combination of both (Kin-Com).
It is important to recognize that although the joint motion may be constant across a given movement range during isokinetic testing, the shortening velocity of the contracting muscle fibers is unlikely to be (Ichinose et
al. 2000). Furthermore, many of the tests involve single-joint, open-kinetic
chain movements in which concentric and eccentric actions are performed.
However, multijoint, closed-kinetic chain movements are available with
certain dynamometers (Müller et al. 2007). Modifications can be made to
isokinetic dynamometers to allow the testing of children (Deighan, De Ste
Croix, and Armstrong 2003). The present focus is on single-joint rotational
measurements performed on isokinetic dynamometers in which the outcome variable of interest is peak torque.


Muscular Strength

Validity of Isokinetic Measures of Muscular Strength
A criticism of isokinetic testing is that the angular velocities achievable on
available dynamometers do not approach those achieved during sporting
movements. For example, commercially available dynamometers are capable of achieving angular velocities of up to 555° · s–1 (Baltzopoulos, 2008).
However, angular extension velocities of greater than 1,000° · s–1 have been
reported at the knee joint during sprint running (Kivi, Maraj, and Gervais
2002), and internal shoulder rotation angular velocities in excess of 5,800° ·
s–1 have been reported during the baseball pitching motion (Chu et al. 2009).
It would appear, therefore, that the criticisms of isokinetic dynamometry
on the grounds of external validity would have some merit. However, low
movement speeds are achieved during most tests of maximal muscular
strength, and of course, no external movement occurs during isometric tests.
Nevertheless, these tests are still widely used with athletes. Moreover, it
is important to remember that the purpose of an isokinetic test is to assess
the magnitude of the torque at a given velocity rather than the maximal
angular velocities achievable in a given movement.
Using sprint running as an example, Johnson and Buckley (2001)
reported a peak hip extensor torque of 377 N·m during the foot contact
phase at a time when the joint angular velocity was around 400° · s–1 (a peak
hip extension angular velocity in excess of 800° · s–1 occurred after this peak
torque). When testing the peak isokinetic hip extension torque in trained
sprinters, Blazevich and Jenkins (2002) reported average values of 302 N·m
at a velocity of 60° · s–1 and 254 N·m at a velocity of 480° · s–1. Interestingly,
these peak torque values increased following a period of resistance training
that resulted in an improvement in sprinting speed and to the same extent
as an isoinertial measure of muscular strength (1RM back squat).
In baseball pitching, Chu and colleagues (2009) reported peak internal
shoulder rotation torques of around 65 N·m and peak internal shoulder
rotation angular velocities in excess of 5,800° · s–1. Carter and colleagues
(2007) reported peak isokinetic internal rotation torques of around 60 N ·
m at an angular velocity of 300° · s–1 measured on an isokinetic dynamometer. Again, the magnitude of the torque increased following a period of
plyometric training that resulted in an improvement in throwing velocity.
It appears that isokinetic dynamometers are unable to produce the angular
velocities recorded during sporting movements, but are able to elicit the
magnitude of the joint torques observed. As already noted, force/torque
magnitude constitutes an important element of specificity of strength tests
(albeit with other mechanical variables).
Another criticism of isokinetic tests is that very rarely in sporting and
everyday movements does a joint rotate with constant angular velocity.
Indeed, this may be a more valid objection to isokinetic testing than the
relatively low velocities associated with current dynamometers and is more
difficult to defend. Similarly, the posture adopted during isokinetic tests

183


184

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

may limit the external validity of the measures obtained. Indeed, peak
torque during a single-joint movement (knee extension) at slow (60° · s–1),
moderate (180° · s–1), and high (270° · s–1) testing velocities demonstrated
only moderate correlations (r ≤ .31) to sprinting performance in both
well-trained and recreationally active subjects (Murphy and Wilson 1997;
Requena et al. 2009). The strength of these relationships was below that
reported using both dynamic and isometric measures of maximal muscular
strength.
Abernethy and Jürimäe (1996) reported that measures of isokinetic
peak torque were not immediately sensitive to the increases in muscular
strength accrued from isoinertial resistance training methods. The strength
gains demonstrated by isokinetic measures were achieved weeks following those observed with isoinertial and even isometric tests of maximal
muscular strength.
Despite the studies that bring the validity of isokinetic measures of muscular strength into question, some studies support its validity. For example,
internal shoulder rotation peak torque at 210° · s–1 is significantly related to
peak serve velocity (r = .86) in collegiate female tennis players (Kraemer
et al. 2000), and external shoulder rotation peak torque at 240 and 400°
· s–1 demonstrated large correlations (r ≥ .76) with javelin throw distance
in trained javelin throwers (Forthomme et al. 2007). Others have reported
moderate correlations (r > .55) between various isokinetic measures and
sprint running performance (Dowson et al. 1998; Nesser et al. 1996). Similarly, peak torque during both concentric and eccentric contractions of the
knee extensors has been shown to discriminate among sprinters, rugby
players, and sedentary subjects (Dowson et al. 1998).
On a more practical level, the time needed for setting up the dynamometer for each subject and the prohibitive cost of isokinetic dynamometers,
as well as the associated space requirements, may render isokinetic dynamometry inappropriate for many fitness professionals. Baltzopoulos (2008)
and Wrigley and Strauss (2000) offer a complete discussion of these issues.

Reliability of Isokinetic Measures of Muscular Strength
In general, isokinetic measures of maximal muscular strength (peak torque)
have shown acceptable reliability. For example, Maffiuletti and colleagues
(2007) have reported test–retest correlation values for concentric peak
torque of ≥.98 and within-subject variations of ≤3.3% for velocities
between 60 and 180° · s–1 for the knee flexors and extensors in a group of
recreationally active men and women. Peak torque values about the ankle
joint tend to be less reliable (Müller et al. 2007).
Peak knee extension torques obtained during both concentric and eccentric contractions have been shown to be reliable (test–retest correlations
≥.88) in a group of older (average age: 72 years) women (Brock Symons et
al. 2004). Test–retest correlation coefficients of ≥.72 (within-subject varia-


Muscular Strength

tion ≤15%) have been reported for the peak extensor torques at the elbow
and knee joints at low (30° · s–1) and moderate (180° · s–1) velocities in young
(average age: 10.1 years) boys using a modified dynamometer (Deighan,
De Ste Croix, and Armstrong 2003). The peak flexor torques were slightly
less reliable (test–retest correlation ≥ .55; within-subject variation ≤ 15%).

General Procedures for Isokinetic Tests
The general procedures to follow when using isokinetic tests of muscular
strength are outlined here. The issues discussed are taken from the
reviews by Baltzopoulos (2008) and Wrigley and Strauss (2000).

Dynamometer calibration. An isokinetic dynamometer should be
calibrated prior to data collection to ensure the reliability and validity of the measures. The calibration procedure usually involves
suspending a range of loads of known mass from the dynamometer
arm at low velocities as well as using a goniometer to calibrate
angular position.
Gravity correction. Measurement error can be reduced by performing gravity correction prior to each test. Most dynamometers have
computerized procedures for gravity correction.
Order of test velocities. The typical testing order used in isokinetic
dynamometry is to begin with slow velocities and progress to fast
velocities.
Positioning of the subject. The subject should be positioned in such
a way that the recorded torque is generated by the musculature
crossing the joint of interest. This often means that contralateral
limbs and the torso should be stabilized with appropriate harnesses or belts. Similarly, the limb of interest should be secured to
the dynamometer arm to avoid any “overshoot” torque recordings
or impact injuries. The appropriate joint angles should be adopted,
even of those joints that may not appear to be involved in the
movement (particularly if the test involves biarticular muscles).
An important aspect of isokinetic testing is the alignment of the
axis of rotation of the dynamometer arm with that of the joint of
interest. Although anatomical axes may be difficult to establish
visually (and indeed are likely to move throughout the range of
motion), a prominent anatomical landmark is usually used (e.g.,
the lateral epicondyle of the femur for the knee joint). However, it
is important to establish appropriate alignment during submaximal
or maximal contractions given the potentially large change in joint
position between rest and contraction.

Instructions and feedback. The examiner should explain to the
subject the purpose of the test and emphasize that maximal
muscular effort should be given throughout the test. Familiarization trials should be provided before the data are collected at
each testing velocity. During the test, the examiner should provide
verbal instruction and encouragement, as well as visual feedback
of joint torque data.
Rest intervals. Rest intervals of 40 to 60 seconds are generally
recommended between contractions.

Maximal Muscular Strength of Knee Flexors
and Extensors
Maximal muscular strength is defined as the peak torque achieved during
the contractions at predetermined speeds.
Equipment (Maffiuletti et al. 2007)
Con-Trex dynamometer (Con-Trex MJ, CMV AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland)
with angular velocities of 60, 120 and 180° · s–1 for concentric contractions
and a velocity of –60° · s–1 for eccentric contractions. The torque values are
sampled at 100 Hertz.
Technique (Maffiuletti et al. 2007)
The subject sits in the chair of the dynamometer with an internal angle of
85° at the hip joint. The distal shin pad of the dynamometer arm is attached
2 to 3 centimeters (0.8 to 1.2 in.) proximal to the lateral malleolus of the
dominant leg. Straps are also fixed across the subject’s chest, pelvis, and
midthigh to prevent extraneous movement during the test. The subject
places each arm on the contralateral shoulder during each contraction to
avoid the involvement of the arms. Alignment between the dynamometer
rotational axis and that of the knee joint is checked prior to each test. During
the contractions, verbal encouragement and visual feedback (instantaneous
joint torque readings) are provided. The range of motion for each contraction is 70°—from 80° to 10° of knee flexion (0° corresponding to full knee
extension).
Procedure (Maffiuletti et al. 2007)
1. The subject performs a warm-up of 20 submaximal (20 to 80% of
perceived maximal effort) reciprocal concentric and eccentric contractions at low velocities (15° · s–1 for concentric, –15° · s–1 for eccentric).
2. The subject performs three continuous, reciprocal extension and
flexion contractions with maximal effort at a predetermined angular
velocity of 60° · s–1.

3. The subject rests passively for 60 seconds.
4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated at angular velocities of 120 and 180° · s–1.
5. The subject performs three alternating isometric contractions for the
knee extensors and flexors (60° flexion) with a 60-second passive
recovery after each one.
6. The subject performs three maximal eccentric contractions of the
knee extensors at an angular velocity of –60° · s–1; contractions are
separated by 60 seconds of passive rest.
7. The subject repeats step 6 for the knee flexors.
Reliability
For both concentric and eccentric peak torque values achieved by the knee
extensors, Maffiuletti and colleagues (2007) reported test–retest correlations
of ≥.99 at angular velocities of 60, 120, 180 and –60° · s–1 in a group of
recreationally active men and women. The within-subject variations were
2.8, 1.9 and 1.9% for the concentric contractions at angular velocities of
60, 120, and 180° · s–1, respectively; a value of 3.4% was reported for the
eccentric contraction. Very similar test–retest correlations were reported
for the knee flexors (≥.99). However, the within-subject variations were
slightly greater; values of 3.6, 2.9, and 2.7% were reported for the concentric contractions at angular velocities of 60, 120, and 180° · s–1, respectively.
Table 7.4 provides descriptive data for peak knee flexion and extension
torques collected from various athletes using the isokinetic test discussed
here.

Professional Applications

Many tests of maximal muscular strength are available, each with its own benefits and limitations. No one test should be regarded as the gold standard for
maximal muscular strength. Rather, the fitness professional should determine
the utility of each test based on the subject population, the mechanical specificity between the test and the performance of interest, available equipment,
ease of data analysis and interpretation, and time available.
The time available refers not only to that for the specific testing session, but
also for the recovery that the subject may require following the test. As mentioned earlier, high-intensity movements involving the SSC can result in fatigue
that lasts for days (Nicol et al. 2006). This is an important consideration given
that most sporting movements involve the SSC and therefore a test of maximal
muscular strength that demonstrates high levels of mechanical specificity is likely
to involve this action as well. The significant fatigue following the completion of

the test may preclude its regular administration during the athlete’s wider training program. This highlights the need to carefully plan the placement of testing
sessions within an athlete’s long-term training cycle.
When to administer a test during an athlete’s training program is also an
important consideration. It would appear practical to administer tests at the
completion of a mesocycle to establish the effectiveness of the training period.
However, researchers have identified possible lag times in the improvements
accrued from a period of training—improvements in specific physical capacities
such as maximal muscular strength may not be realized immediately following
the completion of a specific mesocycle (Siff 2000; Stone, Stone, and Sands
2007).
The timing of improvements elicited by a specific mesocycle of training may
be determined in part by the specificity between the test of maximal muscular
strength and the training exercises used in the program. This was demonstrated
by Abernethy and Jürimäe (1996), who reported that a dynamic isoinertial
test of maximal muscular strength was better than either an isometric or an
isokinetic test in tracking the changes in strength elicited from a resistance
training program comprising isoinertial exercises.
The selection of a nonspecific test of maximal muscular strength may cause
the fitness professional to erroneously label a training program as ineffective.
Clearly, tests of maximal muscular strength are not interchangeable; once the
professional has identified the most appropriate test given the circumstances,
only this test should be administered when a measure of maximal muscular
strength is required. Failure to use the same test for a specific physical capacity prevents the professional from effectively monitoring the athlete’s progress.
For the tests of maximal muscular strength reviewed here, large correlations have been reported between the test scores and performance measures
regardless of whether the tests are isoinertial, isometric, or isokinetic. However,
authors have called for tests of strength to be validated through the relationships
between the changes in the test scores and those of performance measures
following an intervention (Abernethy, Wilson, and Logan 1995; Murphy and Wilson
1997). Unfortunately, such analyses are largely absent from the literature. Where
the relationships between the tests and performance measures have been
reported, dynamic isoinertial tests appear to be better at tracking changes in
dynamic performance, as the principle of mechanical specificity would dictate.
Regardless of the type of strength test used, and at what point during the
athlete’s training program it is administered, the fitness professional must
administer the test consistently (e.g., warm-up, instructions during the test,
postures adopted during the test, time of day the test is performed). This will
ensure the effective recording and monitoring of the athlete’s strength.


Muscular Strength

Summary
■■

■■

■■

■■

■■

Maximal muscular strength can be defined as the ability of a muscle
or group of muscles to produce a maximal force or torque against
an external resistance under specific conditions defined by posture,
muscle action, and movement velocity.
The fitness professional should determine the utility of a maximal
muscular strength test based on the subject population, the mechanical specificity between the test and the performance of interest, and
the equipment and time available.
Fitness professionals should measure values of maximal muscular
strength directly rather than predicting them from multiple repetitions performed with submaximal loads.
Reliability is crucial for any physical test. The magnitude of a change
in muscular strength required for a real change to have occurred following an intervention can be determined from reliability statistics,
and sample sizes for future studies can also be computed (Hopkins
2000). As such, the reliability of tests of maximal muscular strength
and muscular strength endurance are important for both fitness professionals and researchers. Hopkins (2000) noted the following three
important reliability statistics:
1. Systematic bias (a change in the mean between consecutive test
scores)
2. Within-subject variation
3. Test–retest correlation (the intraclass correlation as opposed to
bivariate statistics should be used)
Without reliability statistics, a fitness professional cannot make
informed decisions about the utility of a strength test for a given
subject population. Many of the tests reviewed here have associated
test–retest correlations, although many of these are bivariate statistics
(Pearson’s r), which limits the comparisons of the tests. Few of the
tests have systematic bias or within-subject variations reported. This
is a substantial omission from the literature and one that should be
addressed in future research.
The fitness professional must administer tests consistently (e.g.,
warm-up, instructions during the test, postures adopted during the
test, time of day the test is performed).
