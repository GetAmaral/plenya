## Chapter 8: Muscular Endurance

Muscular Endurance
Gavin L. Moir, PhD

Chapter 7 introduced muscular strength as an important aspect of both
health and athletic performance. The selection of an appropriate test of
muscular strength should concern fitness professionals dealing with athletic, clinical, and even general populations. This chapter focuses on tests
of muscular endurance.
Tests of muscular endurance are not often administered to athletic populations, certainly in comparison to tests of maximal muscular strength. However, muscular endurance tests commonly appear in the battery of physical
tests administered to children, military and law enforcement personnel, and
firefighters (Baumgartner et al. 2007; Hoffman 2006); in fact, the outcome
scores for many of these tests are used as minimum entry standards. Such
tests typically involve large numbers of subjects being tested concurrently,
and so they are generally easy to administer and interpret. As a result of
the size of these populations, extensive normative data sets are available
for many tests of muscular endurance. This chapter outlines the appropriate methods for testing muscular endurance and identifies the associated
reliability and validity statistics. We begin, however, by defining muscular
endurance.

Definition of Muscular Endurance
Muscular strength is often equated with muscular force and can be defined
as the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to produce a force against an
external resistance (Siff 2000; Stone, Stone, and Sands 2007; Zatsiorsky
1995). This implies that the expression of muscular strength lies along a
continuum from zero (no force generated) to maximal force production
(maximal muscular strength). The physiological and mechanical factors
influencing the expression of muscular strength are discussed in chapter 7.

These factors included the contraction type (isometric, eccentric, concentric), the architectural characteristics of the muscle fibers (cross-sectional
area, pennation angle), the fiber type, and the contractile history (fatigue,
postactivation potentiation). From this discussion, maximal muscular
strength was defined as the ability to voluntarily produce a maximal force
or torque under specific conditions defined by muscle action, movement
velocity, and posture. We can now define muscular endurance as the ability to voluntarily produce force or torque repeatedly against submaximal
external resistances, or to sustain a required level of submaximal force in
a specific posture for as long as possible.
A relationship exists between maximal muscular strength and muscular
endurance (Reynolds, Gordon, and Robergs 2006). Indeed, this relationship
forms the basis of the prediction equations used to estimate a 1RM value
from multiple submaximal lifts performed in a specific test, as highlighted
in chapter 7. In general, the outcome of muscular endurance tests in which
repetitions are continued to failure with an absolute load are strongly
related to maximal muscular strength; stronger people can perform a greater
number of repetitions and therefore a greater amount of work (Stone et
al. 2006; Zatsiorsky 1995). Conversely, matching the load to the strength
of the subject results in similar numbers of repetitions among subjects,
regardless of strength.
The definition of muscular endurance presented here relates to the two
divergent testing methods that are often used to test muscular endurance.
The first method requires the subject to perform as many repetitions as possible against a submaximal load until volitional failure using both eccentric
and concentric contractions (e.g., push-ups to failure). The second method
requires the subject to maintain a prespecified posture for as long as possible
and therefore involves predominantly isometric contractions (e.g., flexedarm hang). Despite the quantitative and qualitative differences between
these two broad methods of evaluating muscular endurance, the defining
characteristic of both is the ability of the active musculature to resist fatigue,
defined as a reversible decline in muscle performance associated with muscle
activity that is marked by a progressive reduction in the force developed by
a muscle (Allen, Lamb, and Westerblad 2008).
One issue to be addressed in relation to the definition of muscular endurance is the determination of the submaximal loads during tests in which the
number of repetitions achieved before volitional failure is the dependent
variable. The selection of submaximal loads can be based on a percentage
of body mass (Baumgartner et al. 2002), a percentage of maximal muscular
strength (Mazzetti et al. 2000; Rana et al. 2008; Woods, Pate, and Burgess
1992), or an absolute load (Baker and Newton 2006; Mayhew et al. 2004;
Vescovi, Murray, and Van Heest 2007). Each of these methods has inherent problems. For example, using a load relative to body mass assumes a
linear relationship between body mass and muscular strength and does not


Muscular Endurance

accurately account for differences in body composition among subjects.
Conversely, basing the load on a percentage of maximal muscular strength
requires that the subject initially complete a 1RM test and therefore increases
the length of the testing sessions.
Some authors have questioned the validity of relative tests of muscular
endurance, suggesting that rarely in sporting or daily activities are loads
relative to maximal muscular strength or even body mass encountered
(Stone et al. 2006). Absolute loads, where the external load is the same for
each subject are more common. However, a problem with using absolute
loads to measure muscular endurance is that the load may be too heavy
for some subjects, which risks changing the test to one of maximal strength
rather than muscular endurance. Indeed, Kraemer and colleagues (2002)
recommended that 10 to 25 or more repetitions be required for an exercise
emphasizing muscular endurance. These numbers can be used as a guide
when using a test of muscular endurance based on repetitions to failure.
Another factor for consideration is that of the cadence of the repetitions
performed during a test using repetitions to failure. LaChance and Hortobagyi (1994) reported that the selection of a cadence can have a significant
effect on the number of repetitions performed during strength exercise.
However, very few of the published tests of muscular endurance specify a
cadence, allowing the subjects to set their own. Failure to specify a cadence
could reduce the reliability of the test, whereas selecting one may compromise the external validity of the test. Both of these situations can limit the
ability of the test to track changes in a person’s performance across time.
Other tests of muscular endurance require the subject to maintain a
prespecified posture for as long as possible using isometric contractions. At
issue is the time the subjects are required to hold the posture for the test to
be a measure of muscular endurance. Previously it was noted that, when
an external load is being moved repeatedly, a minimum number of repetitions is required to qualify a test as a measure of muscular endurance; an
equivalent time threshold is difficult to determine for tests in which subjects
must maintain a specific posture.
As with all isometric tests of muscular strength, the choice of posture,
and therefore joint angle, is important because the length–tension relationship of a muscle has a significant impact on the expression of strength
(Rassier, MacIntosh, and Herzog 1999). The issue of the most appropriate
posture to adopt during the test also arises. The fitness professional should
determine the utility of a specific test in relation to the postures adopted
in the performance for which the subject is being trained, as the principle
of specificity would dictate. This requires a thorough needs analysis of the
performance activity before selecting a test.
Tests of muscular endurance should not be used interchangeably because
only moderate correlations have been reported between tests, even when
the active musculature involved appears to be similar (Clemons et al. 2004;

195


196

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Halet et al. 2009; Sherman and Barfield 2006). This reflects the importance
of the specificity of the tests and also highlights the need to select the test
carefully and to use the same test when tracking muscular endurance over
time in the same person, or when comparing the muscular endurance of
various people. Failure to use the same test will negate the possibility of
effectively monitoring clients’ progress.

Field Tests for Muscular Endurance
The majority of field tests of muscular endurance presented in the literature
are specific to the abdominal musculature and that of the upper body. The
tests discussed here include the bench press, push-up, pull-up, sit-up, and
leg press or squat, all of which are performed to failure. The flexed-arm
hang, a posture-specific isometric test, is also discussed. The methods for
selecting the external resistance used in these tests are discussed where
appropriate. Where there are multiple forms of the same test available (e.g.,
bench press), only those protocols with published reliability and validity
data will be discussed in detail.

Bench Press to Failure (Load as a Percentage of Body
Mass)
Baumgartner and colleagues (2002) had male and female college-aged
men and women perform repetitions to failure on a machine weight bench
press. The load for the men was 70% of body mass; the load for the women
was 40%. Although no reliability data were reported for the test, the men
(average repetitions: 15.2) produced significantly greater repetitions than
the women did (average repetitions: 13.6). Although these average values
tend to fall within the prescribed repetitions for strength endurance as outlined by Kraemer and colleagues (2002), there was a very large range of
repetitions; some subjects were unable to achieve a single repetition with
the selected loads. Therefore, the selection of a load equivalent to 70% and
40% of body mass for men and women, respectively, may limit the validity
of this test for the general population.

Bench Press to Failure (Load as a Percentage of 1RM)
Mazzetti and colleagues (2000) used repetitions to failure with a load equivalent to 80% of 1RM in moderately trained men employing free weights. The
authors reported that the number of repetitions achieved (six to eight) did
not change following 12 weeks of resistance training, although significant
increases in 1RM values did occur.
Baker (2009) had well-trained rugby league players perform repetitions
to failure using a load equivalent to 60% of 1RM; the exercise was performed in a Smith-type machine. The number of repetitions performed was


Muscular Endurance

not able to differentiate performance level in rugby league players, despite
both the elite and lower-level players achieving more than 20 repetitions
on average during the test.
Adams and colleagues (2000) used a free-weight bench press to volitional
failure performed with a load equivalent to 50% of 1RM in older females
(mean age: 51 years). The subjects in this study were able to achieve more
than 20 repetitions on average (range: 10 to 30).
Woods, Pate, and Burgess (1992) tested upper body muscular endurance
using repetitions to failure with a load equivalent to 50% of 1RM in prepubescent boys and girls (mean age: 10 years). The exercise was performed
on a weight machine. The subjects achieved an average of 18.3 repetitions
(boys’ mean: 19.9; girls’ mean: 17.3). Unfortunately, there are no published
reliability data for repetitions to volitional failure in the bench press when
loads relative to maximal muscular strength are used.

Bench Press to Failure (Absolute Load)
Vescovi, Murray, and Van Heest (2007) used a load of 150 pounds (68 kg)
to measure the muscular endurance of well-trained ice hockey players
during a free-weight bench press exercise. The subjects were required to
lift at a cadence of 50 repetitions per minute during the test, which was
terminated when the subject could no longer maintain this cadence. The
number of repetitions achieved prior to failure allowed the researchers to
differentiate among playing positions: goalkeepers achieved an average of
3.3 repetitions, and defensemen achieved an average of 9.2 repetitions.
Mayhew and colleagues (2004) used a load of 225 pounds (102 kg) in the
bench press with NCAA Division II American football players. Although no
set cadence was used, the subjects were encouraged to take no more than
a 2-second pause between repetitions. A repetition was counted if the bar
touched the chest, was not bounced from the chest, and was returned to
full elbow extension. The players were able to perform an average of 11.7
repetitions before failure.
Other researchers reported an average of 7.2 repetitions in the same test
using a similar subject sample (Chapman, Whitehead, and Binkert 1998).
Baker (2009), using the number of repetitions performed with a load of
225 pounds (102 kg), was able to differentiate among rugby league players
of differing playing abilities, but players in the lower divisions achieved a
low number of repetitions (an average of 5.9).
Given that the recommendation for an exercise to develop muscular
endurance is a minimum of 10 repetitions (Kraemer et al. 2002), these
absolute loads would appear to be inappropriate for measuring muscular
endurance in many athletic subjects. Furthermore, there is no reported reliability for the bench press to failure performed with a load of 225 pounds
(102 kg) despite its widespread use, particularly in American football (Chapman, Whitehead, and Binkert 1998; Mayhew et al. 2004).

Bench Press to Failure With an Absolute Load
of 132 Pounds (60 kg)
Baker and Newton (2006) used a load of 132 pounds (60 kg) during a
bench press movement performed using free weights to test the muscular
endurance of well-trained rugby league players. The protocol employed by
these researchers is discussed here.
Technique (Earle and Baechle 2008)
The subject lies supine on the bench with the head, shoulders, and buttocks
in contact with the bench and both feet in contact with the floor (five-point
contact). The bar is grasped with a closed, pronated grip slightly wider than
shoulder width. The spotter assists the subject in removing the bar to the
beginning position, where the bar is held with the elbows extended. Each
repetition begins from this position. The bar is lowered to touch the chest at
around the level of the nipple, and is then raised in a continuous movement
until the elbows are fully extended (see figure 8.1). During the movement,
the five contact points should be maintained, and the subject should not
bounce the bar from the chest at the lowest part of the movement.
Procedure (Baker and Newton 2006)
1. In their study, Baker and Newton (2006) had rugby athletes perform
the muscular endurance test after completing a 1RM bench press test.
However, the fitness professional should determine an appropriate
warm-up routine that avoids fatigue.

2. The barbell is loaded to 132 pounds (60 kg).
3. The subject is required to perform as many repetitions as possible until
volitional failure or technique deterioration. No cadence is specified
for this test, but the subject is prohibited from resting between repetitions.
Reliability
A test–retest correlation coefficient of .94 has been reported for repetitions
to failure with an absolute load of 132 pounds (60 kg) performed with no
set cadence in rugby league players (Baker and Newton 2006).
Validity
The number of repetitions achieved in this test was found to differentiate
among playing abilities in rugby league players; elite players achieved an
average of 35.6 repetitions before test termination, whereas lower-level
players achieved an average of 23.8 repetitions (Baker and Newton 2006).
These repetitions are closely aligned to those recommended in the literature
for muscular endurance (Kraemer et al. 2002). No data are available for
athletic females using this test.
The absolute load of 132 pounds (60 kg) may be too heavy for the general
population. An alternative would be the YMCA bench press test, which
specifies a load of 80 pounds (36.3 kg) for men and 35 pounds (15.9) for
women (Hoffman 2006). This test follows a set cadence of 30 repetitions
per minute. Table 8.1 shows normative values for repetitions achieved by
the general population in the YMCA bench press test to failure.

Push-Ups to Failure
Procedure (Baumgartner et al. 2002)
1. The subject adopts a prone position on the floor with the hands placed
shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward, and elbows pointing
backward (figure 8.2).
2. From the starting position the subject pushes up to full arm extension
with the body straight, such that a straight line can be drawn from
the shoulder joint to the ankle joint (this is the up position).
3. The subject then lowers until all of the body from the chest to the
thighs makes contact with the floor.
4. The subject then pushes up to full arm extension, keeping the body
straight.
5. The subject continues the exercise at a comfortable rate (20 to 30
repetitions per minute) until no more push-ups can be performed
with the correct form.
6. A push-up is counted when the subject is in the up position, and no
resting is allowed between repetitions.
Reliability
Test–rest correlation coefficients of .95 and .91 have been reported for this
test in college-aged men and women, respectively (Baumgartner et al. 2002).
Validity
Williford and colleagues (1999) reported that the number of push-ups
before failure (41) was a strong indicator of performance during a specific
firefighting task in a group of firefighters. The number of repetitions performed during push-ups to failure at a cadence of 50 repetitions per minute
was able to differentiate ice hockey playing positions; goalkeepers achieved
22.7 repetitions and defensemen achieved 26.6 repetitions (Vescovi et al.
2007). Very large correlations (r = .80 to .87) between push-ups to failure
and bench press to failure have been reported in both college-aged men
and women (Baumgartner et al. 2002). In this study the average number
of push-up repetitions for the men was 26.4; the average number for the
women was 9.5.
Other researchers provided a modification to the push-up for women
(see figure 8.3), allowing them to place the knees on the floor with the feet
crossed behind (Boland et al. 2009). This allowed the women to achieve
more than 20 repetitions on average. The test can be modified for children
by having them begin the test in the push-up position and descend until

the elbow joint is at 90°, repeating this process at a cadence of 20 push-ups
per minute (Saint Romain and Mahar 2001). This modified test has been
shown to have a test–retest correlation greater than .97 (Saint Romain and
Mahar 2001).
Some examiners use the number of push-ups completed in 60 seconds
as a measure of muscular endurance. This measure is used for law enforcement personnel (Hoffman 2006) and has been shown to differentiate among
athletes from diverse sports (Rivera, Rivera-Brown, and Frontera 1998).
Military personnel are often assessed on the number of push-ups completed
in 120 seconds (Hoffman 2006). Normative values for push-ups to failure
for various populations are shown in tables 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4.

Pull-Ups to Failure
Procedure (Hoffman 2006)
1. The subject begins by hanging from the bar with arms straight and an
overhand grip (see figure 8.4a).
2. The subject pulls the body upward until the chin is above the bar (see
figure 8.4b).
3. The subject returns to the starting position.
4. Any swinging movements during the exercise should be avoided.
5. The number of repetitions before volitional failure is recorded.
Reliability
High test–retest correlation coefficients (>.83) have been reported for the
pull-up test in both male and female schoolchildren (Engelman and Morrow
1991). However, there are no published data assessing the reliability of the
test for adults. Furthermore, the width that the hands should be placed
apart is not always specified in the published literature. This variable could
affect the reliability of the test and should be controlled for by the examiner.
Validity
The number of pull-ups completed before failure (nine) was found to be
a strong indicator of performance during a specific firefighting task in a
group of firefighters (Williford et al. 1999). Elsewhere an increase in pullups was reported in prepubescent girls and boys (mean age: 8.4 years) who
followed an eight-week resistance training program (Siegel, Camaione, and
Manfredi 1989).
A modified version of the test performed on a climbing board has been
shown to differentiate among sport climbers of various levels (Grant et al.
1996; 2001). Similarly, a modified version is available for use with children,
in which the subject starts lying on the back and pulls up against a bar placed
on a stand (figure 8.5). This modified pull-up has been shown to be both
a valid and a reliable method of testing muscular endurance in children
(Saint Romain and Mahar 2001). Table 8.5 shows normative values for the
number of pull-ups achieved before failure in youth; table 8.6 shows the
performance evaluation for college-aged men in this test.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Partial Curl-Up
Technique
The partial curl-up requires the subject to lift the trunk as in the traditional
sit-up. This removes the influence of the hip flexor muscles (Baumgartner
et al. 2007). Typically, the test requires the subject to perform as many
repetitions as possible within a specified time, such as 60 seconds or 120
seconds, and a specific cadence is often set.
Procedure (Hoffman 2006)
1. With tape, place two parallel lines on the floor 10 centimeters (4 in.)
apart. (Some researchers place the lines 12 centimeters [4.7 in.] apart
[Grant et al. 2001]).
2. The subject starts on the back with the knees bent and the arms fully
extended at the sides with fingers contacting the first line (see figure
8.6a).
3. The subject starts the exercise by curling the upper back so that both
middle fingers touch the second tape mark 10 centimeters (4 in.) away
(see figure 8.6b) while keeping the feet on the floor.
4. The subject performs as many repetitions as possible in 60 seconds
at a cadence of 20 curl-ups per minute (40 beats per minute). (Some
researchers have used a cadence of 50 beats per minute [Grant et al.
2001]).
Reliability
There are no published reliability data for this test.
Validity
The number of curl-ups completed in a 60-second period was shown to
differentiate among athletes from diverse sports (Rivera, Rivera-Brown,
and Frontera 1998). However, improvements in this test were not reported

Muscular Endurance

following an eight-week resistance training intervention completed by
prepubescent children (Siegel, Camaione, and Manfredi 1989). Similarly,
researchers have reported that the number of repetitions completed before
volitional failure was not able to differentiate performance abilities in sport
climbers (Grant et al. 1996; 2001) or playing position in rugby league players (Meir et al. 2001). Normative data for this test performed by the adult
general population are shown in table 8.7; data for youth are shown in
table 8.8; table 8.9 shows standard passing scores for police department
personnel in sit-ups achieved in 60 seconds.

Leg Press or Squats to Failure (Load as a Percentage
of 1RM)
Studies using isoinertial measures of muscular endurance for the lower
body musculature, in which repetitions are performed to volitional failure,
tend to be performed on older subjects. The authors have used repetitions
with a load relative to the subjects’ 1RM, reporting values from 60 to 90%
(Adams et al. 2000; Foldvari et al. 2000; Henwood, Riek, and Taafe 2008;
Rana et al. 2008). In a group of older women (mean age: 51.0 years), Adams
and colleagues (2000) reported that 7 to 18 repetitions were achieved in
the leg press movement performed with a load equivalent to 70% of 1RM.
Foldvari and colleagues (2000) reported a range of repetitions between 0
and 26 in older women (mean age: 74.8 years) performing the leg press
with a load equivalent to 90% of 1RM. One might question the validity of
this load for some of the subjects performing a muscular endurance test,
particularly given the number of repetitions achieved by some. Interestingly,

the number of repetitions achieved was not significantly related to subjects’
functional status. Henwood and colleagues (2008) reported that the number
of repetitions achieved using a load equivalent to 70% of 1RM performed
in a leg press machine did not change following a 22-week resistance training program that elicited improvements in functional performance tasks in
a mixed group of older (65 to 84 years) men and women. Unfortunately,
the number of repetitions achieved was not reported.


Muscular Endurance

In contrast, Rana and colleagues (2008) reported an increase in the
number of repetitions performed during the back squat with a load equivalent to 60% of 1RM following a six-week resistance training program in
college-aged women. Approximately 15 repetitions were performed in
the test prior to the resistance training program, and more than 20 were
performed posttraining.
It would appear from this limited sample of studies that a load equivalent to 70% of 1RM or below is required to allow sufficient repetitions for
a test of muscular endurance given the range of repetitions required for a
resistance training exercise emphasizing muscular endurance. However, no
reliability data are reported for any of the tests discussed here.
As mentioned previously, the limitations of using a test of muscular
endurance with external loads relative to maximal muscular strength are
that such a test requires the subject to perform a 1RM test, and loads relative to maximal strength are not often encountered in activities of daily
living or sport. Unfortunately, no data on using muscular endurance tests
of the lower body with absolute loads are available.

Flexed-Arm Hang
The flexed-arm hang field test for muscular endurance differs from those
discussed so far in that the outcome is the time a specific posture is held
as opposed to the number of repetitions performed. Variations in the
technique can be used in this test. For example, the bar can be grasped
with an overhand or underhand grip. Similarly, variations in the posture
have been reported in the literature,
such as requiring that the chin be
maintained above the bar or below
the bar with various elbow angles
(Clemons et al. 2004). The variant
discussed here—using an overhand
grip and maintaining the chin above
the bar—is the most common in the
literature (see figure 8.7).
Procedure (Hoffman 2006)
1. A bar that is higher than the
subject’s standing height is
required.
2. The subject grasps the bar with
an overhand grip wrapping the
thumbs around the bar. (Note
that there is no mention of the
width of the grip to be used.

Figure 8.7 Starting position used in the
flexed-arm hang test.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

However, the examiner should record this width and maintain consistency across testing sessions.)
3. With assistance from spotters, the subject is raised to a height at which
the chin is above, but not touching, the bar (see figure 8.7).
4. The subject is required to hang without support for as long as possible.
The time is recorded from when the spotters remove their support
until the chin touches or falls below the bar.
Reliability
A test–retest correlation of .97 was reported for the time achieved in the
flexed-arm hang test performed by women (Clemons et al. 2004).
Validity
The flexed-arm hang test has been used to show sex differences among
adolescent distance runners (Eisenmann and Malina 2003). Similarly,
Siegel, Camaione, and Manfredi (1989) reported that the time of the flexedarm hang increased following the completion of an eight-week resistance
training program in prepubescent girls and boys (mean age: 8.4 years). A
modified version of the test has been performed on a climbing board; the
time achieved was able to differentiate among elite and recreational sport
climbers (Grant et al. 1996).
Other researchers have noted that the performance in the flexed-arm
hang is unrelated to other tests of upper body muscular endurance in women
and was more strongly related to a test of maximal muscular strength (Clemons et al. 2004). The average time achieved by the subjects in this study
was 6.1 seconds, whereas an average of 13.8 repetitions was achieved in
the test of muscular endurance (lat-pulldowns to failure with an external
load equivalent to 70% of 1RM). This may reflect the importance of determining a minimum time required for a test to be considered a measure of
muscular endurance, just as a minimum number of repetitions is required
when the endurance test requires the external load to be moved repeatedly.
Normative values for the flexed-arm hang test in youth are shown in
table 8.10.

Laboratory Tests for Muscular Endurance
There are many laboratory tests of muscular endurance, all of which require
the use of dynamometers. All of these tests are specific to the research question of interest, and few standardized procedures have been published. The
laboratory test for muscular endurance discussed here is an isokinetic test
requiring a dynamometer. Issues relating to isokinetic dynamometry are
addressed in chapter 7.

Isokinetic Laboratory Test for
Muscular Endurance
The specific test discussed here assesses the muscular endurance of the
knee flexors and extensors at a velocity of 180° · s–1. Muscular endurance
is determined from the change in peak torque during a series of repeated
contractions.
Equipment and Technique (Maffiuletti et al. 2007)
The same equipment and technique used in isokinetic tests of maximal
muscular strength.
Procedure (Maffiuletti et al. 2007)
1. The subject completes the procedure outlined for isokinetic tests of
maximal muscular strength (refer to chapter 7).

2. The subject performs 20 reciprocal extension and flexion contractions
at an angular velocity of 180° · s–1.
3. Fatigue is defined in two ways: (a) Peak torque values achieved in
contractions 2 through 5 and contractions 17 through 20 are averaged, and the percent difference between these averages (percentage
loss) represents fatigue; and (b) the decline in peak torque between
contraction 2 and contraction 20 via the negative slope is calculated
using linear regression analysis.
Reliability
Maffiuletti and colleagues (2007) reported a test–retest correlation of .81 for
fatigue expressed as a percentage loss, while a value of .78 was reported for
the negative slope calculation of fatigue in a group of recreationally active
men and women.
Validity
There are no published validity data for this test.

Comparing Muscular Endurance Measurement
Methods
Table 8.11 summarizes the field and laboratory tests that have been discussed in this chapter and provides a rating of the tests in terms of the type
of muscular contraction involved, the resources required, published validity and reliability, published normative data, ease of administration, and
potential skill requirements of the subject.

Professional Applications

As with most other physical capacities, many tests are available for measuring
muscular endurance. The field tests discussed here are easy to administer,
and many of them involve no equipment at all. Moreover, the analysis and
interpretation of the data should pose no problems to the fitness professional.
Certainly, the field tests of muscular endurance appear to be well suited to
large groups. However, the fitness professional needs to consider the principle
of specificity and choose a test that matches the performance for which the
subject is training.
Warm-ups to be used prior to tests of muscular endurance are not adequately
addressed in the literature. Based on the order in which tests should be
administered as part of a testing battery, Harman (2008) proposed that tests
of muscular endurance follow agility, maximal power and strength, and sprint
tests. This order should ensure that the subject is sufficiently warmed up prior


214

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments
(continued)

to the muscular endurance test, although the examiner should avoid fatiguing
the subject. (Chapter 7 outlines an appropriate warm-up.)
Tests of muscular endurance of the upper body musculature have been
performed in the same session as, but following, tests of maximal muscular
strength with well-trained athletes (Baker and Newton 2006). This protocol may
be specific to the upper body musculature, which has been shown to recover
more quickly than that of the lower body in response to resistance training workouts (Hoffman et al. 1990), and therefore may not apply to muscular endurance
tests for the lower body. The examiner needs to consider the fatigue caused by
other tests used in a battery, particularly when eccentric and stretch–shortening
cycle activities are involved. Consistency in the administration of tests within
a battery should always be considered.
With tests of muscular endurance in which submaximal loads are moved
repeatedly until volitional fatigue, examiners should stipulate a minimum number
of repetitions to complete. Kraemer and colleagues (2002) recommended a
minimum of 10 repetitions of an exercise to develop muscular endurance, and
so this threshold would seem appropriate for tests of muscular endurance (Baker
and Newton 2006). This is an important point given that muscular strength is
proposed to lie along a continuum from zero (no force generated) to maximal
force production (maximal muscular strength); if an external load, whether
absolute or relative, can be moved only once, the test does not provide a valid
measure of muscular endurance.
This repetition threshold may bring the validity of some of the tests discussed
in this chapter into question (e.g., push-ups to failure, pull-ups to failure) when
performed by certain populations. Furthermore, the question arises of how long
the subject should hold a specific posture in tests such as the flexed-arm hang
for the test to be a valid measure of muscular endurance. For example, if a
subject is able to hold the posture for only two seconds, one could argue that
this is closer to the maximal force end of the strength continuum than it is to
the no force end. Therefore, the test is measuring maximal muscular strength.
The need to determine a minimal time threshold for holding a posture for a test
to be considered a valid measure of muscular endurance seems fraught with
difficulty and may therefore preclude the use of such tests.
The issue of cadence arises when subjects need to perform repetitions to
volitional failure. Failure to specify a cadence could reduce the reliability of
the test, whereas selecting one may compromise the external validity of the
test (rarely do people perform repetitive movements at a constant cadence in
activities of daily living or sport). Both of these situations can limit the ability
of the test to track changes in a person’s performance across time. LaChance
and Hortobagyi (1994) reported that a cadence had a significant effect on the
number of repetitions performed during strength exercises.
A solution to the cadence problem would be to allow subjects to set their own
cadences and so ensuring the external validity of the test while also recording
the time taken to achieve volitional failure. These data could provide some

information pertaining to the average power output achieved by the subject
during the test (the repetitions achieved represent the work performed, which,
when divided by the time taken, can provide the rate at which the work was
performed). This suggestion would be more appropriate when absolute external
loads are used, simplifying the calculations. This would also conform to the
suggestion of using absolute external loads given that rarely do people experience loads relative to their levels of maximal muscular strength or their body
mass in activities of daily living or sport (Stone et al. 2006).
Despite the proposed validity of using absolute loads in tests of muscular
endurance, these protocols may not accurately reflect the specific adaptations
following a training intervention. Specifically, a relationship exists between
maximal muscular strength and muscular endurance when the endurance test
requires that subjects move an absolute external load repeatedly (Stone, Stone,
and Sands 2007; Zatsiorsky 1995). This may lead to improvements in muscular
endurance simply in response to increases in maximal muscular strength, which
appears contrary to the principle of specificity.
As a result of all of these factors, the question could be raised: What useful
information is the fitness professional gaining from these tests that would not be
gleaned from other tests such as those measuring maximal muscular strength?
Given the greater time taken to administer many of the field tests of maximal
muscular strength, the reverse argument could be used: Why not just administer
a test of muscular endurance using repetitions to failure and calculate maximal
muscular strength? Certainly the field tests of muscular endurance are easy
to administer and lend themselves to large groups being tested concurrently.
However, it was noted in chapter 7 that the available prediction equations are
not entirely accurate, and so experts suggested that testing maximal strength
is better than predicting it from repetitions with a submaximal load.
The utility of tests of muscular endurance appears to be limited in athletic
populations, unless the fitness professional is overseeing the testing of a very
large number of athletes. In contrast, field tests of muscular endurance would
appear to be well suited for use with the general population.
Finally, although some tests of muscular endurance have been shown to
differentiate among athletes of differing performance levels, few of these field
tests have been used to track the changes in muscular endurance as a result
of specific training interventions, certainly in adults. Validation of strength
tests requires the assessment of the relationships between the changes in
the test scores and those of performance measures following an intervention
(Abernethy, Wilson, and Logan 1995; Murphy and Wilson 1997). As with most
other tests of strength, these analyses have not been performed with tests of
muscular endurance.

Muscular endurance is defined as the ability to voluntarily produce
force or torque repeatedly against submaximal external resistances or
to sustain a required level of submaximal force in a specific posture
for as long as possible.
Two types of tests are often used to measure muscular endurance,
both of which require the subject to resist fatigue:
1. Repetitions performed to volitional failure against a submaximal
external resistance
2. Maintaining a specified posture for as long as possible
Tests of muscular endurance are typically administered to large groups
of subjects such as schoolchildren, military and law enforcement
personnel, and firefighters.
The field tests used to measure muscular endurance are easy to
administer and interpret.
With field tests that involve repetitions to volitional failure, it would
appear that an absolute load rather than a relative load should be
used, particularly during the bench press exercise.
No research has been published investigating the use of absolute
external loads with lower body tests of muscular endurance.
Often, field tests of upper body muscular endurance (e.g., push-up and
pull-up tests) allow modifications for use with females and children.
The fitness professional should determine the utility of a test based
on the principle of specificity.
Once the test has been selected, it should be administered consistently
in terms of warm-up procedures, instructions to the subject, time of
administration, and so on.
