The principle of specificity suggests that human performance evaluation be
approached as a systematic, discriminatory process in which components
of physical fitness are independently tested, scored, and interpreted. This
principle is driven by the assumption that fitness attributes are not only
distinct but also specifically responsive to training variables. Because training is designed to address the unique conditions of a given sport or activity,
testing and evaluation should complement exercise prescription, and form
the objective foundation upon which the entire performance enhancement
process is monitored. The notion of specificity is particularly complex when
managing the factors associated with power production. In fact, muscular
power assessment and subsequent development has become one of the most
debated and widely deliberated topics across all segments of exercise science.
Power shares a robust association with movement on a continuum from
high performance athletics to geriatrics (Bean et al. 2002; Earles, Judge,
and Gunnarsson 1997), the measurement of which accounts for neuromuscular subtleties that are often overlooked in other measures of raw force
production. Many experts regard power output capacity as the best index
of coordinated human movement, chronic function or dysfunction (Evans
2000; Suzuki, Bean, and Fielding 2001; Puthoff and Nielsen 2007), or acute
deficiency (e.g., neuromuscular fatigue) (Nordlund, Thorstensson, and
Cresswell 2004; Racinais et al. 2007). Many also consider the manipulation
of variables to accommodate power adaptation as a principal training objective. To that end, a thorough understanding of the factors that influence
power production and explosive movement capacity provides a definitive
basis for monitoring, developing, and refining performance enhancement
programming.

Operationalizing Power
Among many practitioners and the general public, the term power has
emerged as a nonspecific designation of movement encompassing factors
of speed, strength, or both. In athletic contexts, various permutations of
the word power are used to characterize movement qualities or capacities
ranging from very-high-load, slow movement patterns (e.g., powerlifting) to
very-low-load, high-velocity activities (e.g., a powerful tennis serve). Despite
the lack of a mainstream consensus definition for power, it is recognized as
a clustering of neuromuscular factors related to maximal force production
and rate of force development.
The expression of power through coordinated movement is also contingent on external morphological and biomechanical factors including type
of muscle action, mass lifted (which may include body mass or limb mass
plus an external load), anthropometric characteristics (e.g., limb lengths),
muscle architecture (e.g., fiber composition, muscle pennation angle, fiber
cross-sectional area, and number of active sarcomeres in series), tendon
and connective tissue stiffness, joint range(s) of motion, and movement
distance (Cormie et al. 2011a). Despite these many factors that contribute
to power, athletes and practitioners have derived arbitrary means of “power
training,” with the intent to facilitate an adaptive response that translates
to augmented explosive movement capacity.
Considering that the term power typically evokes the perception of highspeed movement, many people are inclined to take the tenets of specificity
to literally mean “train fast, be fast.” However, to create the most strategic
methods of training and adaptation, it is vital to compartmentalize power
into the primary testable and trainable elements.
With the growing popularity of power training among strength and conditioning coaches, personal trainers, and athletes, a standardized evaluation
of power output or explosive movement performance is critical. Existing
methods range from basic field tests, to elaborate biomechanical assessments
in human performance laboratories, to in vitro activation and measurement
of force development in biopsied muscle fibers. Moreover, the industry
response to this increased interest in power testing and training has been
a surplus of products available to the public. Certainly, greater visibility
reflects a positive change in the field of exercise science and the performance
enhancement industry; however, methods of evaluating power must be
systematic and standardized to ensure the collection of valid, reliable data.
Such a system of testing would allow professionals to share norm-referenced
standards and to make formal, cross-sectional inspections of physiological and performance attributes (e.g., regression modeling to identify the
association between maximal force production and jumping ability across
athletic populations, while controlling for age, sex, body dimensions, and
training status).


Power

Mechanisms of Power Production and Expression
The mechanisms of power output production have received a great deal
of research attention. However, translation of empirical findings to performance enhancement outcomes is a distinct challenge to investigators,
and has led to confusion regarding practical application. The expression of
power through coordinated movement involves numerous physiological
attributes, intrinsic biomechanical factors, and external loading parameters.
Thus, although “maximal power” may be defined as the critical threshold
interaction between strength and speed (Cronin and Sleivert 2005), this is
only true in the specific context for which it is being examined. Depending
on the test used, muscular power is documented to be contingent on the
following intrinsic physiological factors:
■■

■■
■■
■■
■■

■■

■■
■■

■■

Availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stores within the specific
muscles being tested
Ratio of fast fibers (i.e., Type II fibers) to slow fibers (i.e., Type I fibers)
Whole muscle volume or cross-sectional area (CSA)
Muscle architecture (i.e., pennation angle)
Intramuscular coordination (i.e., recruitment of fibers within a given
muscle)
Intermuscular coordination (i.e., recruitment of synergistic agonist
muscles to perform a movement)
Coordinated timing and coactivation of antagonist musculature
Rate coding (i.e., axonal conduction velocity and stimulation frequency)
Stretch–shortening cycle (i.e., the active stretch of a muscle followed
by an immediate shortening)

In many cases it is also necessary to account for differences in body size
when examining power changes over time or among individuals. This is
because performance in most activities is suggested to be highly contingent
on a fitness-to-body-mass ratio (see chapter 1 for ways to normalize or
adjust fitness characteristics to body mass).
Although to some extent the principle of specificity is based on theoretical constructs, many professionals use it when generating test batteries and
as the basis for training prescriptions. However, when applied to muscular power output, the principle of specificity is complicated by numerous
interrelated factors. Therefore, it may be advisable not only to consider the
manifestation of power output as it is exhibited through explosive movement, but also to isolate the specific underlying physiological characteristics
that could prohibit or potentiate power adaptation. Thus, in contrast to
other discrete fitness attributes (e.g., maximal oxygen consumption), power

219

output should be evaluated using a systems approach that incorporates
multiple components related to absolute force production, rate of force
production, metabolic specificity, movement velocity, work capacity, and
body-mass-adjusted power.
Much research has been devoted to investigating the force–velocity
relationship. One of the most well-known characteristics of muscle tissue,
the force–velocity relationship exemplifies the interactions between muscle
contraction velocity and the magnitude of force production. Originally considered by A.V. Hill in 1938 using frog skeletal muscle, and later revised in
1964 (Hill 1964), this relationship was initially examined in, and applied
to, isolated muscle. Hill determined that a muscle contracts at a velocity
inversely proportional to the load. Many subsequent investigations have
confirmed this physiological phenomenon within isolated muscle, as well
as within muscle groups during dynamic movement. For the purpose of
this chapter, the force–velocity and power–velocity relationships will be
illustrated using such Hill-type models (Faulkner, Claflin, and McCully
1986) (see figure 9.1).
Hill-type models do not effectively characterize molecular contributions
and muscle architectural characteristics. Cross-bridge models (Wu and
Herzog 1999) and anatomically based structural models (Yucesoy et al.
2002) have also been proposed that take into account force responses at
the cellular level, as well as fiber arrangement and passive and elastic connective tissue properties, respectively.
Regardless of the interpretive model, the maximal velocity of a given
movement depends on the resistance applied to that movement. Specifically, maximal voluntary muscular contraction against a high load produces
slower velocities than maximal contractions against a light load. This tradeoff between velocity and force for coordinated movement is easily demonstrated during heavy resistance training in which extremely high loads are
lifted through a range of motion at slow velocities. At some point along this
continuum, the load may be great enough that velocity reaches zero, and
an isometric contraction is produced.
Moreover, any applied force that produces movement is defined not only
by the load encountered, but also by the velocity at which the dynamic
action takes place. For every submaximal exertion (i.e., against relative
intensities or loads less than maximal voluntary contraction) there is a
distinct maximal velocity that is producible. If the load is decreased to a
negligible extent, the potential velocity is maximized. At some point along
the force–velocity curve for every muscle action and subsequent movement,
there is a force-maximizing load at which velocity is extremely low but
dynamic force is at its greatest level. There is also a point along this curve at
which the instantaneous product of force and velocity may be maximized.
This product is known as muscular peak power, and although associated, it
is distinct from absolute strength and maximal movement speed. As noted in
figure 9.1, the apex of the power–velocity curve illustrates the expression of

peak power. Despite overlap among strength, speed, and consequent power
output, these parameters are discrete, trainable muscular fitness attributes.
According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration (Force = mass × acceleration) of an object, or
body. When force is applied to move an object, as in weightlifting, it must
not only offset the gravitational force elicited by the mass of the object, but
also facilitate movement in the direction opposite to that of gravitational
force. In reference to resistance training, a frequently used expression is
muscular strength, which is defined as the maximal ability to generate force
through a specific movement pattern, velocity, or rate of force production
(Stone et al. 2000).
Muscle strength and power are often confused as synonymous; however, these attributes are in fact distinct, because high force production
may occur in the absence of movement (e.g., isometric muscle action),
whereas power cannot. Conversely, dynamic muscle action is a necessary
component of power production, and as such, power is the manifestation
of work accomplished (i.e., Work = force × distance) per unit of time. In
the case of isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), force is very
high, but power is zero because no movement occurs and thus no work is
accomplished. Ultimately, an increase in power production capacity enables a
given muscle to produce the same amount of work in less time, or a greater

221


222

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

magnitude of work in the same time. Muscular power is then exhibited by
virtually all muscle actions that produce a velocity, and may be more easily
defined as the rate of muscular force production (Power = force × velocity)
throughout a range of motion (Cronin and Sleivert 2005).
Although this definition generally indicates linear movement, it is important to note that displacement may also be angular, and respective work
may be accomplished through angular movement, such as across a joint
or with an ergometer (e.g., cycling, rowing). During angular displacement,
rotational speed (i.e., angular velocity) and torque are fundamental properties not present with linear displacement. Angular velocity is measured
in radians per second (rad/s), and torque is measured in newton-meters,
thus yielding this equation for angular work: Work = torque × angular
displacement. Although this represents a different computation for determining work, the fundamental principles that apply to quantifying power
are still used: Power = work / time. As will be discussed, several tests that
use rotational work to derive power estimates have received a great deal
of research attention.
Because the topic of muscular power capacity has gained popularity in
the world of performance enhancement, it should therefore be examined
and delineated with distinct and equitable emphases to that of absolute
force production and maximal speed of movement. However, as is the case
for both strength and speed, there are a number of task-specific methods
to test power that vary considerably with regard to muscle action and the
time course over which power is generated (i.e., duration that data collection occurs). These tests should not be used interchangeably because
the results may not reflect the same outcome or underlying pathways for
generating power output.
When generalizing or applying data for exercise prescription, fitness
professionals should keep in mind that power exhibited under one set
of conditions may not necessarily translate across other conditions (Atha
1981). Because power reflects the interaction between muscle force production and velocity, anything that alters either of these also directly modifies
power production capacity.
This chapter distinguishes between submaximal power output and the
ways to measure maximal power. Power ranges from 0 watts (W) in an
isometric contraction, to over 7,000 watts when an Olympic-caliber weightlifter performs a clean (Garhammer 1993). The continuum of dynamic
muscle actions and respective power outputs varies considerably across
this range, and thus it is imperative to differentiate the peak expression
capacities that coincide with human movements, as well as the appropriate testing methods.


Power

Types and Factors of Power
The breakdown of overt power output into the fundamental elements is
necessary not only for appropriately targeted testing, but also for the design
and refinement of sport performance programming (Cormie, McGuigan,
and Newton 2011b). Indeed, as is the case for all fitness or performance
attributes, pinpointing elements of deficiency is difficult if testing is not
broad based and sport specific. Therefore, testing for power requires an
understanding of the types of power, as well as the factors that comprise
power output and explosive coordinated movement. However, proper
evaluation also requires a thorough comprehension of the power-related
performance requirements associated with a given sport or activity. Thus,
fitness professionals must discriminate among the types of power by compartmentalizing them into categories based on metabolic requirements and
the time course through which power is produced (e.g., types of anaerobic
power and explosive, or instantaneous, power).
Fitness professionals also need to acknowledge those factors that contribute to power output or explosive coordinated movement, but may not be
traditionally considered an outcome of power expression, per se. Two such
factors that directly translate to powerful performance outcomes and may
be distinguished from overt power output are rate of force development
and reactive strength capacity. Unraveling these factors is necessary for
identifying the needs of the athlete, as well as for ensuring the systematic
prescription and refinement of training to maximize performance.

Anaerobic Power
The term anaerobic power is often used interchangeably with maximal power,
but may better reflect the rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) use over a
single (or multiple) maximal effort against a submaximal load. Anaerobic
activity occurs at the onset of exercise and is demonstrated as the accumulation of muscular work not attributable to aerobic metabolism. This
“oxygen deficit,” which is pronounced in the first minutes of moderate- to
high-intensity exercise, has been thoroughly characterized since the early
1910s (Krogh and Lindhard 1913).
.
Anaerobic activity also occurs at relative intensities that exceed VO2max,
thus requiring discrete fuel sources that depend directly on the degree of
exercise intensity. Specifically, the anaerobic glycolytic (i.e., the lactic acid
system) and phosphocreatine systems (i.e., PC system or alactic system) contribute ATP at a much faster rate than is possible by aerobic pathways. The
metabolic trade-off to this high rate of ATP turnover is that the energy sources
for anaerobic metabolism (glucose and glycogen) are limited and diminish
significantly faster than during lower-intensity exercise. The depletion of

energy substrate is particularly rapid for higher-intensity activities fueled by
the phosphocreatine system.
Depending on relative intensity (i.e., as expressed relative to maximal
force production), the onset of fatigue or muscular failure may occur after
a single repetition, or after as long as six seconds, when fueled by the
phosphocreatine system. Generally, any high-intensity anaerobic exercise
that exceeds this time course occurs through the metabolic processes of the
anaerobic glycolytic system, for up to approximately two minutes (see table
9.1). Beyond two minutes of exertion, additional work is progressively and
incrementally fueled by the aerobic system. Glycogen (i.e., stored carbohydrate), glucose (i.e., blood sugar), ATP, and phosphocreatine (i.e., stored
locally in the muscle tissue) are the primary energy sources for anaerobic
metabolism. Although they are available only in limited quantities, they are
replenished rapidly following bouts of recovery (i.e., three to five minutes for
ATP resynthesis, within eight minutes for creatine phosphate, and up to 24
hours for glycogen) (Friedman, Neufer, and Dohm 1991; Harris et al. 1976).
Evaluating maximal anaerobic capacity has been considered an important
component of physiological testing. Anaerobic power output may be evaluated on a continuum from instantaneous performance to power production
across longer time courses. Thus, the term peak anaerobic power may designate
the greatest output or production of work per a specific quantity of time.
Of the tests used to determine anaerobic power, several have received the
majority of attention from the sport science community. In particular, the
30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test (see page 229) has been the gold standard
test for power production capacity; its widespread appeal is largely due to
the ease of administration and its documented validity and reliability (Bar-


Power

Or 1987). As will be further discussed, this test allows for the computation
of peak power, anaerobic capacity, and anaerobic fatigue. Certainly, these
are all important components of anaerobic performance and have direct
application to most sporting events. However, this test is inherently limited
because it may not be a sufficient predictor of instantaneous performance
attributes, which are regulated through neurological pathways. Further, it
is not biomechanically specific to any sport other than cycling, so there are
inherent limitations in its application to athletic scenarios in which body
mass is not supported, a fixed range of angular motion is not repeatedly
performed, or both.

Maximal Instantaneous Power
Maximal instantaneous power (Gollnick and Bayly 1986) may be generally
defined as the highest potential power attainable in a single movement or
repetition. Also known as maximal power, this attribute has been designated
as the greatest potential product of force production and velocity.
Given that maximal power is related to the capacity of the neuromuscular
system to develop a significant amount of force in a short period of time
(i.e., contingent largely on rate of force development), this may be considered the fundamental component of performance in activities requiring
maximal velocities with a constant load, especially at the point of impact or
release (e.g., kicking, punching, jumping). Further, this has been viewed as
an exceedingly important testing parameter and training objective in most
sport conditioning programs.
Most research attention has been devoted to the load–power relationship
in lower body compound movements such as the squat, clean, jump squat,
and vertical jump. Findings demonstrate that maximal power is expressed
at various percentages of peak force production, is largely contingent on the
type of movement, and may range anywhere from 0% of maximal force
production for the jump squat (i.e., no external additional load) (Cormie et
al. 2007), to 80% of 1RM for the power clean (Cormie et al. 2007). Conversely, for isoinertial contractions (i.e., constant resistance), maximal power
occurs at approximately 30% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction
(Josephson 1993). Of particular relevance to lower extremity activity, body
mass should be taken into account when measuring power output (i.e.,
added to, or considered a fraction of, the load lifted).

Rate of Force Development
Rate of force development (RFD)—also called rate of force production (RFP)
or rate of torque development (RTD)—may be considered the rate of rise
in contractile force (or torque) at the onset of contraction (Aagaard et al.
2002). RFD is illustrated using the slope of the force- or joint moment–time
curve (i.e., change in torque / change in time), as depicted in figure 9.2. The

peak rate of force production (PRFP) is then the steepest point on the slope
of the force–time curve, and represents the ability of a muscle (or group of
muscles) to rapidly generate force or tension (N · s–1). These attributes are
particularly significant for coordinated movements that require very fast
and forceful muscular contractions, such as sprinting and jumping. Such
activities require contractions in as little as 50 milliseconds, which is much
shorter than is typically required for maximal force production (i.e., > 400
ms) (Aagaard et al. 2002; Thorstensson et al. 1976). RFD is exceedingly
important for tasks associated with postural stabilization and balance, as well
as high-force, high-velocity eccentric tasks such as preventing slip-and-fall
accidents (Suetta et al. 2007).
An increase in RFD would represent an augmented ability to generate
force and ultimately lead to significantly higher absolute force production
over the same time course (Aagaard et al. 2002). More important, during
conditions that do not permit maximal force or power production (i.e.,
extremely rapid eccentric or concentric muscle action), the capacity to
develop a high degree of muscle force in a short time (i.e., high RFD) may
indicate superior performance (Suetta et al. 2004) as compared to absolute
strength or power. As demonstrated in figure 9.2, RFD may be significantly
improved in as little as 12 weeks of standard resistance training exercise,
among aging subjects.

Reactive Strength
The expression of muscular power is also contingent on factors unrelated to
the contractile physiology of muscle. Specifically, noncontractile elements of


Power

the musculotendinous unit contribute significantly to the storage of elastic
energy during eccentric contractions and the subsequent performance of
concentric muscle actions and explosive movements (Wilson, Murphy, and
Pryor 1994). Further, a direct link has been documented between musculotendinous stiffness (MTS) and the potential energy that may be used as
a contributing synergistic factor during such concentric, explosive actions
(Chelly and Denis 2001).
Over the last decade a great deal of attention has been devoted to the
topic of reactive strength, both from a research perspective and among
professionals designing exercise programs. Part of this interest is due to
the purported adaptability of this anatomical property through strategic
training approaches. Specifically, research has demonstrated that MTS
may be specifically adapted based on loading history (Poussen, Van Hoeke,
and Goubel 1990) and is particularly responsive to eccentric loading and
repetitive plyometric actions. Ultimately, a stiffer musculotendinous system
allows for more efficient elastic energy contributions at high countermovement speeds, thereby enhancing force production during the subsequent
concentric phase of the movement (Chelly and Denis 2001).
The term reactive strength combines the concepts of energy storage and
subsequent muscle action performance. Integral to reactive strength, the
stretch–shortening cycle (SSC) enhances the capacity of the muscle–tendon
unit to produce maximal force in the shortest amount of time (Chmielewski
et al. 2006). The rapid loading of muscle during the eccentric, or yielding,
phase of muscle action stimulates not only the storage of elastic energy, but
also a myostatic stretch reflex, through stimulation of mechanoreceptors
(i.e., muscle spindles). Afferent information is sent from the muscle spindles
through the monosynaptic reflex loop to provide excitatory feedback to the
preloaded (agonist) muscle. Both the rate of loading and the magnitude of
the respective load directly influence this reflex and the stimulation of the
agonist muscle (Bobbert et al. 1996).
Whereas SSC activity is considered more efficient (i.e., metabolic efficiency) than non-SSC activity (Alexander 2000), it is important to also
regard the influence of SSC on peak power output capacities, as it is
expressed through plyometric activity (e.g., jumping). The ability to discriminate concentric-only power output (i.e., without SSC) from that which
occurs during SSC actions is particularly important among athletes who
rely heavily on both attributes.

Sport Performance and Power
Proper assessment of power is vital for translation into sport performance
programming and exercise prescription. Following are several additional
points related to the application of power data for training and performance.

227


228

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Use of data to prescribe power training. Various researchers have suggested
training be prescribed at a load that accommodates maximal power output
(Kaneko et al. 1983). Using this strategy would thus require the acquisition of peak power data from a load–power curve for specific exercises.
Conversely, other experts have pointed out that because maximal power is
merely a snapshot of the instantaneous product of force and speed, training for improvement in power should instead be structured to address the
load–power continuum, and hence a broader range of factors that influence
the expression of power (i.e., maximal strength, strength-speed, speed,
RFD, and reactive strength). As a simple example of how the expression of
power may conceal the interaction between force production and movement speed, consider a situation in which power output is identical for two
loads, although the movement velocity is higher for the lighter load and
lower for the heavier load (Baker, Nance, and Moore 2001).
■■
Influence of body mass. Although significant debate currently surrounds
the appropriate use of power data for exercise prescription (Cronin and
Sleivert 2005; Cormie and Flanagan 2008), most experts agree that body
mass is a critical variable that should be accounted for, both when testing
and training for lower extremity muscular power. Because performance in
most sports requires a certain degree of proficiency in manipulating body
mass (e.g., jumping, bounding, accelerating, change of direction), it is certainly logical to control for the influence of body mass when evaluating
explosive movement. It is also vital to account for changes in body mass over
time, which facilitates accurate observations of power-to-body-mass-ratio
fluctuations. Power-to-body-mass ratio is considered a critical predictor of
performance enhancement across both anaerobic- and aerobic-based sports
(Gibala et al. 2006; Lunn, Finn, and Axtell 2009), and should therefore be
closely monitored (see the section Practical Applications for a case study
of the vertical jump).
■■
Hierarchy of performance. Modeling of athletic performance involves
a systematic, qualitative examination of movement to determine which
factors most contribute to diminished or enhanced performance (Bartlett
2007; Ham, Knez, and Young 2007). Also known as hierarchical models,
this process allows for the decomposition of movement into the contributory biomechanical and physiological factors that explain variability in the
performance outcome. At present much debate surrounds the strategies
to optimize power output and performance enhancement; and thus, more
research is needed to unravel the biomechanical and physiological issues
that explain the interrelationships among muscular strength, rate of force
development, maximal power output, and the subsequent translation of
these to explosive movement. For now, fitness professionals should consider
the expression of power within such a hierarchical construct and incorporate
a spectrum of sport-specific power tests. Assessing these factors separately
ensures a systematic prescription and refinement of training to maximize
performance.

Tests for Power
The remainder of this chapter presents several tests for evaluating power
and explosiveness that may be easily integrated into a sport conditioning or
personal training program. These tests have documented validity and reliability and may be applied according to the specific needs of an athlete. As
previously mentioned, a measure of power is specific to the context in which
it is executed (e.g., the time course for power production, muscle action
specificity), and thus should not be used interchangeably with other tests.

Lower Body Tests
The vast majority of research pertaining to power testing and training has
been devoted to the lower extremities. This is intuitive considering the
extent that muscles of the lower extremities are needed for producing the
ground reactive forces associated with acceleration, deceleration, jumping,
landing, and rapid changes of direction.

Wingate Anaerobic Test
Developed at the Wingate Institute in the 1970s (Ayalon, Inbar, and Bar-Or
1974), the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) measures peak anaerobic power,
anaerobic capacity, and anaerobic fatigue. This test occurs with a 30-second
time course using a cycle ergometer. The calculation of peak power is typically acquired within the first five seconds of work, and is expressed in
total watts (W), or relative to body mass (W/kg). Further, using the entire
30 seconds of cycling, anaerobic capacity (AC) may be calculated as the
total external work performed, and is expressed in kilojoules (kJ). Lastly,
anaerobic fatigue is often included in the WAnT and allows for the calculation of the percentage of power output reduction throughout the test (i.e.,
fatigue index).
Equipment
Mechanically braked cycle ergometer. For the WAnT, a Monark cycle
ergometer is typically used. Other ergometers (e.g., Fleisch cycle
ergometer) require different loading parameters.

test. At the end of each minute of the warm-up, the subject performs
approximately five seconds of sprinting.
Following the specific warm-up, the subject participates in light
dynamic stretching of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles.
This time may also be used to further explain testing instructions.
The test is initiated with the subject pedaling at maximal cadence
against no load. A verbal command of “Go” provides the auditory
cue to begin pedaling. Once the subject is at maximal cadence (usually in the first one to three seconds), apply the external load for the
30-second all-out test. Load = 0.075 kilogram per kilogram of body
mass (Monark cycle ergometer).
Following the application of the appropriate resistance, the 30-second
test is started, and data collection commences. The subject must remain
seated throughout the entire 30 seconds.
Flywheel revolutions per minute (rpm) are counted (preferably by
photocell and computer interface), and peak power is calculated based
on maximal rpm (usually over the first five seconds of work) and
angular distance. For the Monark cycle ergometer, each revolution is
equal to 1.615 meters.
The test is terminated after 30 seconds of all-out work. Following the
test, a two- to five-minute cool-down period is recommended before
the subject dismounts the cycle ergometer.

Outcome Measures
1. Peak power (PP) = (flywheel rpm for highest five-second period × 1.615
meters) × (resistance in kilograms × 9.8)
2. Mean power (MP) is calculated as the average of all five-second intervals throughout the entire 30-second test, and is usually regarded as
a surrogate descriptor of anaerobic endurance.
3. Anaerobic capacity (AC) is expressed as kilogram-Joules (1 kg-m =
9.804 J) and is calculated by adding each five-second peak power
output over the entire 30 seconds.
4. Anaerobic fatigue describes a decline in power output and is calculated
as follows: AF = [(highest five-second PP – lowest five-second PP) /
(highest five-second PP)] × 100.
5. The fatigue index is also often calculated to characterize the percentage of peak power drop-off: FI = [1 – (lowest power output / peak
power) × 100].
Additional Considerations and Modifications
A more thorough description of this test may be found in the seminal
text by Inbar and colleagues (Inbar, Bar-Or, and Skinner 1996). This test


Power

may be modified extensively,
depending on the desired
outcome. For example, if a
person is interested in merely
ascertaining peak power
output, there is no need to
perform the entire 30-second
test. A 5- to 10-second test
has been used for this purpose. Further, a modified
WAnT has been proposed
for elderly men and women
(Bar-Or 1992), in which
maximal pedaling occurs
for only 15 seconds. However, for this test, resistance
added to the flywheel is
equal to 9.5% of wholebody lean mass, which must
be ascertained through a
valid measurement of body
composition (e.g., wholebody plethysmography or
hydrodensitometry).

Margaria-Kalamen Test
Margaria, Aghemo, and Rovelli (1966) and Kalamen (1968) devised stair
sprinting tests to predict power output. What is commonly used today is
representative of the most reliable of the versions and is known as the
Margaria-Kalamen Power Test (Fox, Bowers, and Foss 1993; McArdle,
Katch, and Katch 2007). This test allows for a simple computation of power
output based on vertical distance traveled, total time to complete, and body
mass, following a rapid accent of a staircase. This test has been used with
various populations and provides a valid measure of peak power that has
been demonstrated to be positively associated with performance in other
explosive movements.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Equipment
Staircase with nine or more steps. The step should be approximately
7 inches (18 cm) high, and the lead-up area should be at least 20 feet
(6 m) long (see figure 9.3).
■■ Scale for body weight measurement
■■ Measuring stick or tape
■■ Electronic timer with a start and stop switch. A stopwatch may be used,
but this may not yield accurate time or power output calculations.
■■

Procedure
1. The height of each step is measured with a measuring stick or tape,
and recorded. The vertical distance from the third step to the ninth
step is then determined by multiplying the step height by six steps
(i.e., Step height × 6) (see figure 9.4 on p. 235). Height is recorded in
meters using this conversion factor: 1 inch = 0.0254 meters.

2. The timing switch mechanisms are placed on the third step and the
ninth step. These will allow for an accurate start time (third step) and
stop time (ninth step), respectively.
3. The subject’s weight is then taken and converted into newtons.
Conversion factors: 1 pound = 4.45 newtons; or 1 kilogram = 9.807
newtons.
4. Warm-up: After initial familiarization with the test procedure, the
subject performs approximately five minutes of moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise (incline walking or jogging are preferable), followed
by several dynamic range of motion exercises for the hip flexors and
extensors, hamstrings, quadriceps, and calves. The subject is then
allowed two trial runs at approximately 50 and 80% to fully acclimate
to the test procedures. This will allow for the most valid measure of
maximal power production.
5. The test is initiated with the subject sprinting forward across the leadup area (see figure 9.4) toward the staircase. A verbal command of
“Go” provides the auditory cue to begin sprinting from the starting
line.
6. The subject ascends the flight of stairs as quickly as possible, taking
three steps at a time (i.e., from the floor to the third step, sixth step,
and ninth step).
7. Time is recorded from the third step to the ninth step, to the nearest
0.01 seconds, using the timing system or stopwatch.
8. The test should be repeated once or twice to determine the best possible performance. Recovery between trials should be two to three
minutes.

Outcome Measures
Power in watts (W) is calculated using the subject’s weight (in newtons),
total vertical distance (in meters), and time (in seconds) by the following
formula:
Power (watts) = (weight × height) / time
Table 9.4 provides normative values for the Margaria-Kalamen test.
Additional Considerations and Modifications
A thorough description of the age-based norms for this test exist (McArdle,
Katch, and Katch 2007). In addition, several modifications to the MargariaKalamen test have been devised to accommodate certain populations.
Because some people cannot safely ascend a staircase by every third step,
Clemons and Harrison (2008) devised a modification that requires subjects
to ascend a single flight of 11 steps. This modification does not require a
sprint lead-up, and so a normal staircase can be used. For the ascent, participants take a single step initially (i.e., onto the first step), followed by
two steps each stride thereafter. A vertical distance of 2.04 meters is used
for the measurement of power, and time in seconds is recorded to ascend
to the top of the staircase (see figure 9.4). Time is recorded from the top of
step 1 to the top of step 11, and power is calculated as Power (W) = [(body
mass (kg) × 2.04) × 9.81) / time].

Vertical Jump Test

The vertical jump (VJ) is one of the most frequently used tests of power
and explosiveness in strength and conditioning. The appeal of the VJ test
is due, in part, to the ease of test administration, but also to the fact that
the results are directly applicable to most sports that require jumping and
others in which lower body power output is paramount (e.g., weightlifting). As previously mentioned, numerous underlying factors contribute to
VJ performance, and as such, numerous methods of testing jumping ability
exist. Some of the most common versions of VJ testing are the basic countermovement VJ, the squat jump, and the approach VJ. The procedures for a
standard countermovement vertical jump are provided next, and additional
information concerning modifications is presented at the end.
Equipment
Commercially available Vertec apparatus (Sports Imports, Columbus,
OH) (see figure 9.5)
Or
■■ A smooth, tall wall (i.e., with ceiling height greater than the subject’s
jumping ability)
■■ Chalk to mark hand
■■ Measuring stick or tape
■■

Procedure Using Vertec Apparatus
1. The subject’s weight is taken and converted into kilograms (for purposes of peak power estimate). Conversion factor: 1 pound = 0.454
kilograms.

235


236

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

2. The subject’s reach height is measured and recorded. To do this, adjust
the height of the Vertec plastic vanes to be within the subject’s reach.
The shaft that holds the vanes is marked with measurements, and the
measurement selected should coincide with the bottom vane. Each
vane represents 0.5 inches, and each red vane represents an increment of 6 inches. The subject reaches, without lifting the heels (i.e.,
flat footed) and touches the highest vane possible with the dominant
hand. To prevent confounding results, the subject must stand directly
beneath the apparatus and reach as high as possible.
3. Warm-up: After initial familiarization with the test procedure and the
Vertec apparatus, the subject performs approximately five minutes of
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (incline walking or jogging are
preferable), followed by several dynamic range of motion exercises
for the hip flexors and extensors, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves,
and shoulders. The subject is then allowed several trials without the
Vertec apparatus to become familiar with the countermovement jump
procedure.
4. The subject’s jump height is then measured and recorded. To do this,
lift the height of the Vertec stack so that the top vane is higher than
the subject’s estimated jump height. Again, the measurement on the
Vertec shaft must be carefully used to ensure an accurate calculation
of jump height.

5. For a standard countermovement VJ test, the subject is not permitted
to take any lead-up steps (i.e., approach). This test requires the subject to perform a rapid countermovement by quickly descending into
a squat (i.e., flexion of hips and knees, and forward and downward
movement of the trunk) while swinging the arms down and backward
(see figure 9.5). This rapid countermovement is immediately followed
by a maximal jump in which the dominant hand reaches to touch the
highest possible Vertec vane.
6. Following each jump, the vanes are moved out of the way for consecutive trials (i.e., the highest vane touched and all vanes underneath
are turned to the opposite direction).
7. The best of three trials is recorded to the nearest 0.5 inch.
8. Vertical jump height is recorded as the difference between the highest
jump and the previously recorded reach height.
Procedure Using Wall and Chalk
General note: The measurement of body weight and procedures for warm-up
and countermovement are the same as those used when testing VJ with
the Vertec apparatus.
1. The subject’s reach height is measured and recorded. To do this, the
subject rubs chalk on the middle finger of the dominant hand. Standing
with the dominant shoulder adjacent to the wall, the subject reaches
as high as possible and makes a chalk mark on the wall.
2. Using a countermovement, the subject then jumps as high as possible
and makes a second chalk mark on the wall to designate the height
of the maximal jump.
3. The best of three trials is recorded to the nearest 0.5 inch.
4. Vertical jump height is recorded as the difference between the highest
chalk mark and the previously recorded reach height.
Outcome Measures
1. Vertical jump performance = maximal jump height – reach height.
Normative data on VJ performance are provided for nonathletic,
healthy college students (Patterson and Peterson 2004) as well as for
various athletic populations (Hoffman 2006).
2. Estimate of power: Several equations allow for the estimation of
power from vertical jump performance. This is an important step
to consider, because body mass is associated with jump height and
instantaneous power production. For example, if two people have the
same absolute vertical jump, but different body masses, they perform
different quantities of work to achieve that jump height. Further, this
may also apply to repeated bouts of testing for the same person over

237


238

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

an extended period of time. If a person gains or loses weight between
bouts of testing, jump height and subsequent power production may
be altered. Jump height is therefore a crude proxy for explosive power
performance. One frequently used equation is the Sayers equation
(1999), which estimates peak power as follows:
Peak power (W) = [60.7 × (jump height [cm]) + 45.3 ×
(body mass [kg]) – 2,055]
This equation has been shown to be highly valid and reliable, and gender
differences do not interfere with the accuracy of PP estimates (Sayers et al.
1999). Further, this method has been verified as a valuable means of quan-

tifying lower body PP and weightlifting ability among elite athletes (Carlock
et al. 2004). Harman and colleagues (1991) developed another commonly
used equation that allows for an estimate of both peak and mean power,
with the following computations:
Peak power (W) = [61.9 × (jump height [cm]) + 36 ×
(body mass [kg]) + 1,822]
Mean power (W) = [21.2 × (jump height [cm]) + 23 ×
(body mass [kg]) –1,393]
There are no normative data across multiple populations using these
equations. Therefore, they should be used to estimate power output within
subjects (clients or athletes) to enhance internal validity, rather than to make
comparative inferences to a norm-reference standard. Tables 9.5, 9.6, and
9.7 provide percentile ranks for the vertical jump test.
Additional Considerations and Modifications
A static squat jump (SJ) test may be used as a modification of the countermovement VJ test. This test requires the same basic procedures as the VJ
test, except that the countermovement is removed. The subject descends
into a full squat position (i.e., thighs approximately parallel to the floor, or
knees at a 90° angle), where a one- to two-second isometric contraction
occurs. Following a “Go” command, the subject jumps as high as possible,
without a countermovement. Depending on the procedure, some experts
do not recommend using an arm action when performing the SJ (e.g.,
hands are on hips or fingers are interlaced behind the head). Specifically,
if a contact mat or force platform is used then an arm action may not be

239


240

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

advisable, because doing so artificially augments jump performance and
confounds the measurement accuracy of lower body power production.
The SJ is an effective test for evaluating concentric-only explosive movement, and many strength and conditioning coaches use it as a supplement
to the traditional VJ. The Sayers equation may also be used for this test,
because it has been demonstrated to be valid and reliable (Sayers et al.
1999). Some coaches prefer to have subjects start by sitting down in a chair
when testing SJ, to prevent a countermovement from occurring. This can
be dangerous, however, because the chair may interfere with a safe landing.
An approach VJ allows the subject to take several lead-up steps prior to a
maximal countermovement jump. Many strength and conditioning coaches
use an approach VJ, because it is representative of sport-specific explosive
movement. Variations of this test exist (e.g., single-leg take-off versus
double-leg take-off; one-step approach versus multiple-step approach);
however, to collect reliable data, fitness professionals should adopt a single
procedure and replicate it over multiple repeated bouts (i.e., between subjects, as well as for multiple trials for a single subject).

Reactive Strength Index (RSI)
Reactive strength performance may account for the stretch–shortening
cycle (SSC) that occurs during explosive movement in many performance
tasks. Specifically, in movements that involve high force and high-speed
muscle and joint actions (e.g., the vertical jump), the force–velocity curve is
affected by the preceding loading phase (i.e., countermovement) such that
at any given speed of movement, a greater force production is possible (i.e.,
the force–velocity curve shifts to the right). Because of the neuromuscular
adaptation and alteration in musculotendinous stiffness that occurs in conjunction with plyometric and eccentric exercise (Poussen, Van Hoeke, and
Goubel 1990), this parameter is considered to be a trainable entity, thus
requiring a valid, reliable system to assess it.
Although various approaches have been used, most are performed to
compare the countermovement jump and the static squat jump heights
(Walshe, Wilson, and Murphy 1996). A slightly different approach, the
reactive strength index (RSI), has recently been used to quantify plyometric or SSC performance (Flanagan and Harrison 2007); it is derived from
performance in the depth jump. RSI calculation uses jump performance
and time spent on the ground (i.e., the amortization phase is the time spent
to decelerate from the landing in which muscle lengthening occurs, to the
time of take-off in a subsequent maximal jump), and has demonstrated to
be a valid and reliable means of expressing explosiveness (Flanagan, Ebben,
and Jensen 2008).


Power

Equipment
Various plyometric boxes or risers of different heights. This test has
documented validity and reliability at a box height of 30 centimeters
(11.8 in.) (Flanagan, Ebben, and Jensen 2008).
■■ Commercially available contact mat
■■

Procedure
1. Warm-up: After initial familiarization with the test procedure and
the contact mat, the subject performs approximately five minutes of
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (jogging or running is preferable),
followed by several dynamic and rapid range of motion exercises for
the hip flexors and extensors, hamstrings, quadriceps, and calves.
The subject is then allowed several depth jump trials at a submaximal
effort. Because this test is stressful to the muscles and joints of the
lower body, fully acclimating subjects to this test is very important.
2. To initiate this test, the subject steps off the box and lands with both
feet on the contact mat simultaneously. Immediately following this
landing, the subject jumps as high as possible. Particular emphasis
should be made to reduce eccentric action and contact time from the
depth jump prior to the concentric action.
3. The subject should perform two or three trials at each box height,
with a minimum of 90 seconds of recovery between trials.
Outcome Measures
1. The subject’s jump height and contact time are measured and recorded
from the contact mat. Using the flight time, jump height is calculated
using the following equation: Jump height = (9.81 × flight time2) / 8.
2. Ground contact time may be calculated as the time between initial
foot contact and take-off (Flanagan, Ebben, and Jensen 2008).
3. Reactive strength index (RSI) is calculated using the following equation: RSI = jump height / contact time.
Additional Considerations and Modifications
Other methods allow fitness professionals to examine the effects of the SSC
and its relation to explosive movement or athletic performance. An alternative to the RSI test involves comparing the eccentric utilization ratio (EUR)
by simply examining the ratio of countermovement jump height to squat
jump height (McGuigan et al. 2006). Using these two factors, prestretch
augmentation can be calculated as follows:
(Countermovement jump height – squat jump height) / squat jump
height) × 100
Each of these measures may provide reliable data to account for changes in
SSC and musculotendinous stiffness that occurs with training.

Standing Long Jump
The standing long jump (SLJ) is another frequently used test of lower
body explosive performance. This test may be used in conjunction with
the VJ test, because it provides information about vertical and horizontal
displacement. This test is particularly important to administer when SLJ
exercises (e.g., bounding) are included in athletes’ exercise prescriptions.
Data on maximal SLJ distance help fitness professionals prescribe specific
percentages of this performance for subsequent training dosages (e.g., three
repetitions at 90% SLJ max).
Equipment
Flat jumping surface, at least 20 feet (6 meters) long. Gym floors (i.e.,
basketball or volleyball courts), rubber tracks, and artificial turf field
are recommended.
■■ Tape measure
■■ Roll of masking tape
■■ Several commercially available standing long jump mats (e.g., Gill
Athletics, Champaign, IL) may be used for this test.
■■

Procedure
1. Designate a starting line. This may be done using a 3-foot (1 m) piece
of masking tape.
2. Warm-up: After initial familiarization with the SLJ test procedure, the
subject performs approximately five minutes of moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise (jogging or running is preferable), followed by several
dynamic and rapid range of motion exercises for the hip flexors and
extensors, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and shoulders. The subject
is then allowed several SLJ trials at less-than-maximal effort. Like the
RSI test, this test is stressful to the muscles and joints of the lower
body, which makes fully acclimating subjects to this test exceedingly
important.
3. The subject’s jump distance is measured and recorded. With the toes
behind the starting line, the subject uses a rapid countermovement
and then jumps forward as far as possible. A marker is placed behind
the subject’s rearmost heel, using a small piece of masking tape.
4. The best of three trials is recorded to the nearest 0.5 inch.
5. Standing long jump performance is recorded as the difference from
the starting line (i.e., the 0-inch mark) and the longest jump.
Outcome Measures
Standing long jump = maximal jump distance from the 0-inch mark / starting line. Table 9.8 shows percentile and ranking data for elite and 15- and
16-year-old male and female athletes (Chu 1996).

Additional Considerations
Because this test has an increased risk for injury, it should be reserved for
well-trained people with no existing injuries or musculoskeletal discomfort.
As mentioned, it is exceedingly important that subjects warm up properly
prior to this test. Further, several preliminary trials are typically needed to
serve as a specific warm-up.

Upper Body Tests
The majority of tests and training protocols emphasize lower extremity
muscular power. However, upper extremity power production and performance are also exceedingly important for most sports and activities. Two
primary tests to examine maximal upper extremity anaerobic capacity and
power are the Upper Body Wingate Anaerobic Test and the Medicine Ball
Put. Each of these tests has been validated numerous times and has proven
reliable across multiple populations.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Upper Body Wingate Anaerobic Test
Similar to the traditional WAnT for the lower body, the Upper Body Wingate
Anaerobic Test is generally performed in a laboratory setting and has the
advantage of providing several outcomes related to upper body anaerobic
capacity. This test occurs with a 30-second time course using a modified cycle
ergometer with an arm crank. The calculation of peak power is typically
acquired within the first three to five seconds of work, and is expressed in
total watts (W), or relative to body mass (W/kg). Further, using the entire
30 seconds of arm cranking, anaerobic capacity (AC) may be calculated
as the total external work performed, and is expressed in kilojoules (kJ).
Lastly, anaerobic fatigue is often reported, which allows for the calculation of the percentage of power output reduction throughout the test (i.e.,
fatigue index).
Equipment
Mechanically braked cycle ergometer with additional adjustment for
an arm crank (i.e., a cycle ergometer with handles where the pedals
normally are)
■■ Table for mounting the ergometer for testing. This should be higher
than 70 centimeters (27.6 in.) and have room for legs underneath.
■■ Additional weight (80 to 100 kg, or 176 to 220 lb) to load the ergometer to prevent movement during the test
■■ Optical sensor to detect and count reflective markers on the flywheel
■■ Computer and interface with appropriate software (e.g., Sports Medicine Industries, Inc.)
■■

Procedure
1. The subject should be seated comfortably in a chair placed behind the
cycle ergometer so that the feet are flat on the floor. This allows the
subject to pedal with no restrictions.
2. Warm-up: After initial familiarization with and individual adjustment of the upper body ergometer, the subject performs three to five
minutes of light arm cranking, with no load or a load that is less than
20% of the load used for the actual test. At the end of each minute of
the warm-up, the subject should perform approximately five seconds
of maximal arm cranking.
3. Following the specific warm-up, the subject should participate in light
dynamic stretching of the entire shoulder joint, pectoral musculature,
and muscles of the biceps, triceps, and forearms. This time may also
be used to further explain testing instructions.
4. The test is initiated with the subject cranking at maximal cadence
against no load. A verbal command of “Go” provides the auditory cue


Power

to begin arm cranking. Once the subject is at maximal cadence (usually in the first one to three seconds), apply the external load for the
30-second all-out test. Load = 0.050 kilogram per kilogram of body
mass (Monark cycle ergometer) (Nindl et al. 1995).
5. Following the application of the appropriate resistance, the 30-second
test is started, and data collection commences. The subject must remain
seated throughout the entire 30 seconds.
6. Flywheel revolutions per minute (rpm) are counted (preferably by
photocell and computer interface), and peak power is calculated based
on maximal rpm (usually over the first five seconds of work) and
angular distance. Each revolution is equal to 1.615 meters.
7. The test is terminated after 30 seconds of all-out work. Following the
test, a two- to five-minute cool-down period is recommended.
Outcome Measures
See the section Wingate Anaerobic Test. Table 9.9 provides typical values
for peak mean power in males and females for the Upper Body Wingate
Anaerobic Test.

Medicine Ball Put
The field test most frequently used to measure power of the upper body is
the seated medicine ball put (Clemons, Campbell, and Jeansonne 2010). The
widespread popularity of this test is due not only to the ease of administration, but also to the direct specificity of this movement to a functional task
such as the chest pass in basketball, or even the rapid punching of combat
athletes. Moreover, because this exercise is commonly used in training, test
data may easily be extrapolated to training prescription.
Equipment
45° incline bench
■■ High-durability medicine ball: 6 kilograms (13.2 lb) for females, 9 kilograms (19.8 lb) for males (Clemons, Campbell, and Jeansonne 2010)
■■ Gymnastics chalk (i.e., carbonate of magnesium)
■■ Measuring tape
■■ Room or gymnasium with at least 8 meters (26 feet) of clearance
■■

Procedure
1. The measuring tape is placed on the floor with the end positioned
under the front frame of the bench, to anchor it.
2. The tip of the tape should be positioned so it is aligned with the outside of the medicine ball while it rests on the subject’s chest (i.e., in

the ready position, prior to putting the ball) (Clemons, Campbell, and
Jeansonne 2010; see figure 9.6).
The tape should be extended outward from the bench for at least 8
meters (26 feet), and secured to the floor.
Warm-up: After initial familiarization with the bench orientation and
putting procedure, the subject performs five minutes of moderateintensity aerobic exercise, followed by several dynamic range of
motion exercises for the shoulder and elbow joint (e.g., modified or
regular push-ups or hand walk-outs). The subject is then allowed
several submaximal trials with the appropriate medicine ball.
For the test, the subject should be seated comfortably on the incline
bench with feet flat on the floor and the medicine ball against the
chest.
The subject grasps the medicine ball with both hands, one on each
side.
Without any additional bodily movement (e.g., trunk or neck flexion,
arm countermovement), the subject attempts to propel (i.e., “put”) the
medicine ball at an optimal trajectory of 45°, for maximal horizontal
distance.
Every attempt should be made to propel the ball in a straight line, to
yield valid data.
Three to five attempts are permitted, with a minimum of two minutes
of rest between attempts.

Outcome Measures
Each test attempt should be measured by the closest chalk mark (i.e., in
the direction of the bench) and recorded to the nearest centimeter or inch.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Modifications
This test has been used extensively with various loading parameters and
across populations. Further, many studies have reported the use of upright
benches (i.e., seated upright at 90°) instead of 45° incline benches. To
maintain test quality, examiners should use the same protocol each time a
given subject is tested.

Warm-Up and Postactivation Potentiation (PAP):
A Special Consideration for Testing Power
When designing an exercise prescription for improved muscular performance, the prescription of independent exercises and variables must account
for both acute physiologic responses (i.e., immediate response), as well
as the chronic adaptive response to training. Likewise, when designing a
test battery to evaluate baseline performance and enhancement, the acute
responses of warm-ups, testing procedures, and testing sequences should
be considered, as these factors may strongly influence test outcomes.
According to the Fitness-Fatigue Model (Bannister 1991; Chiu and Barnes
2003), the stressors that manifest in a testing or training session produce
distinct physiological responses that affect immediate performance, as well
as chronic adaptive-responses. Essentially, the model is based on two tenets:
an enhanced fitness after-effect and a suppressed fatigue after-effect. Relative to this chapter, the first tenet is specific to the immediate, heightened
physiological response as elicited by acute stimuli (i.e., through strategic
warm-up procedures). If applied appropriately, this acute stimulus may have
a direct influence on the power production capacity of the neuromuscular
system, particularly in tests of instantaneous maximal power.
Most research on this topic has examined the effect of electrically stimulated muscle fiber and the consequent “potentiated” effect on muscle twitch
and force production, in animal models. Interestingly, a considerable amount
of recent evidence in humans demonstrates an immediate enhancement of
force production following voluntary muscle action at high relative loads
(Baudry and Duchateau 2007). The mechanisms for this time-dependent
increase in performance are largely unexplained, but have been attributed
to an increased rate of cross-bridge attachment as a result of an enhanced
sensitivity of the contractile proteins to calcium (Ca2+) (Baudry and Duchateau 2007). This acute response elicits improvement in performance through
increases in twitch force and rate of force development. From a practical
standpoint, postactivation potentiation (PAP) following highly intense
stimuli has also been found to increase the rate of force development, jump
height, and sprint performance (Chiu and Barnes 2003; Chatzopoulos et
al. 2007).


Power

249

Clearly, the application of PAP through strategic warm-up approaches
may offer a neurological advantage in acute competitive or testing scenarios.
Progressive dynamic warm-up protocols should incorporate successive
movements ranging from low intensity to high intensity, to adequately
prepare the body to produce maximal power.
The effects of PAP are not uniform across all athletes. A given stimuli
that is appropriate for one athlete may actually induce fatigue in another.
Therefore, it is important to offer a variety of progressive warm-ups to
accommodate people at different levels of training and degrees of muscular
fitness.

(continued)

Professional Applications

Power is expressed across virtually all dynamic muscle actions and shares a
robust association with movement on a continuum from basic activities of daily
life to high-level performance. The measurement of power output accounts for
neuromuscular subtleties that are not captured when examining raw strength
capacity or speed of movement. Thus, power may be a superior indicator of
coordinated movement, chronic functional capacity, or acute deficiency. A thorough comprehension of the factors that contribute to power production and
translation to explosive movement will provide a foundation for monitoring,
developing, and refining performance enhancement programming.
The assessment of power should be not only a principal element of any
athlete or client profile (i.e., during a needs analysis), but also as an index of
fitness or performance adaptation over time. Because the overt expression of
power involves numerous physiological factors, conducting a battery of tests to
capture the range of maximal capacities across various time-course intervals
(e.g., RFD, maximal instantaneous power, peak power over 5 to 10 seconds of
exertion, maximal and mean anaerobic power over 15 to 30 seconds) provides
an accurate picture of a person’s true strengths and weaknesses. Conversely,
by limiting power assessment to a single test, a fitness professional would
greatly reduce the likelihood of pinpointing underlying deficiencies. Such an
omission may occur because the expression of power is influenced by more than
a single factor, and can thus become convoluted either through changes in a
single factor, or any combination of multiple factors. By using a comprehensive
approach that accounts for the fundamental requirements of a given activity or
sport (i.e., energy-system, biomechanical, and muscle-action specificity), fitness
professionals can use strategic testing and targeted training to address clients’
deficiencies, maximize adaptations, and significantly improve their performance.
However, as is the case with other muscular fitness components, methods
of testing power are task specific, and vary considerably in biomechanical attributes and the time alloted for data collection. These tests should not be used
interchangeably, because the results do not always reflect the same outcomes


250

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments
(continued)

and thus may not be relevant to a given training agenda or sport-specific performance. Further, power exhibited under one set of conditions may not necessarily
translate across other conditions. Therefore, fitness professionals should isolate
and assess the specific “trainable” attributes that could prohibit or potentiate
power output adaptation. As outlined in this chapter, power should be evaluated
using a systems approach that incorporates multiple components related to
absolute force production, rate of force production, metabolic specificity, movement velocity, work capacity, and body-mass-adjusted power.
Because power is reflective of the interaction between muscle force and
velocity, anything that alters either of these two parameters also directly modifies power production capacity. However, because performance in most sports
requires a certain degree of proficiency in manipulating body mass (e.g., jumping,
bounding, accelerating, cutting), fitness professionals should also consider the
influence of body mass when evaluating explosive movement. Accounting for
changes in body mass over time may also allow for the accurate observation
of body-mass-adjusted power fluctuation.
Body-mass-adjusted power (a.k.a. power-to-weight ratio) has been suggested
as a fundamental predictor of performance in most sports. This is intuitive
considering that the load being manipulated in most activities is the mass of
the body; thus, performance can be improved by increasing power, decreasing
body mass, or doing a combination of both. Although weight loss, per se, is
not generally a goal in most performance enhancement programs, in certain
cases body fat reduction may be warranted. A person with excess body fat who
reduces absolute fat mass may experience augmented performance and realize
a positive adaptation for long-term cardiometabolic health.
The following case study demonstrates the contribution of body mass and
peak power to vertical jump performance. Although hypothetical, this is a
realistic example of how manipulating one or more variables can translate to
augmented performance in explosive movement. Such an example may also
serve as a paradigm for other explosive and nonexplosive efforts that require
manipulating body mass.
Athlete Profile
Sex: Male
Age: 18 years
Sport: Division I American football
Position: Linebacker
Body mass: 235 lbs (106.6 kg)
Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185.4 cm)
Body mass index: 31 kg ∙ m–2
Body composition: Body fat percentage: 18%; absolute body fat mass:
42.3 lb (19.2 kg)
Strength: 1RM squat: 365 lb (165.5 kg)
Vertical jump: 25 inches (63.5 cm)


Power

Using the Sayers equation, it is possible to estimate the peak power (PP) in
watts for this athlete.
Peak power (W) = [60.7 × (jump height [cm]) + 45.3 × (body mass [kg]) – 2,055]
PP = (60.7 × 63.5 cm) + (45.3 × 106.6 kg) – 2,055
PP = 3,854.5 + 4,828.9 – 2,055
PP = 6,628.4 watts

By algebraically rearranging the regression formula for PP, it is possible to set
jump height as the dependent variable. Using this strategy, PP and body mass
become independent variables, and the constants remain the same.
Jump height [cm] = [(2,055 + PP) – (45.3 × body mass [kg])] / 60.7

Based on this new equation, it is possible to predict jump height when a
change in body mass occurs. Therefore, if the athlete in this case study were to
maintain muscle power output capacity and lose 5% body fat (e.g. ~5% loss of
body fat = 11.75 lb [5.3 kg]), he would weigh 223.3 lb (101.3 kg). By entering
this new value into the model, it is possible to predict change in jump height
with the following equation:
∆ jump height = [(((2,055 + 6,628.4) – (45.3 × post body mass [kg])) / 60.7)) –
(((2,055 + 6,628.4) – (45.3 × pre body mass [kg])) / 60.7)]
∆ jump height = [(((2,055 + 6,628.4) – (45.3 × 101.3 kg)) / 60.7)) –
(((2,055 + 6,628.4) – (45.3 × 106.6 kg)) / 60.7)]
∆ jump height = (67.5 cm – 63.5 cm)
∆ jump height = 4 cm (1.58 in)

It is also plausible to speculate on how changes in PP may influence jump
height, independent of changes in body mass. Although the original regression
equation was formulated using force plate analyses of vertical ground reaction
force during the squat jump and countermovement vertical jump (Sayers 1999),
ample evidence confirms the utility of both high-intensity strength training and
high-speed power training to improve PP during jumping (Cormie, McCaulley,
and McBride 2007; Cormie, McGuigan, and Newton 2011b). Therefore, by using
this logic, several viable options exist to alter power and jump height:
Viable Performance Enhancement Options
Strength increase only. Method: High-intensity strength training
Speed increase only. Method: High-speed plyometric and power training
Body mass decrease only. Method: Closely monitored and gradual decreases
in absolute body fat

Strength increase + speed increase. Method: Combined multimodality,
traditional periodized training, or both
Strength increase + body mass decrease
Speed increase + body mass decrease
Strength increase + speed increase + body mass decrease
This simplistic example demonstrates the fact that many choices are available for achieving the desired outcome of increased VJ performance. Because
most performance enhancement programs are not designed to elicit changes in
absolute fat mass (on the contrary, relative decreases in fat mass are expected
when hypertrophy occurs), fitness professionals should instead regard the
trainable muscular fitness parameters as the priority. Clearly, other variables
such as RFD and reactive strength capacity may also influence VJ performance.
Moreover, the influence of these factors on VJ is likely not uniform across populations (i.e., sex, age, training status). However, this example is intended merely
to serve as a discussion point for emphasizing the multidimensional nature of
power and explosive movement performance. Ultimately, using a comprehensive approach to evaluate these attributes will provide ample opportunity to
optimize performance.

Muscular power is robustly associated with movement on a continuum that spans performance at all levels.
The measurement of power output accounts for neuromuscular and
energy transfer properties that are often overlooked with other raw
measures of strength or speed.
Power output is an excellent indicator of coordinated movement
capacity, deficiency, or both, and its expression is contingent on
numerous interrelated physiological attributes and biomechanical
aspects.
Evaluation of power output in the professional setting requires a
broad-based, systematic examination of the requirements of the
population being tested.
Although numerous tests exist to measure muscular power production, each is specific to the context in which it is implemented.
A thorough needs analysis should precede any performance testing
and should account for the requisite underlying physiological, biomechanical, and external factors that go into the specific available
tests, as well as an evaluation of how well these tests coincide with
the needs of a given athlete.
Body mass should be taken into consideration to gauge power-toweight ratio.
