Mobility
Sean P. Flanagan, PhD, ATC, CSCS

Mobility, or ease of movement, is a fundamental requisite of human movement. A certain minimal amount of mobility is necessary for accomplishing
any task, be it an activity of daily living or a sport. Mobility is determined
by the composite motion available at all of the joints involved in the movement, known as a kinematic chain.1 Too much (hypermobility) or too little
(hypomobility) mobility can have negative consequences for performance
and increase the potential for injury. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of joint motion should be part of any assessment of a personal training
client or athlete.
This chapter examines some of the fundamental concepts associated with
mobility and the effects of hyper- and hypomobility on performance and
injury potential. Finally, methods used to measure it and how to interpret
the results are examined.
Before beginning the discussion, we need to distinguish between mobility and flexibility, and address the current controversy of, and misconceptions about, static stretching. Mobility is the amount of motion available at
a joint (or series of joints) and the ease with which the joint(s) can move
through the range of motion (ROM). Flexibility refers to the extensibility of
the periarticular structures (i.e., muscle, tendon, and fascia) and is but one
of the factors that can limit ROM and impede mobility. A growing body of
literature (Haff et al. 2006) suggests that static stretching may not improve

Most people realize that the body acts like a chain of rigid body segments that are attached to each other
and operate together. In engineering, such a system is called a kinematic chain because it describes the
motions of these segments without regard for the forces that cause those motions. In exercise science,
the term kinetic chain is often used interchangeably with kinematic chain, even though the term kinetic
chain does not exist in engineering. Kinetics refers to the forces that cause motion. While there is utility
in examining how forces are transferred throughout the chain, when discussing mobility the more correct
term kinematic chain should be used.

performance or decrease injury. Several studies have also shown that static
stretching may actually decrease peak force, rate of force development, and
power output (Stone et al. 2006) for up to an hour after stretching.
Although findings seem to suggest that there is no need to improve flexibility (or mobility), two important points need to be addressed. First, the
acute effects of stretching have to be separated from the chronic effects of
stretching (Stone et al. 2006). Just because the acute effects of static stretching appear to have no benefit in terms of injury reduction and may have
detrimental effects on performance, this does not mean that static stretching
cannot have beneficial effects over time. Second, most of the conclusions
about the chronic effects of stretching on injury and performance may be
based on a faulty premise (i.e., more is better). If a cake recipe calls for two
cups of sugar, adding only one cup will certainly degrade the quality of
cake, but adding four cups will not make for a better cake.
Each activity requires a certain amount of mobility for optimal performance. If the person performing that activity does not have an adequate
amount of mobility, decreased performance and increased potential for
injury could surely result. Even the most ardent proponents of flexibility
training seem to concede this point (Haff et al. 2006). Therefore, fitness
professionals must understand mobility, determine the mobility demands
of a sport or task, and assess the mobility of the athlete to ensure adequate
performance for that sport or task.

Fundamental Concepts of Mobility
Individual joint motion has two parts: osteokinematics and arthrokinematics
(Levangie and Norkin 2001). The rotation of the two bones in a plane about
a common axis is referred to as osteokinematics, whereas arthrokinematics refers to the relative motion (sliding, spinning, and rolling) that occurs
between the joint surfaces (see figure 11.1). Osteokinematics is the major
component of joint motion and is the focus of this chapter.
Range of motion (ROM) is the amount of rotation available at a joint, or
a measure of the osteokinematics. A joint has ROM in each plane of movement in which that joint can rotate, known as a degree of freedom (DOF).
If a joint has rotation available only in the sagittal plane, it will have only a
single DOF; a joint that allows triplanar motion will have three DOFs. For
each DOF, motion is available in two directions (e.g., flexion and extension
in the sagittal plane). The DOF of the entire kinematic chain is the sum of
the DOFs at each joint in the chain.
The number of DOFs and the amount of ROM in each DOF for each joint
are determined by several factors, including the following:

Extensibility of the periarticular structures
Number of joints involved in the movement

The shape of the articular surfaces will largely dictate the number of
DOFs (Levangie and Norkin 2001), and the cartilaginous and ligamentous
structures will guide the motion in that DOF. For example, the sutures of
the skull are joints with virtually no movement, whereas the synovial joints
of the limbs allow a relatively large amount of motion. Additionally, hinge
and pivot-type synovial joints (e.g., elbow and forearm, respectively) have
only one DOF, whereas ball and socket joints of the shoulder and hip have
three. Most other types of synovial joints have two DOFs. Understanding
the joint shape is important in knowing which motions to test and which
would be considered abnormal, so the examiner should have an appreciation for the type of joint that is being tested. The motions available at the
joints are presented in tables 11.1 and 11.2 for the extremities and spine,
respectively.
As mentioned earlier, arthrokinematic motion is small, accessory motion
that occurs at the joint surfaces, such as sliding and spinning (Levangie and
Norkin 2001). It influences the amount of osteokinematic motion available.
As one bone rotates relative to another (fixed) bone, a certain amount of

sliding is necessary for maintaining congruency between the articular surfaces; a restriction in the amount of sliding will limit the amount of rotation.
For example, extending the wrist requires the proximal carpal row to slide
toward the palm. A restriction of sliding in the palmar direction will limit
the amount of wrist extension.
Arthrokinematic motion is determined by the joint structures themselves:
the shape of the articular surfaces and cartilaginous and ligamentous structures. Excessive arthrokinematic motion is termed joint laxity, whereas
an abnormally low amount of motion is a joint restriction. Evaluation of
arthrokinematic motion is beyond the scope of this chapter; people suspected of having abnormal arthrokinematic motion should be referred to
the appropriate health care provider for further assessment and treatment,
if necessary.
The extensibility of the periarticular structures (e.g., muscle, tendon, fascia)
limits the amount of motion in a DOF. In the absence of joint pathology
(an assumption made throughout the rest of this chapter, unless otherwise
indicated), ROM is often considered a measure of the extensibility of those
periarticular structures. Extensibility of the periarticular structures is joint
specific. It is generally accepted that flexibility is not a general characteristic

of a person (Berryman Reese and Bandy 2002), but rather, is joint specific.
Therefore, no one test can determine how “flexible” a person is.
It is important to understand that the joints of the body rarely act in isolation. Rather, they act as part of a kinematic chain. When the distal end
of a limb is free to move (i.e., open kinematic chain), a muscle’s extensibility will affect the ROM of each joint it crosses in the direction opposite its
anatomical classification of action.
A monoarticular (single) muscle crosses one joint and affects the ROM
of that joint (e.g., the gluteus maximus crosses the hip joint and affects hip
flexion ROM). Multijoint muscles cross two (biarticular) or more (polyarticular) joints. A biarticular muscle affects both joints that it crosses (the
hamstring crosses both the hip and the knee and affects the ROM of hip
flexion and knee extension). Polyarticular muscles (such as the long head
of the biceps brachii) affect each joint they cross. When a muscle’s action
creates joint rotations in multiple planes, its extensibility affects the ROM of
each rotation in the opposite direction of its anatomical action. For example,


Mobility

the gluteus maximus both extends and externally rotates the hip joint.
Therefore, its extensibility affects both hip flexion and hip internal rotation.
When the distal end of a segment is fixed or constrained to move in some
way (i.e., closed kinematic chain), the extensibility of a muscle will affect
the ROM of every joint in the limb, whether it crosses them or not. For
example, if the foot is flat and the trunk is vertical (as in a single-leg wall
squat), the amount of knee flexion is determined by the amount of ankle
and hip flexion (Zatsiorsky 1998). A limitation in the ROM at either the
hip, knee, or ankle can affect the amount of motion at the other two joints
because of this coupling of joint rotations. Similarly, bilateral movements
(such as the squat) involve two limbs moving in parallel. To maintain bilateral symmetry, joint motion is coupled not only between the joints of the
same limb but also between the joints of the opposite limb.

Sport Performance and Mobility
Relating performance or injury potential to any one variable is difficult
because, by its very nature, human movement is multifactorial (involving
mobility, strength, power, endurance, and neuromuscular control). Additionally, the outcome (performance, injury) involves complex interactions
among the performer, task, and environment. While the optimal result in
a task requires a specific movement pattern that is performed in a stereotypical manner (Bobbert and van Ingen Schenau 1988), there is a range of
acceptable deviations and the performer should have enough mobility to
be able to exploit the use of those deviations when necessary. Based on a
preponderance of the evidence, it appears reasonable to conclude that every
task requires an optimal ROM from the performer so that correct posture
can be maintained, energy can be generated or absorbed by the muscles,
and the end effector (hand, foot) can be positioned properly in space.
Rather than being limited to a particular angle, acceptable mobility probably spans several degrees in either direction for a given task. Increasing
or decreasing mobility within this range will not affect performance or
injury potential (Thacker et al. 2004). However, hyper- and hypomobility
can have negative implications for performance and may lead to musculoskeletal injury if not corrected. Hypermobility may lead to an unstable joint
if that motion cannot be controlled (stability is discussed in chapter 12).
Hypomobility can lead to the negative consequences discussed next.

Posture
When ideal posture is maintained, intersegmental reaction and inertial forces
flow through the segments that are structurally best able to deal with them.
For alignment to be ideal, the tension on all of the muscles crossing the
joints must be balanced. Greater tension of muscles on one side of a joint,

281


282

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

and corresponding laxity on the other, could pull the body segments out of
alignment and require other structures (such as ligaments) to bear a larger
proportion of the stresses. For example, people with increased curvature
of the low back (hyperlordosis) were found to have increased strain on
the ligaments of the lumbar spine, which decreased with postural stability
exercises that included stretching (Scannell and McGill 2003).
Additionally, because posture is the position from which all movement
begins and ends, faulty posture can predispose a person to injury as a result of
increased stress on tissues that are ill equipped to deal with it. For example,
subtalar pronation and hip internal rotation are part of the normal energyabsorbing motions that occur during landing. People who start a landing
with more subtalar pronation or more hip internal rotation (or both) are
more likely to end the landing with more subtalar pronation or more hip
internal rotation (to achieve the same amount of motion). But this excessive ROM can lead to increased strain on the anterior cruciate ligament,
and subsequently tear it (Sigward, Ota, and Powers 2008).

Energy Generation and Absorption
Energy generation and absorption require that the joints involved produce
a force through a certain ROM. If the necessary motion of that joint in that
plane is inadequate, motion may occur at either a different joint, or at the
same joint in a different plane, to compensate for the deficiency. If a muscle
can produce force while acting concentrically over a larger ROM, it can
generate greater energy, improving performance. For example, the ROM of
shoulder external rotation in baseball pitchers is twice what is considered
normal (Werner et al. 2008). However, that amount of motion is necessary
because of the high correlation between shoulder external rotation and the
velocity of the ball at release (Whiteley 2007). Increased external rotation
means that force can be generated over a larger ROM of internal rotation,
increasing the amount of energy transferred to the ball.
Similarly, if a muscle can produce force while acting eccentrically over a
larger ROM, it can absorb more energy. Muscles have the largest energyabsorbing capability of any structure in the body (e.g., bone, cartilage,
ligaments). It is not surprising, then, that decreased shoulder internal
rotation ROM in baseball pitchers predisposes them to glenoid labral tears
(Burkhart, Morgan, and Kibler 2003). This is because the external rotators
(teres minor, infraspinatus) acting eccentrically to slow the arm down will
be able to absorb less energy after the ball is released.
These effects are not limited to the joints that a muscle crosses. As
explained earlier, flexion of the hip, knee, and ankle are coupled during
weight-bearing activities (Zatsiorsky 1998), and a limitation in the ROM of
any one joint may cause a decrease in the ROM of the other joints in the
chain. Limited ankle plantar flexion can decrease forward progression of
the tibia, limiting the amount of energy that can be absorbed by the plantar


Mobility

flexors. In an attempt to absorb the
energy further up the chain, increased
motion may occur in the frontal plane
(Sigward, Ota, and Powers 2008), collapsing the knee into a valgus position
(see figure 11.2). Unfortunately, this
position increases the energy absorbed
by the ligaments of the knee (Markolf
et al. 1995). Likewise, proper jumping requires energy to be transferred
from the proximal thigh to the distal
foot (Bobbert and van Ingen Schenau
1988). Limiting the ROM in the sagittal plane would decrease energy
generated by the leg muscles and, as a
result, jump height; and energy “leaking” into the frontal plane, in addition
to increasing injury risk, would not be
useful in increasing jump height.

Figure 11.2

Valgus collapse position.

Position of the End Effector
Activities of daily living and sport often require the hand or foot to be
positioned somewhere in space. Restrictions in hip mobility may lead to
injuries of the low back. Decreased hip flexion as a result of tight hamstrings
can cause someone to make up that deficit with increased spinal flexion in
activities such as a deadlift. However, spinal flexion decreases the ability
of the erector spinae to produce a posterior shear force by 60% (McGill,
Hughson, and Parks 2000) and limit the ability of the hip musculature to
push or pull a load (Lett and McGill 2006). Similarly, decreased ROM at the
glenohumeral joint requires compensatory motion at the thoracolumbar
spine (Fayad et al. 2008) during reaching tasks, which could potentially
move the spine out of the position in which it is best able to transfer forces.

Mobility Testing
Mobility is often assessed by determining the ROM of each DOF involved
in a movement. ROM can be tested either actively or passively and either
in isolation or integrated with the rest of the kinematic chain, giving four
possible permutations. Each permutation has a unique ROM value. Because
the utility of a value lies in comparing it to something else, fitness professionals must decide up front how they want to evaluate ROM so they can
make appropriate comparisons.
ROM is often classified as either active (AROM) or passive (PROM).
AROM is often thought of as the person moving his own joint, whereas

283


284

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

during PROM an evaluator (such as a personal trainer, strength coach, or
athletic trainer) moves the joint for the person. However, these definitions are not entirely correct. AROM is more accurately defined as when
the muscles responsible for moving a joint perform the movement. Conversely, PROM is when a force other than those muscles moves the joint.
For example, actively contracting the hamstring to flex the knee would be
an example of AROM. If an evaluator flexes the knee, or if a person flexes
her own knee using her arms, it is PROM. Although touching the toes from
a standing position is often considered AROM, it could be argued that it
is PROM because the force of gravity is involved in flexing the hips and
spine. In general, a joint usually has greater PROM than AROM because
of the ability of the external force to apply overpressure at the end range
of motion (Shultz, Houglum, and Perrin 2005), but this is not always the
case (Berryman Reese and Bandy 2002).
Both AROM and PROM are used to assess the motion of a joint. AROM
provides information about both the motion available at the joint and the
muscles’ ability to produce it. But because AROM requires the muscles to
generate sufficient torque to produce movement, it is not possible to differentiate among limited ROM due to weakness or pain of the muscle, lack of
flexibility, and some other pathology in the joint. This is why the American
Medical Association recommends testing both AROM and PROM (Berryman Reese and Bandy 2002) for those suspected of a physical impairment.
With a person who is healthy and asymptomatic, it is usually sufficient to
test either AROM or PROM, and not both. Corkery and colleagues (2007)
argued that AROM eliminates tester bias and standardizes measurements
because the person being tested is asked to move the joint to tolerance. It
would seem reasonable to test only AROM with healthy, asymptomatic
subjects, but this is a matter of the fitness professional’s personal preference.
Either way, the examiner just needs to be consistent about which one is
used, and annotate accordingly.
After determining whether to test AROM or PROM, the fitness professional has to decide whether to test the muscle in isolation or as part of the
kinematic chain and how to test them. A comparison of various mobility
tests is presented in table 11.4 (page 292). Testing the mobility of the kinematic chain can be done by simply watching the task (e.g., gait, throwing)
or by administering multijoint movement screens designed for the specific
purpose of examining the mobility of the chain (Cook 2001). Filming the
activity with a high-speed digital camera allows for a slow-motion playback
that can alert the examiner to an aberrant motion that may be missed by
the naked eye. Analyzing the digital images with commercially available
software allows the examiner to quantify the movement at each joint with
a high degree of accuracy, which makes this test highly reliable and valid
(Kadaba et al. 1989).
Movement screens, developed by Cook (2001), include a battery of tests
for evaluating the mobility of the kinematic chain: the deep squat, hurdle


Mobility

step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight-leg raise, trunk stability
push-up, and rotary stability of the trunk tests. As of this writing, neither
the validity nor the reliability of these screens has been published in peerreviewed journals, but the use of these screens might hold some promise
for predicting injury (Kiesel, Plisky, and Voight 2007). Further investigation
is warranted.
Isolated tests include single-joint tests and muscle length tests. With
single-joint tests, all muscles crossing multiple joints are put in a shortened
position across all joints they cross except the joint being tested. For example,
in testing hip joint flexion, the knee is also flexed so that the multijoint
hamstrings are shortened across the knee while being lengthened across
the hip. Such a test can be used to assess the flexibility of the monoarticular
hip extensors (Kendall, McCreary, and Provance 1993).
Muscle length tests are used to assess the flexibility of the multijoint
muscles by lengthening the muscle across all the joints it crosses (Kendall
et al. 1993). For example, to test the flexibility of the hamstrings, the hip is
flexed and the knee is extended, lengthening the muscle across both joints.
Single-joint muscles normally possess enough flexibility to allow a joint
to move through its full ROM, whereas multijoint muscles usually do not
unless they are shortened at the other joints they cross (Kendall et al. 1993).
A cross between isolated and integrated testing is composite testing, in
which motion is measured in two or more joints, albeit in a nonfunctional
pattern (Berryman Reese and Bandy 2002). The most popular example of
a composite test is the sit-and-reach test, which measures the composite
motion of hip and lumbar flexion. Other composite tests include the shoulder
lift test, fingertip-to-floor test, and Apley scratch test (Berryman Reese and
Bandy 2002). The problem with such tests is that they do not reveal the
contributions each joint makes to the movement. In the sit-and-reach test,
hypermobile hip extensors can compensate for hypomobile trunk extensors,
and vice versa. Therefore, the utility of these tests is limited.
A full assessment of mobility in a healthy, asymptomatic population is
a two-step process (see figure 11.3). The first step involves the analysis of
joint motion that is part of an integrated kinematic chain activity, which is
usually performed actively. Because of the number of tests that would have
to be performed to test every joint in the body, these screens can save time
by alerting the examiner to the presence of an aberrant movement pattern
in need of further attention. If an aberrant pattern is noted, the examiner
could have the person mimic the pattern in a gravity-eliminated position,
or move the person passively. This eliminates the need for strength, power,
or neuromuscular control, allowing the examiner to determine whether
the problem is indeed one of mobility.
To ascertain the exact location of the problem (if one exists), the next
step involves examining each joint in the kinematic chain in isolation.
Isolated testing requires both single-joint and muscle length tests. Isolated
testing should also be performed on all “problem” joints, which are sus-

ceptible to either hyper- or hypomobility because of either past history or
tasks performed on a regular basis. For example, a hurdler with a history
of hamstring strains should have hamstring flexibility assessed regularly.
A baseball pitcher, even when injury free, should have his glenohumeral
internal rotation ROM assessed regularly as part of an injury prevention
program.

Range of Motion Tests
There are too many functional movement patterns to include all of them
in a chapter of this size. Fitness professionals need to be familiar with the
biomechanics of the activities they are training their clients or athletes to
perform to appreciate what is normal or abnormal for that activity, and to
screen for abnormal movement patterns accordingly. Although movement
screens (Cook 2001) may hold promise, scientific evidence is not sufficient to
merit making recommendations concerning their use at this time. Conducting composite tests to assess flexibility is not recommended. Therefore, the
remainder of this chapter focuses on isolated ROM tests of muscle flexibility.
When measuring ROM, the examiner should have an appreciation of
the DOF quality, quantity, and end-feel. Each of these provides a unique
piece of information and should be considered part of the full assessment.


Mobility

The quality of the ROM is how the motion feels to both the examiner and
the subject and is therefore evaluated subjectively. Normal motion should
be full and fluid. Irregular, hesitant, jerky, or painful motion would signal
a problem with that movement (Houglum 2005).
The quantity of ROM is simply how much motion is available at a joint.
It can be measured either subjectively or objectively. However, several
authors have determined that objective measures are more accurate and
more reliable than subjective ones (Brosseau et al. 2001; Croxford, Jones,
and Barker 1998; Youdas, Bogard, and Suman 1993). With a qualitative
test, the evaluator examines the rotation and subjectively determines
whether the ROM is within normal limits, hypermobile, or hypomobile.
With a quantitative test, the evaluator measures the actual joint angle at
the end range of motion with a goniometer, inclinometer, or tape measure
(described in the next section). Normal ranges of motion for each joint are
presented in tables 11.1 and 11.2 for the extremities and spine, respectively.
The end-feel is what limits the range of motion. It is measured subjectively.
Normal end-feels can be soft, firm, or hard (Norkin and White 1995). A
soft end-feel occurs when two muscle bellies come in contact (e.g., when a
person flexes the elbow, the muscles of the forearm and upper arm contact
each other and limit further motion). A firm end-feel occurs when resistance
from the soft tissue prevents further motion, such as the hamstrings or joint
capsule preventing further motion when extending the knee. A hard endfeel occurs when two bones come in contact, such as during elbow extension when the olecranon process comes in contact with the olecranon fossa.
Normal end-feels for the joints are also presented in tables 11.1 and 11.2.
Abnormalities in either the quality or end-feel of the ROM are often
serious, and are beyond the scope of practice of a fitness professional. If
these problems are noted, the person in question should be referred to the
appropriate health care provider. Changing the quantity of motion is within
the scope of most fitness professionals, so it is important that they know
how to properly perform the tests and interpret the results. Table 11.4 on
page 292 provides a comparison of mobility evaluations.

Single-Joint Tests
ROM of a single joint can be measured qualitatively by visually inspecting
the joint in question as it reaches its end range of motion or by quantifying
it through the use of specialized instruments, including goniometers, inclinometers, and tape measures (see figure 11.4). In either case, the joint being
tested is moved through its full ROM while every other joint is stabilized. The
examiner must ensure that each multijoint muscle is stabilized in its slack
(or shortened) position. Both end ROMs for each DOF are then recorded.

Equipment
Goniometers, inclinometers, or tape measures
Procedure
1. The goniometer has two arms with a 360° marked circle in the center.
The arm with the circle is the fixed arm and should be placed along
a reference line on the heavier (proximal) segment.
2. The axis of rotation of the goniometer is placed coincident with the
axis of rotation of the joint. The other arm is the moving arm. and it
is placed along a reference line on the lighter (usually proximal) segment.
3. During either AROM or PROM, the joint is moved to the end of its
ROM, and the angle is measured on the goniometer.
4. The locations of the proximal arm, distal arm, and axis of rotation are
listed in table 11.1 for the extremities.

Mobility

Additional Considerations
With some joints, such as the spine, using a goniometer is difficult. In these
instances, either a tape measure or an inclinometer can be used. Here, the
absolute distance (tape measure) or segment angle (inclinometer), rather
than the relative joint angle, is measured between the moving segment
and some fixed reference point. The tape measure is used to determine
the distance between two vertebrae, and although it is appropriate for all
motions in the cervical spine, it is usually appropriate to measure only
spinal flexion in the thoracolumbar spine. The inclinometer makes use of
the difference between a segment’s beginning and ending position in relation to gravity, similar to a carpenter’s level (Berryman Reese and Bandy
2002). The ROM is determined by subtracting the reading at the inferior
landmark from the reading at the superior landmark. The thoracolumbar
spine and cervical spine are usually measured as different segments, with
representative values presented in table 11.2.

Muscle Length Tests
Muscle length tests are used to measure the flexibility of multijoint muscles.
Procedure
Although the procedures for muscle length tests are the same as those for
single-joint tests, the positioning of the joints is different. With single-joint
tests, each multijoint muscle is stabilized in its slack (or shortened) position,
and lengthened only across the joint being measured. With muscle length
tests, the process is repeated with the muscle in its lengthened position at
both its proximal and distal joints. In the case of polyarticular muscles, the
muscle is in its lengthened position at all of the joints that it crosses. The
positioning of the joints for both single-joint and muscle length tests of the
lower extremities are presented in table 11.3.
Norms
For muscle length tests, Kendall, McCreary, and Provance (1993) suggested
that the norm is for the muscle length to be approximately 80% of the total
range of motion for the two joints. An example is given for the muscle
length of the hamstrings. The hip joint has an approximate ROM of 135°
(10° of extension to 125° of flexion), and the knee joint has an approximate
ROM of 140° (0° of extension to 140° of flexion). The combined ROM of
the joints is the sum of 135 and 140, or 275°. With the hip flexed to 80°,
the knee’s ROM should still be 140° (or 80% of 275°). If the hip was flexed
to 90°, then the knee’s ROM should be 130° (from 10° to 130° of flexion).
Currently, no normative or reliability data are available for muscle length
tests of the upper extremities. These tests may be more appropriate for health
care practitioners, and interested readers are referred elsewhere (Berryman
Reese and Bandy 2002; Kendall, McCreary, and Provance 1993).

Interpretation of Results
After the measurement of ROM has been conducted, the results need to be
interpreted. Interpretation usually involves comparing the values obtained
to normative data or the minimum values required to perform an activity.
Values can also be compared bilaterally, or over time.
Values obtained during the test can be compared to normative data,
such as those presented in tables 11.1 through 11.3. However, these comparisons should be made with care, because there is no universal standard
for ROM. For example, although 90° of external rotation of the shoulder
is considered normal, baseball pitchers may have (and require) twice that
amount (Werner et al. 2008).
Values can also be compared to those normally considered required for
a given task. For example, the normal range of dorsiflexion is 20°, but 10°
is required for normal walking gait and 15° is required for normal running
gait, although a recent investigation (Weir and Chockalingam 2007) has
shown that the actual requirements for walking gait are highly variable,
between 12 and 22°. An appreciation of the biomechanics and variability of
various tasks is required to understand the ROM requirements of those tasks.
Bilateral comparisons (i.e., comparing the right and left sides) of the same
person is another way to interpret the results. There is no general consensus about how much difference between the two is acceptable. However,
some authors suggest that the two sides should be between 10% (Burkhart,
Morgan, and Kibler 2003) and 15% (Knapik et al. 1991) of each other. For
most people, this appears to be a reasonable standard.
Finally, the values of a joint can be compared to values of the same joint


Mobility

taken earlier. Comparing the same test on the same person over time is an
excellent way to quantify changes resulting from exercise, aging, or injury.
Because of the effects of temperature (Robertson, Ward, and Jung 2005) and
activity (Wenos and Konin 2004) on flexibility, examiners need to ensure
that pretest conditions are similar for comparisons to be valid. When pretest
conditions are standardized, these comparisons are among the best ways to
determine the effectiveness of an intervention program.
Mobility should be assessed to identify ROM deficits; athletes without
deficits will probably realize little benefit from increasing their mobility
(Haff et al. 2006). A decreased ROM should be considered a deficit under
the following conditions:
■■

■■

■■

■■

The decreased ROM alters the mechanics of a movement (either sport
specific or fundamental).
The joint ROM is not within normal limits for an athlete’s sport.
Athletes at or below the acceptable ROM, even if it does not appear
to affect their mechanics, should probably improve ROM to within
these limits.
A decreased ROM is the result of an injury, and the ROM is not
restored to preinjury levels.
A decreased ROM creates asymmetry bilaterally. Except in some rare
instances, the ROM should be comparable bilaterally (side-to-side
differences should be less than 10%).

Deficits are corrected by using stretching exercises that increase the ROM
of a joint. Biarticular muscles need to be lengthened across both ends while
being stretched. Techniques such as static stretching and PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) can be used. Stretches should be held for
approximately 30 seconds, with 10 seconds of rest between them. Four or
five repetitions should be performed, and stretching can be done twice or
three times per day.
Athletes with no deficits should be tested only periodically (perhaps
annually). Athletes with identified deficits should be tested more regularly.
Once the deficit has been corrected, occasional tests should be performed
to ensure that mobility is maintained at adequate levels.

The first step in assessing the mobility of an athlete is to conduct a needs
analysis for the athlete’s sport, determining the joints involved and the amplitude and directions of the movements necessary for that sport. This information is available for many popular sports in biomechanics texts and journals.
For example, baseball pitchers require approximately 170° of external rotation,
whereas American football quarterbacks require about 160° of external rotation
during a throw (Fleisig et al. 1996). Running requires 20° of hip extension,70°
of hip flexion, 110° of knee flexion, 30° of dorsiflexion, and 20° of plantarflexion
(Novacheck 1998), but the positions of the hip and knee immediately prior to
contact place the biceps femoris at 100% of its resting length (Thelen et al.
2006). Similar data should be found for other sports of interest.
The next step is to determine whether the athlete is performing the sporting
movements correctly. If possible, this should be done by observing the athlete
performing the sport. The gold standard would be a three-dimensional biomechanical analysis, which is expensive and time consuming (making it impractical
in a lot of situations). Watching with the human eye is the least preferred method
because people are unable to detect small changes, can view the performance
only once, and are hampered by the movement speed, leading to poor reliability


Mobility

and validity (Knudson and Morrison 1997). An alternative may be to record the
movement with a high-speed camcorder and view the recording multiple times
at slow speeds. The point is to compare the ranges of motion that the athlete
uses to normative data or some exemplary performance to determine whether
too little (or too much) motion is occurring at the various joints.
Even the process of observing recorded performances may be too timeconsuming for a large number of athletes. Screening of a more fundamental
movement pattern (such as a squat or lunge) may provide some information,
but the transfer of these movements to higher-level tasks (such as running
and cutting) has not been established. Different types of sporting activities
may require different fundamental movement patterns. For example, a baseball
pitcher may not need the same movement qualities as a wrestler.
The initial evaluation provides an assessment of movement quality. This
alerts the fitness professional to a problem, but does not reveal the cause of
that problem. A movement screen should not be prescriptive, because of the
multiple causative factors that could potentially be involved. A reasonable next
step would be to identify the cause of the problem by evaluating each potential
cause individually. This would start with the mobility of each joint in the chain.
Consider a case in which an athlete exhibits valgus collapse during drop landings from a box (see figure 11.2). This is considered a faulty movement pattern.
This problem could be a result of a lack of mobility, strength, power, endurance,
or neuromuscular control of any of the joints in the lower extremity. The athlete
performs a squat in a gravity-eliminated position (such as on a Total Gym or sled
machine), which reveals signs of valgus collapse. This suggests the need for
an evaluation of the mobility of the joints in the chain, specifically looking for
any of the following factors: restricted hip external rotation (Sigward, Ota, and
Powers 2008; Willson, Ireland, and Davis 2006), limited ankle plantarflexion
(Sigward, Ota, and Powers 2008), or restricted supination of the subtalar joint
(Loudon, Jenkins, and Loudon 1996). Determining the problem joint can only
be accomplished by examining the mobility of each joint individually using the
ROM tests described in this chapter and comparing the results to the norms in
table 11.1. If the ROM appears to be within normal limits, the problem is either
with another joint or with another motor quality (strength, power, endurance,
neuromuscular control). This will require further testing.
Potential or previous problem areas should also be examined when conducting ROM testing. Shoulder injury is always a potential problem for pitchers, and
a deficit in glenohumeral internal rotation can be a contributing factor. Each
athlete should be examined for a deficit in internal rotation using either absolute (ROM < 25°) of relative (bilateral differences > 25°) measures (Burkhart,
Morgan, and Kibler 2003). A previous injury will alter the material properties of
the hamstrings, subjecting them to greater strains and making them more susceptible to injury in the future (Silder, Reeder, and Thelen 2010). Athletes with
known previous hamstring injuries should be evaluated using a muscle length
test of the hamstrings, and the results should be compared both to normative
data (table 11.1) and to the hamstrings on the unaffected side.

(continued)

Mobility testing should be aimed at identifying deficits. A deficit should be
considered any decrease in ROM that alters the mechanics of the movement
(either a sport-specific skill or fundamental movement pattern), does not fall
within the normal limits required for the specific sport or activity, creates a
bilateral asymmetry, or all of these. These deficits should then be targeted
for intervention using stretching techniques such as static stretching or PNF
(proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation). Each stretch should be held for
approximately 30 seconds and repeated four or five times with 10 seconds of
rest between them. Stretching exercises can be performed twice or three times
a day, but because of the decreases in neuromuscular performance (Stone et al.
2006), they should not be performed before activities with high force or power
requirements. Athletes with no identified ROM deficiencies will likely receive
little to no benefit from a stretching program, and should focus their efforts on
the other motor abilities discussed in this book.

Summary

■■

Mobility is a fundamental component of effective and efficient human
movement.
A thorough assessment of mobility requires an examination of the
quality, quantity, and end-feel of every joint in the kinematic chain
of an aberrant movement pattern, as well as those areas prone to
injury either for the person or for that activity.
Values obtained from a mobility test should be compared to established
norms, to values of the same joint on the opposite side of the body,
to values of the same joint taken earlier, or all of these.
Although human movement is complex and multifactorial, less-thanoptimal mobility in a given task can impair performance and increase
the potential for injury.
