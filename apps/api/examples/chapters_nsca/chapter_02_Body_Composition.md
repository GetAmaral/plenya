Body Composition
Nicholas A. Ratamess, PhD, CSCS*D, FNSCA

Body composition is a term that describes the relative proportions of fat, bone,
and muscle mass in the human body. Anthropometry is a term that describes
the measurement of the human body in terms of dimensions such as
height, weight, circumferences, girths, and skinfolds. Body composition and
anthropometric tests have become standard practice for coaches, athletes,
and fitness professionals. Valuable information regarding percent body fat
(i.e., an estimate of the proportion of fat tissue within the human body),
fat distribution, lean tissue mass (i.e., the mass of all nonfat tissue such as
bones, muscles, and water), and limb lengths and circumferences may be
gained through body composition testing.
Body composition tests may be useful for evaluating training, diet, or
athletic performance, or for reducing the risk factors associated with musculoskeletal injury. For example, a body composition test may determine
that an athlete is approximately 5 pounds (2.3 kg) over his desired weight
and that his percent body fat is slightly higher (~1-2%) than normal. This
information can help the coach and athlete determine training and dietary
strategies. The coach may recommend a small reduction in daily kilocalorie
intake (or just limitations in simple sugars or dietary fats), an increase in
activity level to increase daily kilocalorie expenditure, or both, to reduce
body fat. The athlete may add an additional 15 minutes of low- to moderateintensity cardiorespiratory exercise at the end of a workout two or three
days per week until he attains his ideal body mass and percent fat. Frequent
testing will help him monitor his progress and assess the efficacy of the
strategies used to attain his target body composition level.
Body composition is one of the five major health-related components
of fitness (in addition to muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and
cardiorespiratory endurance), and its assessment has many benefits to
children, adolescents and teenagers, adults, and elderly people, as well as

15

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

performance benefits to athletes (American College of Sports Medicine
2008). In addition, body composition affects the other health-related components of fitness—that is, body mass, lean body mass, and fat content affect
muscle strength and endurance, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory endurance.
In general, knowledge of one’s percent body fat serves as a starting point
for comparison; people do not know how they rank compared to others
of their gender and age (via classification standards) until their body composition is assessed. They can use this information as a tracking metric for
subsequent weight loss, weight gain, or exercise-related training programs.
For example, body composition measurements are useful for athletes
in some weight-controlled sports in which body fat levels and hydration
(water content) can fall to low levels. Sports such as gymnastics, wrestling,
and bodybuilding require athletes to compete at either low weight or low
body fat levels. Athletes in these sports can benefit greatly from routine
body composition evaluations.
Body composition analysis can also benefit the athlete who is training to
increase muscle mass; lean tissue mass measurements can be used to evaluate training programs and measure progress. In addition, body composition
tests are very useful for determining health and wellness. An excess amount
of body fat, or obesity (especially in the abdominal area), is a risk factor
linked to several diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), certain types of cancer, low
back pain, and osteoarthritis (Despres and Lemieux 2006; Liuke et al. 2005;
Wearing et al. 2006).
Historically, some people have attempted to assess obesity via height–
weight tables. One popular method involved the use of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance table from 1983. This table established an optimal weight
range for men and women with small, medium, and large frames. For
example, a 6-foot (183 cm) male with a large frame would be considered
overweight if he weighed more than 188 pounds (85 kg). Overweight is a
weight in excess of the recommended range. However, overweight does not
necessarily reflect obesity, because weight alone doesn’t necessarily mean
that one has a high percentage of body fat. Thus, overweight is a term more
suited for sedentary populations and not athletes or those who exercise regularly. An athlete with greater lean tissue mass will also have a higher body
weight; thus, height–weight tables have little value in the athletic world.
Body weight itself is not a direct risk factor per se. However, an excessive
amount of body fat poses major health risks. Determining percent body fat
yields greater insight into health and fitness levels than body weight does.

Sport Performance and Body Composition
Sport performance is highly dependent on the health- and skill-related
components of fitness (power, speed, agility, reaction time, balance, and


Body Composition

coordination) in addition to the athlete’s technique and level of competency in sport-specific motor skills. All fitness components depend on body
composition to some extent. An increase in lean body mass contributes to
strength and power development. Strength and power are related to muscle
size. Thus, an increase in lean body mass enables the athlete to generate more force in a specific period of time. A sufficient level of lean body
mass also contributes to speed, quickness, and agility performance (in the
development of force applied to the ground for maximal acceleration and
deceleration). Reduced nonessential body fat contributes to muscular and
cardiorespiratory endurance, speed, and agility development. Additional
weight (in the form of nonessential fat) provides greater resistance to athletic
motion thereby forcing the athlete to increase the muscle force of contraction
per given workload. The additional body fat can limit endurance, balance,
coordination, and movement capacity. Joint range of motion can be negatively affected by excessive body mass and fat as well, and mass can form
a physical barrier to joint movement in a complete range of motion. Thus,
athletes competing in sports that require high levels of flexibility benefit
from having low levels of body fat.
The demands of the sport require that athletes maintain standard levels
of body composition. Some sports require athletes to be large in stature,
mass, or both, whereas some athletes prosper when they are small in stature. For example, linemen in American football and heavyweight wrestlers
need high levels of body mass. Although lean body mass is ideal, these
athletes can benefit from mass increases in either form (fat included).
Greater mass provides these athletes with more inertia, enabling them to
play their positions with greater stability provided speed and agility are
not compromised. Strength and power athletes such as American football
players, wrestlers, and other combat athletes; powerlifters; bodybuilders;
weightlifters; and track and field throwers benefit greatly from high levels of
lean body mass. Endurance athletes such as distance runners, cyclists, and
triathletes benefit greatly from having low percent body fat. Athletes such
as gymnasts, wrestlers, high jumpers, pole vaulters, boxers, mixed martial
artists, and weightlifters benefit greatly from having a high strength-to-mass
(and power-to-mass) ratio. Training to maximize strength and power while
minimizing changes in body mass (and keeping body fat low) is of great
value to these sports. Gymnasts, pole vaulters, and high jumpers have to
overcome their body weights to obtain athletic success. Thus, minimizing
changes in mass enables greater flight height, time, and aerial athleticism.
Wrestlers, boxers, mixed martial artists, powerlifters, and weightlifters compete in weight classes. Because higher weight classes may denote
more difficult competition, these athletes benefit from improving strength
and power while maintaining their normal weight class. Athletes such as
baseball and softball players benefit from increased lean body mass and
reduced body fat. The additional lean mass can assist in power, speed, and

17

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

agility, and keeping body fat low assists with endurance, quickness, speed,
and agility as well (for performing skills such as throwing, hitting, fielding,
and base running).
Basketball and soccer are two of several combination anaerobic and
aerobic sports in which athletes need power, speed, quickness, agility, and
strength yet also moderate to high levels of aerobic fitness. Athletes from
both of these sports benefit from having low body fat while maintaining or
increasing lean body mass. Although some athletes can tolerate higher levels
of body mass and perhaps percent body fat, it is generally recommended
that data obtained from frequent body composition measurements be used
to develop training plans aimed at reducing body fat while maintaining or
increasing lean body mass.

Practical Applications
The measurement and quantification of percent body fat is of great
importance for fitness practitioners, coaches, trainers, and athletes for
several reasons. The measurement of percent body fat allows athletes
to identify where they rank (e.g., lean, average, high, obese) according
to standards and can be used to identify athletes at the extremes (e.g.,
at risk for obesity or eating disorders, which are especially a concern
for female athletes in weight-controlled sports).
Athletes can use body fat data to modify training, diet, or both, to
achieve the desired body fat level for their sports. For example, an athlete with too high a level of body fat can increase aerobic exercise duration, increase volume and decrease rest interval length for resistance
exercise (to increase the metabolic demand and energy expenditure),
or reduce kilocalorie intake (primarily by decreasing saturated fat and
simple carbohydrate intake) to favor a net energy deficit that can lower
body fat. If an eating disorder (e.g., bulimia or anorexia nervosa) is
identified in an athlete whose body mass and fat levels are lower than
expected, attempts can be made to assist the athlete with nutritional
and psychological counseling.
Body composition testing generates descriptive data of athletes for
various sports and positions. This is particularly useful from a research
perspective but can benefit a coach over time when norms are developed. Coaches can use these data to compare their athletes to other
athletes in the league or conference and can compare their current
athletes to former athletes in the program. This can be used to identify
trends in player body composition over time.
Body composition testing also serves as a starting point for program
evaluation. For example, if an athlete has 20.8% body fat at the beginning of a program, and after 12 weeks of training has 18.6%, the coach


Body Composition

and athlete can conclude that the program resulted in a 2.2% reduction
in body fat.
Athletes in weight-controlled sports or making weight for weight
classes can use body composition testing to identify a safe percent fat
low point, or minimal weight. Percent fat should not be lower than 4%
in males and 10% in females for extended periods of time. If percent
fat approaches these values, modifications can be made (i.e., no more
weight loss or a change in weight class).
Some body composition tests (e.g., DEXA) can yield critical information such as bone mineral density, total body water, and lean tissue
mass. Lean tissue mass can be calculated from skinfold analyses or
any method used to determine percent body fat. These can be used
to evaluate training adaptations particularly to a resistance training
program targeting muscle hypertrophy.
Body fat measurement allows for the calculation of ideal body weight
or fat mass. For example, an athlete who weighs 215 pounds (98 kg)
with a percent fat of 15% targets a percent fat of 13% (or less) and a
weight of 210 pounds (95 kg). Initially, this athlete has 32.3 pounds
(14.7 kg) of body fat (215 lb × 0.15 = 32.3 lb; or 98 × 0.15 = 14.7).
He knows he can safely reach this weight because he has 32.3 pounds
(14.7 kg) of fat but only desires to lose 5 pounds (2.3 kg). On the other
hand, his ideal body weight can be calculated when he sets a target
body fat level (in this case, going from 15 to 13%). Ideal body weight
(IBW) can be calculated as follows:
IBW = (body weight – fat weight) / (1.00 – desired % / 100)
IBW = (215 lb – 32.3 lb) / (1.00 – 13% / 100)
IBW = 182.7 lb / (1.00 – 0.13)
IBW = 182.7 lb / 0.87
IBW = 210 lb

Body Composition Measurement
There are no truly direct methods for measuring body composition. Rather,
most body composition measurements involve indirect assessment, or estimation. Each method has advantages and disadvantages as noted in the many
studies that have made direct comparisons. The decision of which method
to use depends on several factors, including the needs of the client, the purpose of the evaluation, the cost of the measurements or equipment needed,
the availability of each measurement tool, the training of the technician,
and the weighted advantages and disadvantages of each. Several common
and practical body composition measurement techniques are discussed in
this chapter.

Measuring Height, Body Weight, and Body Mass
Index
Height and body weight and mass measurements are easy to perform. They
can provide useful body composition data. Height can change throughout
the day (based on spinal loading and vertebral disc volume) and more
significantly with aging. Because of its relatively low magnitude of daily
fluctuation, height in adults does not need to be measured frequently. The
measurement of body weight can be performed frequently especially during
weight loss or weight gain training programs or when athletes are reducing
weight to compete in a weight class.

Height
Equipment
Height should be measured with a stadiometer (a vertical ruler mounted
on a wall with a wide horizontal headboard). Although many commercial
scales have an attached vertical ruler, these devices are less reliable. Failure
to follow accepted standards reduces reliability and accuracy.
Procedure
1. The subject removes shoes.
2. The subject stands as straight as possible with heels together near the
wall.
3. The subject takes a deep breath, holds it, and stands with head level,
looking straight ahead.
4. The height of the subject is recorded in inches or centimeters
(1 in. = 2.54 cm).

Body Weight and Mass
Body weight and mass represent different kinetic variables. In biomechanics, body mass is the amount of matter an object or person consists of,
whereas weight is a force measurement—that is, the product of mass and
acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m · s–2) depending on the effects of gravity. Both are measured the same way. However, body mass is expressed
in kilograms, whereas body weight is expressed in pounds or sometimes
Newtons (N). Clothing is also an issue, and the type and amount of clothing must be standardized. Body weight changes at various times of day
as a result of meal and beverage consumption, urination, defecation, and
dehydration, or water loss. Therefore, a standard time (e.g., early in the
morning) is recommended.


Body Composition

Equipment
Body weight and body mass are best measured on a calibrated physician’s
scale with a beam and movable weights.
Procedure
1. Clothing must be standardized and shoes must be removed. Accuracy
is greatest with minimal clothing. A subject wearing clothing should
empty pockets and remove jewelry.
2. The subject steps onto the scale and the weight is recorded upon stabilization of the beam. Body weight is recorded in pounds, or body
mass is recorded in kilograms (1 kg = 2.2 lb; 1 N = 0.224 lb; 1 lb =
4.448 N).

Body Mass Index
Body mass index (BMI) is used to assess body mass relative to height:
BMI (kg · m–2) = body mass (kg) / height squared (m2)
BMI has been used to determine the risk of developing diseases such as type
2 diabetes, hypertension, and CVD and is very easy to calculate.
Procedure
Body mass index may also be calculated using the following equation: BMI
= body weight (lb) × 703 / height2 (in.2). For example, a man who is 195
pounds (88.6 kg) and 6 feet 3 inches (190.5 cm, or 1.905 m) would have a
BMI of 24.4 kg · m–2 and would be considered normal when compared to
BMI standards. The current BMI (kg · m–2) standards for men and women in
the United States are as follows (American College of Sports Medicine 2007):
BMI < 18.5 indicates underweight
BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal
BMI of 25 to 29.9 indicates overweight
BMI of 30 to 39.9 is obese
BMI > 40 indicates morbid obesity
Although simplistic in its calculation, BMI has greater practical relevance
in sedentary and clinical populations. It strongly correlates with disease
and is easy to use in large populations. Criticisms of the use of BMI are
that it is a relatively poor predictor of body fat percent, is not indicative of
weight distribution, and may result in inaccurate classifications (normal,
overweight, obese) for muscular people, athletes, and those who play collegiate or professional sports. For example, one study that examined body
composition in National Football League players in the United States showed

21


22

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

that based on BMI, every player was classified as overweight, obese, or very
obese despite having body fat percentages of 6.3 to 18.5% (with offensive
linemen at 25.1%) (Kraemer et al. 2005). A recent study examining NCAA
Division I American football players showed across all positions a mean BMI
of 29.8 kg · m–2 despite an average percent body fat of ~15 ± 7% (Kaiser et
al. 2008). Another study of American football players showed BMI to be
an invalid measure because it overestimated being overweight and obese in
more than 50% of the athletes (Mathews and Wagner 2008). This appears
to be the case with strength and power athletes from other sports as well.
Thus, BMI is not a particularly useful body composition measurement tool
in resistance-trained populations.

Waist-to-Hip Ratio
The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) compares the circumferences of the waist to
that of the hip and is used as an indicator of body fat distribution (i.e., the
apple or pear physique) or as a measure of general health. A high WHR has
been recognized as a risk factor for disease. An advantage of this technique
is that it is simple to administer and requires only a tape measure. In some
cases, WHR may be a better predictor of mortality than BMI. However,
because it is a circumference ratio, it does not provide an indication of percent body fat. Skinfold measurement (or other body fat technique) provides
a more accurate estimation of percent body fat. Critical to the accuracy and
reliability of WHR measurement is standardization of the circumference
technique. Standards for WHR values are shown in table 2.1.
Equipment
A flexible tape measure (such as a Gulick II tape measure)
Procedure
1. All that is needed for this procedure is a flexible tape measure. A Gulick
II tape measure is beneficial because it applies a constant amount of
tension to the tape, thereby eliminating variability among examiners.
2. The waist circumference should be taken around the smallest area of
the waist, typically ~1 inch (2.54 cm) above the navel.
3. The hip circumference is taken around the largest area of the buttocks
(with minimal clothing).
4. The WHR is calculated as the waist circumference (cm or in.) / hip
circumference (cm or in.) and is expressed with no units because they
cancel each other out during the process of division.
5. Multiple measurements should be taken until each is within ¼ inch
(0.6 cm) of each other.

Skinfold Measurement
Skinfold measurement is one of the most popular and practical methods for
estimating percent body fat, and can be relatively accurate provided that a
trained technician is performing the measurement with high-quality calipers
(e.g., a Lange or Harpenden caliper that provides a constant pressure of ~10
g · mm–2). Skinfold analysis is based on the principle that the amount of
subcutaneous fat (fat immediately below the skin) is directly proportional
to the total amount of body fat.
Following the collection of skinfold measurements, regression analysis (a
statistical procedure used to predict a dependent variable based on one or
more independent or predictor variables) is used to estimate total percent
body fat. The sum of the skinfolds, along with gender and age (which are
known significant predictors of body fat), are used in a regression analysis,
which ultimately calculates a prediction equation to estimate body density
and percent body fat. Variability in percent body fat prediction from skinfold
analysis is approximately ±3 to 5% assuming that appropriate techniques
and equations have been used (American College of Sports Medicine 2008).
Body fat varies with gender, age, race or ethnicity, training status, and other
factors. Therefore, numerous regression equations using a combination of
skinfold sites have been developed to predict body density and fat from
skinfold measurements.
Skinfold measurement is most accurate when prediction equations are
used that closely match the population being tested. The number of sites
needs to be predetermined based on the regression equation or methods
used (i.e., three, four, or seven sites). Both seven- and three-site skinfold
equations have shown similar standard errors of estimate in men (±3.4 to
3.6%) and women (±3.8 to 3.9%) (American College of Sports Medicine
2007).

Equipment
High-quality calipers (e.g., Lange or Harpenden)
Procedure
1. The number of sites and equations should first be selected based on
the population tested. Skinfold sites are shown in figure 2.1.
2. A fold of skin is firmly grasped between the thumb and index finger
of the left hand (about 8 cm apart on a line perpendicular to the long
axis of the site) and lifted away from the body while the subject is
relaxed. Following are commonly used skinfold sites:
Abdomen: Horizontal fold; 2 centimeters to the right of the umbilicus
■■
Biceps: Vertical fold on the anterior aspect of the arm over the belly
of the biceps muscle
■■
Chest or pectoral: Diagonal fold; half the distance between the
anterior axillary line and the nipple (in men), or one third the distance between the anterior axillary line and the nipple (in women)
■■
Midaxillary: Horizontal fold on the midaxillary line at the level of
the xiphoid process of the sternum
■■
Subscapular: Diagonal fold at a 45° angle, 1 to 2 centimeters below
the inferior angle of the scapula
■■
Suprailiac: Diagonal fold in line with the natural angle of the iliac
crest taken in the anterior axillary line
■■
Thigh: Vertical fold on the anterior midline of the thigh midway
between the proximal border of the patella and the inguinal crease
■■
Triceps: Vertical fold on the posterior midline of the upper arm
midway between the acromion process of the scapula and the
inferior part of the olecranon process of the elbow
A slight muscular contraction of the subject or a finger roll of the fold
ensures that subcutaneous tissue is measured and not skeletal muscle.
For obese people, a large grasping area (i.e., >8 cm) may be needed
and could possibly exceed the measurement capacity of the caliper.
While the caliper is facing up, the jaws of the caliper are placed over
the skinfold 1 centimeter below the fingers of the tester.
The caliper grip is released and the measurement is subsequently taken
within three seconds.
All measurements are taken on the right side of the body in duplicate
or triplicate for consistency among measurements to the nearest 0.5
millimeter. If there is more than a 3-millimeter difference between
readings, a fourth measurement may be needed.

7. It is important to rotate through the sites as opposed to taking two or
three measurements sequentially from the same site.
8. Each site is averaged and summed to estimate body density and percent body fat via a regression equation or prediction table. The total
is viewed in a table relative to gender and age, and percent body fat
is given.

Critical to skinfold analysis is the selection of an appropriate prediction
equation. It is important to note that several equations are used to estimate body density, and a subsequent body density calculation is used to
estimate percent body fat. Body density is described as the ratio of body
mass to body volume. Table 2.2 depicts several equations used to estimate
percent body fat from body density estimates. Since the early 1950s, more
than 100 regression equations have been developed to predict body density
and percent fat. Equations that have been cross-validated in other studies
to support their efficacy should be chosen based on gender, age, ethnicity,
and activity level. However, general equations have been shown to produce
accurate estimates across all segments of the population (i.e., those with
very high and low levels of body fat in addition to those whose body fat is
near the population mean) and may be easier to use because only one or
two equations are used as opposed to several (Graves et al. 2006). Because
the relationship between body density and subcutaneous fat is curvilinear,
quadratic and logarithmic terms have been added to most regression equations to increase their accuracy. Once body density has been determined,
percent body fat can be calculated. Most often, the Siri (1956) or Brozek
(Brozek et al. 1963) equations are used:
Siri equation: (4.95 / Bd – 4.50) × 100
Brozek equation: (4.57 / Bd – 4.142) × 100
*where Bd = body density
However, other population-specific equations (see table 2.3 on page 28)
have been developed to estimate percent fat from body density based on
ethnicity, gender, and age (Harman and Garhammer 2008). See table 2.4
on page 38 for information on when it is beneficial to perform BMI measurement. Table 2.5 on page 39 provides percent body fat classifications.

Girth Measurements
Girth measurements entail measuring the circumference of a body limb or
region. In addition to providing useful information regarding changes in
muscle size resulting from training, girth measurements, either alone or in
combination with skinfold measurements, provide information regarding
body composition. The advantages of taking circumference measurements
is that doing so is easy, quick, and inexpensive and does not require specialized equipment. Accurate estimates of percent body fat (i.e., ±2.5 to 4%)
can be made via girth measurements. Common sites measured include the
right upper arm, abdomen, and right forearm for young men; buttocks
(hip), abdomen, and right forearm for older men; abdomen, right thigh,
and right forearm for young women; and abdomen, right thigh, and right
calf for older women.

2. Duplicate measures should be taken at each site, and the average is
used. If readings differ by more than 5 millimeters, then an additional
measurement is taken.
3. Subjects should remain relaxed while measurements are taken.
4. A large source of error is a lack of standardization of the measurement
site. The correct placement of the tape measure per site is as follows:
■■
Chest: The tape is placed around the chest at level of the fourth ribs
after the subject abducts the arms. Measurement is taken when
the subject adducts the arms back to the starting position and at
the end of respiration.
■■
Shoulder: The tape is placed horizontally at the maximal circumference of the shoulders while the subject is standing relaxed.
■■
Abdomen: The tape is placed over the abdomen at the level of the
greatest circumference (often near the navel) while the subject is
standing relaxed.
■■
Right thigh: The tape is placed horizontally over the thigh below
the gluteal level at the largest circumference (i.e., upper thigh)
while the subject is standing.
■■
Right calf: The tape is placed horizontally over the largest circumference of the calf midway between the knee and ankle while the
subject is standing relaxed.

■■

Waist and hip: The tape is placed around the smallest area of the
waist, typically ~1 inch (2.54 cm) above the navel. The hip circumference is taken around the largest area of the buttocks (with
minimal clothing).
Right upper arm: The tape is placed horizontally over the midpoint
of the upper arm between the shoulder and elbow while the subject
is standing relaxed and the elbow is extended.
Right forearm: The tape is placed horizontally over the proximal
area of the forearm where the circumference is the largest while
the subject is standing relaxed.

Estimations of percent body fat from circumferences can be made once
values have been obtained. Age- and gender-specific equations have been
developed to estimate percent fat. Equations for young and older men and
women are based on a calculation of constants. Once constants are obtained,
these values can be used in the following equations to estimate percent
body fat. Circumference estimation of percent fat has an accuracy of ±2.5
to 4.0%. Table 2.4 on page 38 provides percent body fat classifications.
Circumference Percent Body Fat Estimation Equations
(American College of Sports Medicine 2007; McArdle, Katch,
and Katch 2007)
Young men: Constant A + B – C – 10.2 = percent body fat
Young women: Constant A + B – C – 19.6 = percent body fat
Older men: Constant A + B – C – 15.0 = percent body fat
Older women: Constant A + B – C – 18.4 = percent body fat

Hydrodensitometry
Hydrodensitometry (underwater, or hydrostatic, weighing) has historically
been considered the criterion method, or gold standard, for body composition analysis even though it is an indirect method. Hydrodensitometry is
based on Archimedes’ principle for determining body density where a body
immersed in water encounters a buoyant force that results in weight loss
equal to the weight of the water displaced during immersion. Subtracting
the subject’s body weight in water from the body weight on land provides
the weight of the displaced water. Body fat contributes to buoyancy because
the density of fat (0.9007 g · cm–3) is less than water (1 g · cm–3), whereas
lean tissue mass (≥1.100 g · cm–3) exceeds the density of water.
It is important to note that lean tissue density varies based on ethnicity
and maturation. African Americans have been shown to have an average
density of 1.113 g · cm–3, and Hispanics have shown an average value of
1.105 g · cm–3 compared to Caucasians (1.100 g · cm–3) (McArdle, Katch,

29


30

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

and Katch 2007). Children and older adults have lower lean tissue densities
than young adults. In addition, disproportionately large increases in muscle
mass (from resistance training) compared to bone mineral density changes
can lower body density and result in an overestimate of percent body fat
(McArdle, Katch, and Katch 2007). Body density (mass / volume) is calculated and then converted to percent body fat using an equation such as the
Siri (1956) or Brozek (1963) equations. Population-specific equations (e.g.,
for African Americans, Indians, Hispanics, Japanese, and Caucasians) have
been developed to more accurately convert body density data into percent
body fat (American College of Sports Medicine 2007).
Because hydrodensitometry is considered a gold standard, other body
composition measurement tools (e.g., skinfolds, bioelectrical impedance)
are validated against it. Test–retest reliability is high when procedures are
followed correctly. However, practical limitations can make hydrodensitometry difficult in certain situations. The cost and specialized use of the
equipment needed is great, and may be impractical in certain facilities. The
time involved in each measurement is lengthy, which could make other
body composition measurements more attractive. Lastly, many subjects
express fear and discomfort about needing to be fully submerged in water.
The following variables must be known when performing hydrodensitometry:
■■ Residual volume: The amount of air remaining in the lungs following
full expiration. Residual volume can be measured or predicted using
a combination of age, gender, and height. A substantial amount of
air left in the lungs increases buoyancy, which may be mistaken as
additional body fat.
■■ Water density: Water density varies with water temperature, because
buoyancy decreases with warmer temperatures.
■■ Amount of trapped gas in the gastrointestinal system: Typically, a predicted
constant of 100 milliliters is used.
■■ Dry body weight.
■■ Body weight in water.
Equipment
A tank made of stainless steel, fiberglass, ceramic tile, Plexiglas, or other
material (or a swimming pool) that is at least 4 × 4 × 5 feet (1.2 × 1.2 × 1.5
m). A seat suspended from a scale or force transducer is needed to allow
subjects to be weighed while they are completely submerged in water.
Procedure
1. Subjects should wear minimal clothing. A tight-fitting bathing suit
that traps little air is recommended.
2. Subjects should remove all jewelry and have urinated and defecated
prior to the procedure.


Body Composition

3. Subjects should be 2 to 12 hours postabsorptive and have avoided foods
that increase gas in the gastrointestinal tract. Menstruation may pose
a problem for females because of associated water gain; thus, women
should try to avoid being tested within seven days of menstruation.
4. A seat suspended from a scale or force transducer is needed to allow
subjects to be weighed while completely submerged in water. The
temperature of the water should be between 33 and 36 °C (91.4 and
96.8 °F).
5. The subject is weighed on land to determine dry weight, and the mass
is converted to grams.
6. The subject enters the tank, removes potential trapped air from the
skin, hair, suit, and so on, and attains a seated position while supported by a belt to minimize fluctuations.
7. Once the subject is seated and the chair height has been adjusted, the
subject fully expires as much air as possible prior to leaning forward
to be weighed.
8. The subject is weighed 5 to 10 times while submerged underwater
for 5 to 10 seconds. The highest of the weights or the average of the
three highest weights are used for analysis. The weight of the chair
and belt need to be considered in the calculation.
9. Residual lung volume (RV) can be measured directly (which increases
accuracy) in some systems or estimated based on height and age:
Males: RV (L) = [0.019 × ht (cm)] + [0.0155 × age (yrs)] – 2.24
Females: RV (L) = [0.032 × ht (cm)] + [0.009 × age (yrs)] – 3.90
Body density is calculated using the following equation:
BD = Mass in air (g)
[Mass in air (g) – mass in water (g)] – [RV (mL)]
Density of water
10. Body fat can be calculated using the Siri, Brozek, or population-specific
equations mentioned previously (p. 26). Table 2.4 on page 38 provides
percent body fat classifications.

Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a noninvasive and easy-to-administer tool for determining body composition. The underlying principle for
BIA is that electrical conductivity in the body is proportional to the fat-free
tissue of the body (American College of Sports Medicine 2007; McArdle,
Katch, and Katch 2007). A small electrical current is sent through the body
(from ankle to wrist), and the impedance to that current is measured. Lean
tissue (mostly water and electrolytes) is a good electrical conductor (i.e., has

31


32

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

low impedance), whereas fat is a poor conductor and impedes an electrical
current. Thus, BIA can be used to measure percent body fat and total body
water. Single- and multifrequency currents can be used to determine body
composition; multifrequency currents are more sensitive to the body’s fluid
compartments (McArdle, Katch, and Katch 2007). Most studies examining
BIA have used the equation V = pL2 · R–1, where V is the volume of the
conductor, p is the specific resistance of the tissue, L is the length of the
conductor, and R is the observed resistance (Graves et al. 2006).
Equipment
A variety of BIA analyzers are commercially available and vary widely in
price.
Procedure
1. The BIA device should be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. The subject lies supine on a nonconductive surface with arm and legs
at the side, not in contact with the rest of the body.
3. The right hand and wrist and right foot and ankle areas are prepared
with an alcohol pad and then allowed to dry.
4. BIA electrodes are placed on the metacarpal of the right index finger
and the metatarsal of the right big toe, and the reference (detecting)
electrodes are placed on the right wrist (bisecting the ulnar and radial
styloid processes) and the right ankle (midpoint on the line bisecting
the medial and lateral malleoli).
5. The current is applied and the BIA analyzer computes the impedance
and percent body fat.
6. New BIA devices are simpler to use than older ones and require only
that the subject either stand on the machine (i.e., an electronic digital
platform scale with built-in stainless steel foot pad electrodes) with
both bare feet or hold the BIA analyzer in both hands. The device
provides instructions to the subject (i.e., when to stand on the unit).
7. On occasion, a platform BIA device will produce an error if the subject’s
feet are dry. Adding some moisture to the feet can solve the problem.
Accuracy among BIA devices varies greatly. Most BIA machines use their
own equations that account for differences in water content and body density based on people’s gender, age, and race or ethnicity, as well as physical
activity levels. The variation for BIA is ±2.7 to 6.3% (Graves et al. 2006),
but this method can provide an accurate result when proper methods are
used. The subject must not have eaten or consumed a beverage within four
hours of the test, exercised within 12 hours of the test, or consumed alcohol
or diuretics prior to testing; in addition, the subject must have completely
voided the bladder within 30 minutes of the test and had minimal consump-


Body Composition

tion of diuretic agents such as chocolate or caffeine (American College of
Sports Medicine 2007). Dehydration can lead to overestimations in percent
body fat. Glycogen stores can affect impedance and can be a factor during
times of weight loss. If possible, BIA measurements should not be taken
before menstruation to avoid the possible effects of water retention.
Although BIA is a valid measure of body composition, percent body
fat is consistently overestimated for lean people and underestimated for
obese people. In athletes, BIA has been shown to significantly underestimate percent body fat when compared to hydrodensitometry (Dixon et al.
2005). Subject factors, technical skill, the prediction equation used, and the
instruments used all affect the accuracy of BIA. For best results, the same
BIA unit should be used for multiple testing points. Table 2.4 on page 38
provides percent body fat classifications.

Air Displacement Plethysmography
Body volume can be measured by air displacement rather than water
displacement. Air displacement plethysmography (ADP) offers several
advantages over other methods including safety. It is quick and comfortable and noninvasive, and it accommodates all people. However, a major
disadvantage is the cost of purchasing the ADP unit.
The BOD POD (a commercial ADP system) uses a dual-chamber (e.g.,
450 L subject test chamber, 300 L reference chamber) plethysmograph that
measures body volume via changes in air pressure within the closed twocompartment chamber. It includes an electronic weighing scale, computer,
and software system. The volume of air displaced is equal to body volume
and is calculated indirectly by subtracting the volume of air remaining in the
chamber when the subject is inside from the volume of air in the chamber
when it is empty.
Sources of error for ADP testing include variations in testing conditions,
the subject not being in a fasted state, air that is not accounted for in the
lungs or trapped within clothing and body hair, body moisture, and increased
body temperature. Reliability of ADP in adults is good and has been shown
to be valid in comparison to hydrodensitometry and dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA), which we discuss later.
ADP has been shown to produce similar (to DXA and hydrodensitometry)
percent fat measurements in collegiate female athletes (Ballard, Fafara,
and Vukovich 2004) and collegiate wrestlers (Dixon et al. 2005) and is an
effective assessment technique for monitoring changes in percent fat during
weight loss. However, some studies have shown that ADP overestimates
percent body fat in collegiate female athletes (Vescovi et al. 2002) and
underestimates percent body fat (by 2%) in collegiate American football
players (Collins et al. 1999).

Equipment
An ADP unit such as the BOD POD
Procedure
1. The subject’s information is entered in the BOD POD computer.
2. The BOD POD is calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. The subject is properly prepared. Similar to hydrodensitometry,
minimal clothing is worn. Swimsuits, compression shorts, sport bras,
and swim caps are recommended. Items such as jewelry and glasses
are removed. Percent fat may be underestimated by nearly 3% if a
swimming cap is not worn and hair covers a large portion of the face
(Higgins et al. 2001).
4. The subject’s mass is determined via the digital scale.
5. The subject enters the chamber and sits quietly during testing while
a minimum of two measurements (within 150 ml of each other) are
taken to determine body volume.
6. Thoracic gas volume is measured during normal breathing (i.e., via
the panting method, in which the subject breathes normally into a
tube connected within the chamber, followed by three small puffs
after the airway tube becomes momentarily occluded at the midpoint
of exhalation) or can be predicted via equations.
7. Corrected body volume (raw body volume – thoracic gas volume) is
calculated, body density is determined, and percent body fat is calculated using similar prediction equations to hydrodensitometry via the
system computer.

Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a body composition measurement tool that is increasing in popularity. In addition to percent body fat,
regional and total-body measures of bone mineral density, fat content, and
lean tissue mass are given. The principle of absorptiometry is based on the
exponential attenuation of X-rays at two energies as they pass through the
body. X-rays are generated at two energies via a low-current X-ray tube
located underneath the DXA machine. The differential attenuation is used
to estimate bone mineral content and soft tissue composition. A detector
positioned overhead on the scanning arm and a computer interface are
needed for scanning an image.
Equipment
DXA machine


Body Composition

Procedure
1. The DXA machine must first be calibrated (quality assurance) with a
calibration block; it is ready to use once all of the checks pass.
2. The subject’s information is entered into the software program.
3. The subject is prepared. Regular clothing may be worn, but everything
metallic must be removed. Shorts and a T-shirt will suffice.
4. The subject is placed supine on the scanning table and properly positioned. The body should be centered within the perimeter lines and
aligned with the central demarcation line. The head should be at least
2 inches (5 cm) from the top perimeter line to allow the scanning arm
a few blank cycles. Hands should be flat on the bed and may need to
be placed underneath the hips to fit within the perimeter. Legs should
be positioned in alignment with the central demarcation line (the line
should be between the legs) and braced at two levels with Velcro straps,
near the knees and at the feet, to minimize movement and allow the
subject to relax comfortably without moving. Large (tall and heavy)
people may have difficulty positioning their entire bodies within the
perimeter lines because the scanning bed is designed for people under
6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) and 300 pounds (136 kg). Muscular subjects
may also have difficulty fitting within the perimeter. In these cases,
the technician must position the subject as best as possible. DXA can
be uncomfortable for subjects who have to contract their muscles
to constrict their bodies. A different body composition tool (e.g.,
hydrodensitometry, BIA) may be better for large people despite the
loss of data.
5. The subject lies motionless on the bed as the test is initiated. Movement can cause irregularities on the scan.
6. The subject is scanned rectilinearly from head to toe for 5 to 25 minutes, depending on the type of scan and the person’s size. Newer DXA
units have greatly reduced total scan time making this procedure more
practical and easier to administer.
7. Upon completion of the scan, the technician needs to denote the
regions of interest (based on the manufacturer’s or standardized
guidelines) in the subject’s software file to obtain accurate regional
body composition information prior to analysis.
8. DXA reports give regional (head, trunk, limbs) and total-body bone
mass, lean tissue mass, and fat mass (and percent) data.
DXA has many advantages. It is easy to administer, fast, accurate, and
comfortable for most subjects; regional measurements are attractive for
many populations. In addition, a whole-body measurement produces less
than 5 μSv of radiation, which is much less than CT scans, chest X-rays,
and lumbar spine X-rays.

35


36

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

However, DXA does have some limitations. The scanning bed is not
designed for large people, and the machines (e.g., General Electric Lunar,
Hologic, and Norland) are large and expensive. In some areas, a physician’s
prescription may be needed for a DXA scan. DXA assumes a constant hydration state and electrolyte content in lean tissue, and hydration status could
affect the results. Body thickness problems may serve as a source of error,
and user error can occur when delineating regional measurements, thereby
demonstrating the importance of a single technician for sequential testing.
Lastly, the lack of standardization among DXA equipment manufacturers
poses a problem. Differences exist in hardware, calibration methodology,
imaging geometry (pencil versus fan-beam), and software, which result in
different body composition results among machines. Body fat measurements
have been shown to vary by approximately 1.7% when repeated measurements are taken on different DXA machines from the same manufacturer
(Tataranni, Pettitt, and Ravussin 1996), so it is important to use the same
machine for repeated testing.
DXA has been shown to correlate highly with hydrodensitometry and
other body composition measurements. However, DXA scans typically
register higher body fat percentages (i.e., 2 to 5%) for total-body measurements than other procedures do (Clasey et al. 1999; Kohrt 1998; Norcross
and Van Loan 2004). Although the results of most validation studies show
DXA to be an accurate tool for body composition measurement, limitations
preclude it from becoming a gold standard at the current time.

Computed Tomography Scans and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Cross-sectional imaging of the whole body can be viewed with computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These techniques produce scans that can noninvasively quantify tissue volume such
as regional fat distribution. Total-body composition analysis is possible with
sequential “slicing” through the body and assumptions for tissue densities. For CT scans, X-rays (ionizing radiation) pass through the subject and
create cross-sectional slices approximately 10 millimeters thick. The image
represents a 2-D map of pixels; each pixel has a numerical value (attenuation coefficient) that helps differentiate tissues based on the density and
electrons per unit mass.
For MRI scans, electromagnetic radiation excites and aligns hydrogen
atoms in water and fat molecules (via a magnet). Hydrogen protons then
absorb energy and generate an image. Fat and lean tissue can be quantified
by selecting regions of interest on the scan.
Both MRI and CT scans have been validated and are beneficial in that
they provide the opportunity to perform relative analyses of muscle, bone
density, and intra-abdominal fat. Because the use of radiation in CT scans


Body Composition

is a concern, however, they may only be viable for medical or research purposes. In addition, scanning is costly (especially MRI) making it impractical
for most people.

Near-Infrared Interactance
Near-infrared interactance (NIR) is based on principles of light absorption
and reflection using near-infrared spectroscopy. A light wand or fiber optic
probe is positioned perpendicularly on a body part (typically on the anterior midline surface of the biceps brachii), and infrared light is emitted at
specific wavelengths. The absorption of the infrared beam is measured via
a silicon-based detector that is expressed as two optical densities. Prediction equations estimate percent body fat via optical density, gender, height,
physical activity level, and body weight. Some commercial versions of NIR
(e.g., Futrex-5000, -5500, -6000, -6100) are portable and require minimal
technician training, making them attractive to the health and fitness industry. However, a major limitation is the small body sampling area.
NIR has been shown to be valid and reliable for determining the body
composition of female athletes (Fornetti et al. 1999), but it does produce
a higher error rate than other body composition procedures. NIR has been
shown to overpredict percent fat by up to 14.7% in young wrestlers (Housh
et al. 2004; Housh et al. 1996) and is least effective for monitoring body
composition changes following resistance and aerobic training (Broeder et
al. 1997). Thus, NIR is not recommended for routine use in healthy and
athletic populations.

Body Fat Standards
Interpretation of body fat percent estimates is complicated because all methods are indirect (error needs to be considered) and there are no universally
accepted standards for percent fat. Although national standards have been
developed in the United States and have been accepted for BMI and WHR,
none exist for percent fat estimates. Practitioners must choose from many
classifications proposed by various authors. Table 2.5 presents some general
percent fat classifications, although many other charts have been used.
A few points of emphasis need to be made. Human body fat may be categorized as essential or nonessential. Essential body fat fulfills several pertinent
functions in the body and is needed for good health. It is found throughout
the body but especially in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestines,
muscles, bone, and central nervous system (McArdle, Katch, and Katch 2007).
Essential body fat accounts for approximately 5% of body weight in males
and 12% in females (this difference accounts for gender-essential fat primarily resulting from hormonal differences and childbearing factors). If percent
fat falls below these levels, serious adverse health effects might ensue. This

37


38

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

can become an issue for athletes such as wrestlers or bodybuilders who may
keep their body fat levels low near competition time. Nonessential, or storage, body fat includes the subcutaneous adipose tissue as well as visceral fat
tissue. This type should be kept low for health and athletic purposes because
it contributes to the rest of the body fat percentage.

Comparison of Body Composition Techniques
Each body composition technique described has advantages and disadvantages, which are presented in table 2.4. The coach, practitioner, or athlete
must weigh the positives with the negatives when determining which technique to use. Ultimately, practicality may be the determining factor. Cost,
time, comfort, and accessibility are critical considerations when making
this decision, especially when several athletes will be tested on multiple
occasions.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Strength and conditioning professionals should include frequent body composition measurements in athletes’ general training macrocycles. Body composition measurements are easy to perform and are not fatiguing to the athlete
the way performance tests can be. Two major issues may be encountered.
The first is the cost of equipment. A few measurement tools are inexpensive,
whereas some technology may be cost prohibitive. For example, DEXA, MRI,
CT scans, and air displacement plethysmography units are expensive and may
be beyond the budget of many athletic programs. In addition, a facility that has
these technologies will typically have only one unit. Thus, testing a large group
of athletes could be very time consuming. Bioelectrical impedance units are
affordable and can be advantageous for testing athletes because they are quick
and portable, and multiple units can be purchased to permit the testing of large
groups of athletes in a short period of time. However, athletes’ hydration status
and activity level need to be carefully monitored prior to testing. Underwater
weighing may be an option (although it could be cost prohibitive for some programs) but generally takes longer and requires longer testing sessions because
only one athlete can be tested at a time. A period of familiarization is needed
so athletes understand the importance of expelling as much air as possible,
and some athletes may find holding their breath underwater uncomfortable.
The most practical solution for the strength and conditioning professional is
to develop a body composition measurement program based on body weight,
skinfold, and girth measurements. Body weight measurements require only a
scale, which is not cost prohibitive. These can be performed frequently including multiple times a day. This is especially important when monitoring athletes
who may be making weight (i.e., wrestlers and other athletes in combat sports)
or monitoring hydration status, such as when weighing American football players before, during, and after practice in hot, humid conditions to quantify fluid
weight loss. Skinfold calipers are relatively inexpensive, and multiple calipers
can be purchased, which makes testing large groups of athletes in a short
period of time easy. Population-specific equations (or tables) can be used for
quick body fat percentage calculations. Using a spreadsheet to calculate the
data increases the speed of testing; an assistant can immediately input data,
obtain a fat percentage, and give the athlete rapid feedback. Tape measures
can be purchased at low prices and are very useful for girth measurements.
Girth measurements can also be useful for indirectly assessing muscle hypertrophy from a resistance training program. Thus, the strength and conditioning
professional can be well equipped economically for large-scale body composition testing by having one or more accurate scales, skinfold calipers (preferably
Lange), and tape measures (preferably Gulick tape measures because tension
can be standardized) at their facilities.
The second issue facing the strength and conditioning professional is homogeneity of the testing staff and procedures. Because a large number of athletes
may need to be tested, multiple staff members or personnel may be performing
the tests. It is very important that technique be standardized among the staff.


Body Composition

In fact, one coach or assistant should be assigned to each athlete for consistent and accurate data acquisition. For example, with skinfold analysis two
practitioners’ techniques may be slightly different yielding two different values
for the athlete. In this case, the body fat difference is due to tester error rather
than physiological changes.
Calibration sessions for single athletes can be helpful. In such sessions, multiple testers perform the skinfold analysis on the same athlete, and the results
are compared. Consistent results from staff members confirm data consistency.
However, because athletes with more body fat have more variation, calibration
sessions are most productive when small, medium, and large athletes are
examined. This gives good practice to those learning proper technique. Thus,
multiple athletes can be used as subjects, but the results must be compared
among the same individual athletes. That is, athletes A, B, and C are tested,
but testers compare results for A to calibrate technique, then compare results
for B, and subsequently compare results for C. If the data vary glaringly, the
staff must alter the technique to produce greater consistency.
With girth measurements, a slight variation in the location of the tape measure or a difference in tension applied to the tape measure can yield variable
results. Body weight measurements, on the other hand, are standard provided
the scale is functioning properly.
The head strength and conditioning coach must ensure that the staff uses
consistent techniques. The most accurate system is to assign certain staff
members to certain athletes. This standardizes the procedures per athlete and
provides more accurate measurements of body composition over time.

Excess body fat is detrimental to health and performance, so measurement of body composition is of great importance for health professionals, fitness practitioners, athletes, and coaches.
Several methods exist to indirectly measure body composition. Simple
methods such as girth measurements, BMI, and skinfolds can be
performed with little equipment and at low cost, and are fast and
easy to perform, which is advantageous when testing large numbers
of people over time.
BIA is another simple body composition tool that can be attractive for
use with athletic populations. However, equipment is more costly than
that for skinfold and girth measurements, and BIA is prone to error.
Advanced body composition estimates (hydrodensitometry, ADP,
DXA, CT, and MRI) can be made when specific information is needed,
equipment is available, and trained technicians perform the procedures. These methods are less practical for many athletes, but show
greater accuracy, reliability, and validity than simpler methods.
