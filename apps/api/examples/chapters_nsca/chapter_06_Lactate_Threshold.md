Lactate Threshold
Dave Morris, PhD

Lactate is a metabolite that can be produced by the breakdown of glucose
or glycogen during the process of glycolysis. Although numerous cells and
tissues use glycolysis and produce lactate, the biggest producer during exercise is skeletal muscle, which relies on the glycolytic pathway to provide
energy for contractions.
Historically, lactate has been thought of as a waste product of carbohydrate
metabolism. In actuality, some amount of the lactate that is produced by
the working muscle can be retained by that muscle and used as an energy
metabolite. The remaining lactate that is not burned in the working muscle
diffuses into the blood where its levels can be measured by a variety of
techniques. One such measurement strategy, the lactate threshold test,
involves having a subject perform an exercise bout that features progressively higher rates of work. At regular time intervals during the test, blood
samples are drawn and analyzed for lactate concentration.
Through the use of the lactate threshold test, researchers have discovered
that during low-intensity exercise, blood lactate remains at fairly low and
stable levels. However, as exercise becomes more intense, blood lactate
levels eventually begin to rise suddenly and continue to rise exponentially
as exercise intensity increases. This sudden and distinct rise in blood lactate
levels is commonly referred to as lactate threshold.
Because of lactate’s role in exercise metabolism, scientists have studied
its response to exercise to gain insight into the nuances of bioenergetics.
Lactate’s link to energy provision during exercise has sparked interest from
coaches and athletes looking to design and execute better training programs.

Energy Pathways and Lactate Metabolism
Properly designing, administering, and interpreting a lactate threshold
test requires a comprehensive knowledge of energy pathways and lactate
metabolism. As mentioned, lactate can be produced when glycolysis is used
to supply energy to the working muscle.
The activation of glycolysis does not always mean that lactate production
or blood lactate accumulation will occur in significant amounts. During
low- to moderate-intensity exercise (below a rating of perceived exertion
of approximately 12 to 13 on the Borg scale), the oxidative energy pathway
can provide adequate energy to meet the needs of the working muscle. As
exercise intensity increases, the energy demand can begin to overwhelm
the capacity of the oxidative energy pathways, forcing the body to rely
more heavily on glycolysis to supply adequate energy to fuel muscular
contractions. During these times of high energy demand, and high rates
of glycolysis, considerable lactate production and accumulation can occur.
Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that can be activated very quickly. It
occurs in the cytosol of the muscle cell and consumes glucose-6-phosphate,
using this substrate to produce four molecules that are essential for energy
metabolism: adenosine triphosphate (ATP), NADH + H+, pyruvate, and
lactate.
The importance of ATP to exercise metabolism is elementary, because
the energy held in the phosphate bonds of this molecule provide the free
energy needed for performing muscular contractions. Chemical reactions
must take place to break these bonds in order for the energy to be released.
Once the energy is released, it can be harnessed and utilized for muscular
contractions. Because glycolysis can produce ATP very quickly, the body calls
on it to provide substantial amounts of ATP during brief exercise bouts (30
seconds to 1 minute). Additionally, glycolysis becomes very active during
extended high-intensity bouts of exercise when ATP demand is greater than
can be met by oxidative phosphorylation.
Glycolytic ATP formation occurs at two points: the phosphoglycerate
kinase and pyruvate kinase reactions. Two molecules of ATP are produced
from each reaction, and two or three molecules are produced from glycolysis
for each glucose-6-phosphate molecule that is consumed. The discrepancy
in the net ATP yield depends on the source of the glucose-6-phosphate that
is being used. If blood glucose is being used to form glucose-6-phosphate,
two ATP molecules must be invested, one at the hexokinase reaction and
one at the phosphofructokinase reaction, for glycolysis to be completed.
Therefore, two ATP molecules are harvested when blood glucose is used
as the source for glucose-6-phosphate. If muscle glycogen is the source of
the glucose-6-phosphate, the hexokinase reaction is skipped, requiring the
investment of one less ATP molecule and a higher net ATP yield.
NADH + H+ is formed from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, at
the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. As noted in figure

6.1, this oxidation-reduction reaction transfers a hydrogen from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to NAD, forming NADH. The associated hydrogen of the
NADH + H+ comes from a free hydrogen ion in the cytosol. Its association
to NADH is due to the attraction of the positively charged hydrogen ion to
a negatively charged electron on the nicotinamide molecule.
There are two important aspects of glycolytic NADH + H+ production to
exercise metabolism. First, the NADH + H+ formed during glycolysis can
donate its hydrogens to NAD and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) in the
mitochondria to form mitochondrial NADH + H+ and FADH2. These newly

127


128

formed mitochondrial NADH + H+ or FADH2 are then used in the electron
transport chain to regenerate large amounts of ATP. Second, the formation
of NADH + H+ at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase allows
for the formation of 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate, whose phosphate groups are
subsequently used to regenerate ATP at the phosphoglycerate kinase and
pyruvate kinase reactions.
The formation of pyruvate occurs in one of the two possible final reactions
of glycolysis. Once formed in the muscle cell, pyruvate typically has two
fates: conversion to lactate, which will be discussed later in the chapter, or
transfer into the mitochondria where it can be consumed by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Once in the mitochondria, pyruvate combines with
coenzyme A to form acetyl coA. This process involves a series of reactions
that also produces NADH + H+, which, like the NADH + H+ produced by
glycolysis, can be used by the electron transport chain to regenerate ATP.
The newly created acetyl coA enters the TCA cycle where it is used to produce ATP, NADH + H+, and FADH2; the latter two molecules are used to
regenerate ATP in the electron transport chain.
The final ATP tally from one molecule of glucose being consumed through
glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the electron transport chain is approximately
36 to 39 ATP. This number will vary slightly depending on the source of
glucose-6-phosphate, the method of transferring the NADH + H+ made in
the cytosol to the mitochondria, and the efficiency of the coupling of oxidation and phosphorylation in the electron transport chain.
A second fate of pyruvate is its conversion to lactate. Lactate is formed
from pyruvate by the donation of hydrogen ions from the NADH + H+ created by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. Once
formed in the muscle cell, lactate has two immediate fates. Under some
circumstances, this lactate can be converted back into pyruvate and used as
a fuel in the oxidative pathways. Lactate that is not used to reform pyruvate
is transported out of the muscle to other tissues and used for a variety of
purposes. In contrast to pyruvate, lactate itself cannot be consumed by the
TCA cycle; thus, lactate that is not used to reform pyruvate cannot be immediately used to further contribute to ATP production. Lactate that appears
in the blood therefore represents an ATP yield from glucose-6-phosphate
that is limited to the two or three ATP molecules that are produced during
glycolysis.
With its superior ATP yield, the consumption of pyruvate by the TCA cycle
is obviously the preferred method of pyruvate metabolism during steady
state exercise. However, the mitochondria are limited in their ability to produce ATP from pyruvate; and as exercise intensity increases, increased ATP
demands must be met, somewhat, by an increase in the rate of glycolysis.
However, glycolysis has its own self-limiting mechanism that tempers its
ability to produce ATP.
Glycolysis must have adequate levels of NAD to produce NADH + H+ at
the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate reaction. Despite the usefulness of NADH


Lactate Threshold

+ HNADH + H+ in ATP regeneration in the electron transport chain, largescale production of NADH + H+ by glycolysis can lead to a drop in NAD
levels in the cytosol. During moderate-intensity exercise, the mitochondria
are able to maintain stable levels of NAD in the cytosol by consuming the
hydrogens from NADH + H+. However, increases in the rate of glycolysis
during heavy exercise can produce NADH + H+ in amounts large enough
to overwhelm the consumption capacity of the mitochondria, leading to
a buildup of NADH + HNADH + H+ and a drop in the levels of NAD. If the
levels of NAD continue to decline, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) reaction will slow as a result of a lack of NAD. The
reduction in the G3PDH reaction will result in lowered rates of glycolysis
and glycolytic ATP production and fatigue in the exercising person.
During high-intensity exercise, the formation of lactate plays key roles
in exercise metabolism, ATP production, and the maintenance of exercising
work rates. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate consumes the hydrogen
ions associated with NADH + HNADH + H+, which has two benefits: the
regeneration of NAD, which allows glycolysis and glycolytic ATP production to continue at high rates, and the maintenance of relatively neutral pH
during exercise (for a comprehensive review, see Robergs, Ghiasvand, and
Parker 2004). These benefits of lactate formation are in stark contrast to
the traditional beliefs that lactate formation promotes acidosis and fatigue
during high-intensity exercise. On the contrary, the formation of lactate
actually helps to sustain high-intensity exercise by reducing acidosis and
maintaining adequate supplies of NAD.
The production of large amounts of lactate does, however, indicate that
the body is using its last line of defense to maintain glycolytic ATP production and exercise intensity. Once this point is reached, further increases in
work rates will eventually overwhelm the capacity of lactate production,
resulting in acidosis, a drop in NAD levels, and fatigue. Thus, although lactate accumulation and fatigue during exercise are highly correlated, lactate
should not be considered a cause of fatigue.
Although lactate is generally associated with high-intensity exercise,
some amounts are always being produced regardless of exercising work
rates. As exercise intensity increases, accumulation of NADH + HNADH +
H+ and pyruvate can cause large increases in the rate of lactate production.
Once formed in the working muscle, lactate that is not metabolized locally
is transported through the cell membrane and into the blood where it can
be delivered to, and consumed by, a variety of tissues.
The lactate dehydrogenase reaction that forms lactate from pyruvate is
reversible and allows a variety of tissues including cardiac and nonworking
skeletal muscle to use the arriving lactate as a source of pyruvate for the
TCA cycle. This process allows these tissues to provide substrate for oxidative metabolism without using their glycogen stores or importing glucose
from the blood. Lactate can also be absorbed by the liver where, through
the process of gluconeogenesis, it can be converted back into glucose and

129


130

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

released into the bloodstream for the working muscle to use. This transport
of lactate from the working muscle to the liver, its conversion into glucose,
and its redistribution to the working muscle is a process known as the Cori
cycle.
Regardless of the fate of lactate, its levels in the blood are a product of
lactate production versus lactate consumption. At relatively low to moderate exercise intensities, lactate consumption equals lactate production,
resulting in blood lactate levels that are relatively low and consistent. As
exercise intensities continue to rise, however, increased rates of glycolysis
eventually result in lactate production rates that overwhelm the lactate consumption rate. If high-intensity exercise continues, this inequity ultimately
causes an increase in blood lactate concentrations—the lactate threshold
(see figure 6.2).

Sport Performance and Lactate Threshold
The objective of a lactate threshold test is to identify the exercise intensity
at which the body relies heavily on glycolysis and, consequently, produces
excessive amounts of lactate to meet energy demand. Because a lactate
threshold test focuses on the ability to use aerobic energy pathways, it is
used almost exclusively for endurance athletes such as marathon runners
and long-distance cyclists. It identifies the work rate at which the athlete
starts to rely more heavily on the inefficient catabolism of the body’s limited
carbohydrate stores. An athlete with a relatively high lactate threshold is
better able to preserve carbohydrate stores when working at high intensities.

Performing a Lactate Threshold Test
During a lactate threshold test, subjects exercise at progressively higher work
rates until they are at or near exhaustion. Blood samples are taken at regular
time intervals throughout the test and analyzed for lactate concentration.
The test begins at a relatively low work rate and progresses slowly so that
blood lactate levels remain at, or near, resting levels throughout the early
stages of the test. The work rate increases such that a lactate threshold is
reached after approximately 12 to 20 minutes of exercise. This strategy
of gradually increasing the workload from a low-intensity starting point
establishes an exercising baseline level of blood lactate that is useful in
identifying the point at which blood lactate accumulation begins.
A variety of exercising modes can be used to perform a lactate threshold
test; treadmill running and cycling ergometry are two of the most popular.
Although practically any exercise mode is suitable for testing non-endurance-trained athletes, endurance-trained athletes should be tested using
the type of exercise that most closely resembles their competitive events.
This strategy allows the athlete to perform the test using a familiar mode

of exercise and provides data that are useful in both the design and the
assessment of a training program.

Pretest Considerations
Prior to the start of a lactate threshold test, the subject should perform an
adequate warm-up of approximately 10 to 15 minutes beginning at a low
work rate and progressing to a terminal intensity that is similar to the starting
work rate for the lactate threshold test. The warm-up serves two purposes:
The oxidative energy pathways need several minutes to reach optimal
operating capacity. Early in exercise, the body relies heavily on glycolysis
■■

131


132

to meet ATP demand, resulting in high levels of lactate production. This
increased rate of lactate production could lead to blood lactate levels in the
initial stages of the test that may not accurately reflect the blood lactate
production and consumption dynamics when mitochondria are functioning
at their optimal levels.
■■
People who have never had a lactate threshold test may be apprehensive or nervous before the test begins. These feelings may result in a
rise in circulating levels of epinephrine, which can cause increased rates
of glycolysis and lactate production. In fact, epinephrine is such a potent
stimulator of lactate production that anxious, but otherwise resting, subjects can exhibit blood lactate levels similar to those undergoing intense
exercise. These uncharacteristically high levels of blood lactate can make
it more difficult to determine the point at which lactate production begins
to accelerate as a result of increases in work rate, leading to an inaccurate
assessment of lactate threshold. By performing a warm-up prior to the start
of the lactate threshold test, subjects can reduce anxiousness and their rates
of lactate production, leading to more accurate lactate levels during the
early portion of the test.
Starting work rates and the progression of the work rates over the course
of the test are dictated by the ability of the subject. Care should be taken
when establishing these values to ensure that the subject reaches lactate
threshold within approximately 12 to 20 minutes. A test that starts at too
high of a work rate or progresses too quickly may not allow the subject
to establish an exercising baseline, making identification of the lactate
threshold difficult or impossible. A test that starts too low or progresses too
slowly wastes both time and materials. Current training paces and previous lactate threshold results can be useful in determining proper starting
work rates. If the subject has no prior exercise experience, it is best to err
on the conservative side; otherwise, the examiner runs the risk of having to
repeat the test because the starting work rate exceeded the subject’s lactate
threshold work rate or the examiner did not allow for the establishment
of an exercise baseline.

Administering the Test
Once the test begins, the progression of the work rate can be accomplished
by continuously increasing the work rate over time, which is commonly
known as a ramp protocol. The step protocol involves increasing the work
rate by a specified amount at consistent intervals, usually every three to
four minutes. Ramp protocols can be popular for some types of research
applications, but step protocols are generally more useful when evaluating
athletes because they determine more precisely the power output or pace
that actually elicits the lactate threshold. In a step protocol, work rates
typically increase at each stage by approximately 5 to 15% of the starting
work rate for the test, whereas the ramp protocol uses similar increases in

at regular time intervals and analyzed for lactate concentration. If a
ramp protocol is used, blood is typically drawn at varied time intervals. Early
in the test, blood samples are usually drawn every three or four minutes.
As the subject nears lactate threshold, sampling occurs more frequently,
usually every 30 seconds to 1 minute. The more frequent blood samples
taken near the lactate threshold allow for a more accurate determination
of the occurrence of the lactate threshold. Because the work rates remain
stable during each stage of a step protocol, the blood is drawn at constant
time intervals, generally during the final 30 seconds of each stage.
Taking blood samples too early in the stage may result in lactate readings that do not accurately reflect the lactate production rate for a particular workload. This is because the energy pathways must be given time to
increase their rate of operation in response to higher work rates. Furthermore, once glycolytic rates and lactate production rates stabilize in response
to the new workload, the lactate must be given time to migrate to the blood
and become evenly distributed throughout the bloodstream. Only at that
point will lactate levels accurately reflect the levels of lactate production.
Blood samples can be obtained from numerous sites on the body; the
three most popular are the fingertips, earlobes, and an antecubital vein.
Fingertip and earlobe samples are typically obtained by making a small
puncture wound in the skin through which small (approximately 50 μL)
samples can be obtained for analysis. Fingertip and earlobe sampling has
gained popularity in recent years because it is minimally invasive and
modern lactate analyzers require only very small (25 to 50 μL) volumes
for analysis. Certain methods of blood lactate analysis, such as spectrophotometry, require larger samples than can be obtained from the earlobe or
fingertip. In these cases, blood is typically drawn from an antecubital vein
using a catheter or venipuncture technique.
The blood sampling site may be dictated by the equipment available, but
is otherwise up to the technician and subject. It should be noted that blood
lactate levels can vary by 50% or more depending on the sampling site

(El-Sayed, George, and Dyson 1993); thus, once a sampling site is chosen,
it should be used consistently throughout the test.
Once the blood sample is obtained, it should be analyzed with a lactate
analyzer immediately. If this is not possible, the sample should be placed in
a lysing agent to destroy the red blood cells as quickly as possible because
they produce lactate as part of their normal metabolism. If left intact, red
blood cells will continue to produce lactate after the blood sample has been
obtained resulting in blood lactate levels that are not reflective of lactate
production by the working muscle.

Test Termination and Data Analyses
The lactate threshold test continues until the subject reaches exhaustion, or
until a clear and continued rise in blood lactate concentration is observed.
Once blood lactate data have been obtained, lactate threshold is determined
by plotting the lactate values against their respective work rates. As shown
in figure 6.2, blood lactates at lower work rates are typically maintained
at fairly low and consistent levels. This maintenance of consistent lactate
concentration in the face of increasing work rates is commonly referred to
as a baseline, or as baseline lactate values.
As work rates exceed a certain level, blood lactate levels begin to exhibit
substantial increases as work rates increase. This inflection point in blood
lactate concentration is considered by many to be the lactate threshold,
which can often be identified by visually inspecting the plotted lactate values
for changes in lactate concentrations in response to increases in work rate
(Davis et al. 2007).
Unfortunately, lactate plots may not always exhibit a clear and decisive
threshold such as the one shown in figure 6.2. Figure 6.4 illustrates data
from a subject who exhibited a gradual rise in blood lactate levels; in this

case, no definitive lactate threshold could be determined using the visual
inspection method. Because such cases occur with regularity, many exercise
physiologists advocate the use of more objective methods of determining
lactate threshold. These methods include the 0.5 mmol ∙ L–1 criteria, the
1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 criteria, the extrapolation method, and the D-max method.

0.5 and 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 Criteria
The 0.5 (Zoladz, Rademaker, and Sargeant 1995) and 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 (Thoden
1991) criteria use similar methods for identifying lactate threshold, but
differ in the magnitude of the change required to qualify as a threshold.
With these methods, blood lactate concentrations are plotted against their
respective work rates. The lactate threshold is then identified as the highest
work rate that does not result in a 0.5 or 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 increase in blood
lactate concentration in response to at least two consecutive increases in
work rate. The requirement of two consecutive increases in blood lactate
reduces the possibility of erroneously identifying a lactate threshold from
irregular lactate responses to low exercising work rates.
In figure 6.5, the blood lactate values stayed relatively low and stable
through 250 watts. At a work rate of 275 watts, the lactate value increased
by greater than 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1. This 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 increase was again seen
between the 275- and 300-watt outputs, which meets the requirement of
a 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 increase in blood lactate concentration in response to at
least two consecutive increases in work rate.
A major limitation of the visual inspection and 0.5 and 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1
methods of determining lactate threshold is that the accuracy of the threshold measurement is somewhat dictated by the work rate increments of the
stages. For instance, in figure 6.2, the lactate threshold is clearly 250 watts.

and extrapolated downward until it intersects with the x-axis. The point of intersection on
the x-axis marks the work rate at E4846/NSCA/421857/6.6/JG/R2
which lactate threshold supposedly occurs.

However, because lactate levels were measured only at 250 watts and 275
watts, we can only be certain that blood lactate was not accumulating at
250 watts, but was accumulating at 275 watts. Thus, we cannot be certain
of the precise work rate that causes blood lactate to accumulate, only that
it is somewhere between just above 250 watts and 275 watts.

Regression Analyses
In an attempt to make more precise assessments of the work rates that
induce lactate threshold, some exercise physiologists advocate using regression analyses to analyze blood lactate data. To perform this procedure, the
lactate curve is divided into two parts: baseline, which includes all of those
lactate values up to the point at which blood lactate levels begin to rise,
and the exponential portion of the curve, which includes all values from
this inflection point until the termination of the test. Separate regression
analyses are performed on each portion of the curve to generate lines of
best fit for the respective portions. Once established, the regression lines
are extrapolated until they intersect. A vertical line is passed through the
point of intersection and extrapolated downward until it intersects with
the x-axis. The point of intersection on the x-axis marks the work rate at
which lactate threshold supposedly occurs (see figure 6.6).
A criticism of the extrapolation method is that lactate threshold is influenced by the rate at which blood lactate concentrations increase following
the exhibition of a lactate inflection point. Consider two athletes whose
lactate profiles are presented in figure 6.7, a and b. Athlete A’s blood lactate
accumulated at a much quicker rate after the exhibition of a lactate inflection point than did athlete B’s. Note that by virtue of the interaction of the
two regression lines, athlete A has a higher lactate threshold than athlete B,
even though their lactate inflection points occurred at the same work rate.

even though their lactate inflection points occurred at
the same work rate.

Factors that dictate this rate of increase in blood lactate levels following the exhibition of an inflection point, such as the activity of the lactate
dehydrogenase enzyme, muscle fiber composition, and blood volume, may
have nothing to do with the work rate that actually results in the accumulation of blood lactate. Thus, determination of the lactate threshold by the
extrapolation method may be unjustifiably influenced by factors that do
not result in an initial increase in blood lactate levels.

D-Max Method
To perform the D-max method of lactate analysis, the subject must exercise
to volitional exhaustion during the lactate threshold test (Cheng et al. 1992).
The resulting data are plotted using a third-order curvilinear regression.
Next, a straight line is drawn connecting the first and last lactate values. A
second line is drawn perpendicularly from the first line to the point on the

line is drawn downward until it intersects with the x-axis. The work rate
that elicits lactate threshold is said to be at the point at which the third line
intersects with the x-axis (see figure 6.8).
Although the D-max method suffers from the same criticism as the
extrapolation method, a high degree of repeatability has been reported for
this approach (Zhou and Weston 1997). Furthermore, in a comparison of
10K running pace to pace at lactate threshold determined by a number of
methods, the D-max method predicted competitive running performance
with the greatest degree of accuracy (Nicholson and Sleivert 2001), demonstrating the method’s usefulness for evaluating competitive athletes.

Maximal Lactate Steady State
Although lactate threshold is probably the most commonly used lactate
measurement test, the maximal lactate steady state test (MLSS) is sometimes used to predict maximal sustainable work rates in exercising people.
This test monitors blood lactate levels during extended periods of consistent
exercise intensity seeking to identify the highest workload at which blood
lactate levels remain stable (Beneke 2003).
The maximal lactate steady state concept was born from criticism that,
although lactate threshold marks the point of increased blood lactate accumulation, it may not identify the highest work rate a person can maintain
without continued increases in lactate production when this intensity is
maintained over an extended period of time. Increases in lactate production and blood lactate levels are sometimes mistakenly considered to be an
indication that the body is unable to maintain homeostasis in the glycolytic
pathway. In fact, lactate production assists in the maintenance of proper rates

of ATP production by maintaining adequate levels of NAD for glycolysis.
Some have demonstrated that work rates in excess of those that result in
lactate threshold can be maintained with consistent, albeit elevated, levels
of lactate production in many people (Morris and Shafer 2010). Proponents
of MLSS argue that, even though the lactate levels in response to a given
workload are higher than exercising baseline, their consistent levels over
time indicate that homeostasis within glycolysis is occurring and exercise
intensity can be maintained for an extended period of time. Thus, the
MLSS test monitors the blood lactate response to a specific work rate over
an extended period of time.
Determination of MLSS involves a series of tests and may take several
days to complete. Initially, the subject should perform a lactate threshold
test as described earlier in this chapter. From this data, the work rate that
elicits lactate threshold is identified. The subject then performs a series of
discontinuous exercise stages separated by several minutes or hours of
rest. The durations of the stages vary considerably by protocol and usually range from 9 to 30 minutes (Beneke 2003). The work rates are held
at a constant level within each stage while blood is drawn at regular time
intervals and analyzed for lactate levels. If the subject maintains consistent
blood lactate levels throughout a stage, a rest period is provided and the
procedure is repeated at a slightly higher work rate. This strategy continues
until significant increases in blood lactate levels are observed within a single
stage. MLSS is defined as the highest work rate that does not result in an
increase in blood lactate concentration exceeding the criteria for steady
state lactate levels.
Figure 6.9 illustrates lactate values from two consecutive stages of an
MLSS test. At 250 watts (see figure 6.9a), the subject was able to maintain
a consistent blood lactate level throughout the duration of the stage. During
the next stage, when the work rate was increased to 260 watts, the lactate

values did not remain at a consistent level and increased over the duration
of the stage (see figure 6.9b). From these data, we can determine that MLSS
is 250 watts for this subject.
The duration of the stages and rest periods, the progression in work rates
between stages, and the criteria for a rise in blood lactate vary considerably
depending on the mode of exercise and the specific protocol. For instance,
in protocols using 30-minute stages, blood lactate levels may be measured
every 5 minutes and lactate increases may be limited to no more than 1.0
mmol ∙ L–1 between the 10th and 30th minutes of exercise (Beneke 2003);
whereas others may limit increases to no more than 0.5 mmol ∙ L–1 between
the 20th and 30th minutes (Urhausen et al. 1993). Shorter protocol, such
as 9 minutes, may measure blood lactate every 3 minutes and limit blood
lactate increase to no more than 1.0 mmol ∙ L–1 between the 3rd and 9th
minutes (Morris, Kearney, and Burke 2000).
Rest periods between stages may vary between 30 minutes for the shorter
staged protocols and 24 hours for the protocols using 30-minute stages.
When evaluating athletes for training purposes, the shorter protocols are
more appropriate because athletes typically do not have time to devote to
the multiple days of testing required for the longer MLSS protocols. However, more accurate determinations of MLSS may be obtained from longer
protocols, which may make them more appealing to researchers.
The work rate for the initial stage is usually slightly above the work rate
at lactate threshold. Work rate progressions can be arbitrarily set or calculated as a percentage of the work rate for the initial stage. For rowing and
cycling protocols, common increments are 5 to 10 watts, whereas runners
may increase by 0.2 to 0.3 miles per hour (0.3 to 0.5 km/h) per stage.

Using Lactate Threshold Data
Information provided by a lactate threshold test has a number of purposes.
By understanding the role that lactate plays in exercise metabolism, the
exercise physiologist can use the information from lactate threshold tests
to predict proper racing and training paces, and assess the fitness of a subject or the efficacy of the training program. Although lactate production
does not contribute to acidosis and lactate itself does not appear to cause
fatigue, blood lactate accumulation does indicate that the body is relying
on substantial contributions from anaerobic glycolysis to meet exercising
energy requirements. Knowing the exercise intensity at which this occurs
is valuable for two reasons: When glucose and glycogen are metabolized
to lactate, only two or three ATP molecules are generated per molecule of
carbohydrate consumed compared to the 36 to 39 ATP molecules that are
generated when pyruvate is produced and consumed through oxidative
phosphorylation. Thus, the advent of lactate threshold signals that the body
is consuming glucose and glycogen at an increased rate in respect to ATP


Lactate Threshold

production, which, ultimately, can lead to premature carbohydrate depletion
and exhaustion. Therefore, athletes who partake in events that challenge
their glycogen storage capacity should take into consideration the need to
preserve carbohydrate stores when planning their pacing strategies.
Increases in blood lactate concentrations also indicate that the subject’s
ATP consumption rate is beginning to exceed the ability to provide ATP
through the oxidative pathway. The increase in blood lactate levels seen at
this transitional intensity indicates that the body has to rely on glycolysis
to provide adequate ATP supplies for the exercising muscle. Though lactate
production does not result in acidosis and has a questionable role in causing fatigue, the accumulation of lactate in the blood indicates that maximal
sustainable rates of exercise and ATP production are close at hand (Morris
and Shafer 2010).
The relationship between lactate threshold and the rate of consumption
of carbohydrate stores, and correlations between lactate threshold and
maximal sustainable work rate, make lactate threshold a good predictor
of endurance exercise performance. Previous studies (Foxdal et al. 1994;
Tanaka 1990) have demonstrated close agreements between running paces
at lactate threshold and average paces during competitive running events
in distances ranging from 10,000 meters to the marathon. In studies using
cycling ergometry, power outputs that elicited lactate threshold were similar
to average power outputs during time trials ranging from 60 to 90 minutes
(Bentley et al. 2001; Bishop, Jenkins, and Mackinnon 1998). However, in
time trials ranging from 25 to 35 minutes, subjects typically maintain significantly higher power outputs than those that elicited lactate threshold
(Bentley et al. 2001; Kenefick et al. 2002). Despite these discrepancies, correlations between power outputs at lactate threshold and average power
outputs during the shorter time trials remained remarkably high, suggesting
that performance in these events can be predicted from lactate threshold
data with reasonable accuracy.
As in many physiological and anatomical systems, the mechanisms that
influence lactate threshold are responsive to exercise training. Properly
designed training programs can increase the capacity of the oxidative pathway
by increasing oxygen delivery to the working muscle (Schmidt et al. 1988),
mitochondrial numbers (Holloszy and Coyle 1984), and oxidative enzyme
levels (Henriksson and Reitman 1976). These improvements in oxidative
capacity increase the muscle’s ability to produce ATP, consume pyruvate, and
regenerate NAD resulting in a reduced reliance on lactate production and an
increase in work rates that are required to elicit lactate threshold.
Unlike maximal oxygen consumption, which can be significantly influenced by genetic factors (Bouchard et al. 1986), the exhibition of lactate
threshold when expressed as a percentage of maximal oxygen consumption is primarily influenced by the level of conditioning (Henritze et al.
1985). This sensitivity to exercise training makes lactate threshold useful for
assessing aerobic fitness and the efficacy of training programs. Well-trained

The lactate threshold training effect.

endurance athletes tend to exhibit lactate threshold when exercising at
80% or more of their maximal oxygen consumption, whereas untrained
people experience lactate threshold at substantially lower intensities (Joyner
and Coyle 2008). Continued training at or above the work rate that elicits
lactate threshold also results in increases in the power outputs that cause
increased rates of lactate production and accumulation (Henritze et al. 1985).
Therefore, the efficacy of a training program can be assessed by measuring lactate threshold prior to, and following, program implementation. A
rightward shift, as seen in figure 6.10, suggests that the training program
has been successful in increasing the work rate that elicits lactate threshold
and maximal sustainable work rates.
The ability of lactate threshold to respond to training and predict competitive performance also makes it useful in prescribing proper training
intensities. Scientific evidence supports the overload principle of training (Weltman et al. 1992), which suggests that the most effective way to
improve physiological capacity is to train at an intensity that exceeds current ability. Thus, effective training strategies involve assessing athletes’
current performance capacities and using work intervals that exceed their
current maximal sustainable work rates. Undoubtedly, the most accurate
way of measuring an athlete’s performance capacity in a particular event is
to measure performance during that event. Unfortunately, lengthy endurance events such as the marathon are physically taxing, which makes performing them simply to test performance capacity impractical. However,
the relatively short and low-stress nature of a lactate threshold test makes
it ideal for frequently assessing an athlete’s ability.

Professional Applications

Tim is a competitive distance runner who has recently set a goal of running
his first marathon. He has a history of strong performances in 10K road races
and wants to run a fast time in his first marathon. Tim recognizes the concept
of progressive overload and knows that to improve his ability in the marathon,
he must train at a pace that is faster than the speed he could maintain for the
entire 26.2 miles. However, if he trains at a pace that is too fast, he won’t be
able to do the volume of training that is required to perform well in his upcoming competition. He is very aware of his abilities at the 10K distance, but the
marathon is roughly four times longer than the 10K, and he knows that he
cannot maintain this pace for the entire marathon.
Tim visits an exercise physiologist, who is also a distance runner, for advice.
The exercise physiologist agrees that Tim’s competitive pace for the 10K is
far faster than what he could maintain for the entire marathon. The exercise
physiologist is aware of research demonstrating that pace at lactate threshold
is typically very similar to the pace that can be maintained for a marathon and
suggests that Tim undergo a lactate threshold test.
The exercise physiologist chooses a step protocol because it will identify the
running pace that elicits lactate threshold more accurately than a ramp protocol.
Stages for the test will be three minutes long to stabilize blood lactate levels
in response to each new workload. The pace of each stage will increase by
one-half mile per hour to determine the pace that results in lactate threshold.
The starting pace must be one that will allow Tim to complete four or five
stages before blood lactate levels begin to rise. This will establish a baseline
from which to identify lactate threshold. Tim has recently competed in a 10K
run, finishing in 36:00, which roughly translates into a six-minute mile, or a pace
of about 10 miles per hour. Well-conditioned endurance runners can maintain a
pace for a 10K race that is slightly faster than their pace at lactate threshold.
Thus, 9.5 miles per hour is a good estimation for a pace that will elicit lactate
threshold. To start the test at a speed that will put Tim at 9.5 miles per hour
within four stages, the exercise physiologist multiplies the number of stages
(four) by the rate of increase in speed for each stage (0.5 mph). The resulting
figure of 2 miles per hour is then subtracted from the suspected lactate threshold speed of 9.5 miles per hour to give a starting speed of 7.5 miles per hour.
Prior to starting the test, Tim warms up for 12 minutes. The warm-up begins
at a relatively slow speed of five miles per hour and remains here for the first
two minutes of the warm-up. At the two-minute mark, the speed is increased
by 0.5 miles per hour and is increased by this amount every two minutes for
the remainder of the warm-up. This progression will have Tim running at the
starting pace for the lactate threshold test (7.5 mph) for the final two minutes
of the warm-up.

This approach accomplishes three things:

It allows Tim’s body to adjust to the metabolic demands of the starting
work rate of the lactate threshold test.
It allows Tim to experience the starting speed for the test and reduce
his apprehension going into the test.
It gives Tim the chance to experience the pacing progressions for each
stage of the lactate threshold test.

Once he has finished the warm-up, Tim steps off of the treadmill. He and the
exercise physiologist have four to five minutes to make final preparations for
the test. For Tim, this may include using the restroom, stretching, or doubleknotting his shoelaces to make sure they do not come untied and interrupt the
test once it has started. The exercise physiologist takes this time to doublecheck that all of the necessary equipment is at hand and properly calibrated.
To begin the test, the exercise physiologist starts the treadmill and sets the
starting speed of 7.5 miles per hour. Tim then steps on the treadmill belt, and
the exercise physiologist starts the stopwatch. After three minutes of running,
Tim straddles the treadmill belt and the exercise physiologist uses a needle
to make a small puncture in Tim’s finger. A small blood sample is taken from
the wound and introduced immediately to the lactate analyzer. The exercise
physiologist then places a small piece of gauze on Tim’s wound before the
treadmill speed is increased by 0.5 miles per hour, and Tim returns to running
on the treadmill. This procedure is repeated until an obvious and sustained
increase in blood lactate levels is observed over the course of several stages.
Upon termination of the test, the exercise physiologist plots the lactate
values against their respective running paces and sees an obvious inflection
point at a speed of 9.5 miles per hour. This pace is likely the highest average pace that Tim could maintain for a marathon. Because his objective is to
improve his ability before the competition, Tim should use 9.5 miles per hour
as a minimum pace for his long training runs, and paces in excess of 10 miles
per hour for interval workouts.
With proper training, Tim’s lactate threshold will increase, which will increase
his minimum training pace. Measureable improvements can be expected within
about four to six weeks, necessitating a subsequent retest of Tim’s lactate
threshold. These regular reassessments will be useful in assessing the efficacy
of the training program and in reestablishing proper training paces as Tim’s
ability improves.

The lactate threshold test is used to evaluate endurance exercise
capacity.
Lactate threshold is typically marked by a sharp increase in blood
lactate concentration in response to rising work rate.
Changes in blood lactate levels in response to changing work rates
provide insight into an athlete’s ability to efficiently catabolize carbohydrate for energy.
The lactate threshold can be indicative of an athlete’s maximal sustainable work rate and, thus, can be used to predict exercise performance
and prescribe training intensity.
Lactate threshold is responsive to endurance exercise training and
can therefore be used to evaluate the efficacy of a training program.
