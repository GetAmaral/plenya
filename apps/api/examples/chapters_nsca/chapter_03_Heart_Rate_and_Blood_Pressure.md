Heart Rate and Blood
Pressure
Daniel G. Drury, DPE, FACSM

Heart rate and blood pressure are two circulatory factors that ensure the
proper distribution of blood throughout the body. As physiological demands
change, each factor is adjusted to help perfuse the tissues with the right
amount of blood. Changes in position, exercise intensity, mode of exercise,
and state of arousal may result in an adjustment of heart rate and blood
pressure. Although both factors can be altered independently, they are
systemically interrelated so that an adjustment in one is often accompanied
by an adjustment in the other.
Because active heart rate is an indirect indicator of exercise intensity, it is
often used for monitoring, adjusting, and individualizing training programs.
Heart rate monitors have become more accurate and readily available in
recent years. Consequently, coaches and trainers have been able to help
athletes fine-tune their training by making the intensity of workouts relative to their own physiological capabilities. Furthermore, chronic training
adaptations can also be monitored by examining changes in the resting heart
rate as well as during exercise at any given exercise intensity.
The pressure in the arteries is in a constant state of flux and is continually being adjusted and readjusted. The circulatory system provides just the
right amount of blood pressure to meet the demands of a wide variety of
activities. Although blood pressure is not commonly used as an indicator of
fitness, it is important for trainers to understand blood pressure norms and
the circumstances that may lead to rapid increases or decreases in blood
pressure. Fluctuations in pressure enable athletes to circulate more blood
to more tissues when needed. Because each activity requires a unique
blood pressure response, trainers need to understand the mechanics of this
dynamic system.

Heart Rate Control
Heart rate (HR) is a simple yet valuable indicator of cardiorespiratory function. At rest, the heart typically beats between 60 and 80 times per minute.
However, in highly conditioned athletes, the physiological adaptations of
endurance training can result in a resting HR as low as 28 beats per minute
(Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney 2008). This decrease is thought to be a result
of an increase in the stroke volume of the heart in combination with an
increase in the parasympathetic influence of the nervous system. Conversely,
a high resting heart rate could be a sign of poor cardiorespiratory function,
overtraining, increases in stress, and a host of other factors that may be
counterproductive to clients.
Heart rate measurements must be taken under certain physiological
conditions. First, experts recommend that resting heart rate (RHR) be
taken early in the morning on an empty stomach. During sleep and times
of relaxation, the sympathetic nervous system has less drive, which allows
the heart rate to better reflect the parasympathetic influence. The subject
should be seated or recumbent and in an environment free of distraction.
If RHR is being tracked over time, the measurement should be taken under
similar circumstances each time.
During exercise, HR is a good indicator of relative exercise intensity and
is used widely to monitor cardiorespiratory function in both health and
disease (Ehrman et al. 2009). The heart muscle is one of the few tissues
capable of generating its own impulse, and it does this at the sinoatrial (SA)
node, which is located on the right ventricle (Marieb and Hoehn 2010).
The SA node is considered the pacemaker of the heart. It is innervated
by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers that emanate from the
medulla oblongata and the cardiorespiratory control centers within the
central nervous system (see figure 3.1). Both sets of nerve fibers innervate
the SA node; the atrioventricular (AV) node provides a tonic influence that
can be either enhanced or depressed. The sympathetic nerve fibers increase
heart rate, whereas parasympathetic nerve fibers slow it down. At rest,
parasympathetic influence usually dominates control of the HR by reducing
the heart’s natural, or inherent, rate of about 100 beats per minute (bpm)
to somewhere between 60 and 80 bpm (Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney
2008). At the initiation of exercise, the removal of parasympathetic influence initially allows the heart rate to increase to about 100 bpm, followed
by an increase in sympathetic activity that further accelerates HR based on
circulatory demands (Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney 2008).

Exercise Intensity and Heart Rate
HR can be used as an indirect and noninvasive measure of exercise intensity because of its strong correlation with exercise intensity and oxygen

consumption (Adams and Beam 2008). Numerous cardiorespiratory fitness tests use exercise HR to estimate or predict oxygen consumption by
assessing a steady state HR (SSHR) at a given workload (Franklin 2000).
SSHR is indicated when the circulatory demands of the current activity
have been met by the circulatory system, and no further increases in HR
are necessary (Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney 2008). At this point, because
HR neither increases nor decreases substantially, it can be used to indicate
the demands of that specific workload.
SSHR that occurs at any given absolute workload can vary significantly
based on the person’s fitness level. For example, if a sedentary person and
a highly trained person of similar size and stature were walking together

45


46

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

at 4 miles per hour (6.5 km/h), the sedentary person would likely have a
much higher HR than the trained person, despite similar levels of oxygen
consumption. This disparity in efficiency is also reflected in the way HR
is adjusted between workloads. In short, an inefficient cardiorespiratory
system relies on increases in HR more dramatically to meet the demands
of an increased workload. Eventually, as exercise intensity increases, the
sedentary person would approach maximal HR at a much lower workload
compared to the trained person. Furthermore, after exercise has stopped,
the trained person’s HR would return to normal much more rapidly than
that of the sedentary person, providing yet another way HR can be used
to predict cardiorespiratory efficiency (Adams and Beam 2008). Given the
relative ease of measuring HR, combined with the many ways HR can be
used to predict cardiorespiratory efficiency, it is obvious why HR has been
so widely used in the health and fitness industry.

Maximal Heart Rate
Maximal heart rate (MHR) is the greatest number of heart beats per unit
of time that can be attained during an all-out effort to exhaustion. This
number does not seem to be altered substantially by increases in cardiorespiratory efficiency or cardiorespiratory training. Rather, MHR seems to
decline with age and is often predicted by subtracting one’s age from 220
(Karvonen and Vuorimaa 1988). This value is appropriately called an agepredicted maximal heart rate (APMHR). For example, a 40-year-old male
would estimate his APMHR as follows: 220 – 40 (age) = 180. Although this
method of estimating maximal HR can vary considerably among people and
is only an estimate, it is still used widely as a field method to establish the
upper limits of HR, without exposing people to the maximal effort needed
to measure a true maximal HR (Franklin 2000).

Heart Rate Reserve
Once APMHR has been calculated, this information can be used to establish
exercise intensity guidelines based on heart rate reserve (HRR) (Franklin
2000). This prediction formula includes one variable that is affected by age
(APMHR or maximal HR) and one factor that is affected by the state of fitness (RHR). Determining RHR and APMHR permits the calculation of the
number of beats the person can potentially use to meet the demands of
exercise (i.e., beats held in reserve). Heart rate reserve is found by subtracting RHR from APMHR.
Once the number of beats in reserve has been determined, a percentage
of this reserve can be calculated by simply multiplying this number by the
desired exercise intensity expressed as a percentage. By adding a percentage of the beats held in reserve onto RHR, a target HR can be determined
to provide some objective criteria for monitoring training intensity. Both a


Heart Rate and Blood Pressure

minimum and a maximum training HR can be determined so that a desired
training zone adaptation can be established. Athletes can train at a much
higher percentage (70 to 85%) of their HRR as compared to sedentary
or recreational athletes (55 to 70%). Often referred to as the Karvonen
formula, this technique is based on research Dr. M. Karvonen conducted
in the 1950s (Karvonen and Vuorimaa 1988). This formula is often used
by having athletes maintain a certain HR intensity as they complete their
cardiorespiratory training.
Here’s an example of how to calculate training intensity using the heart
rate reserve method. Begin by first determining the age-predicted maximal
heart rate by subtracting the person’s age from 220 (APMHR = 220 – 22
[age] = 198 bpm). Next, subtract the resting heart rate from this number to
determine the number of beats that are held in reserve (198 [APMHR] – 72
[RHR] = 126 bpm [HRR]). In this case, the athlete literally needs a minimum
of 72 beats per minute to meet the body’s demands at rest and 198 beats
to exercise at maximal intensity. Therefore, 126 beats are held in reserve.
These beats can be added to the resting heart rate to increase the circulation
of blood as needed. For a person wanting to train at approximately 70% of
HRR, the calculation would look like this:
126 (HRR) × 0.70 (%) = 88.2 beats per minute
Target training HR = 72 (RHR) + 88.2 = 160 bpm (70% of HRR)

What truly makes this formula unique is the fact that a trained athlete
with a low resting heart rate will increase this reserve by meeting the resting demands with fewer beats. This ultimately increases the heart rate
reserve. At the same time, the natural decrease in maximal heart rate is also
considered in the formula. Ultimately, the following formula can be used:
Target heart rate = [fractional intensity (maximal HR – resting HR)] + RHR

Sport Performance and Heart Rate
The intensity of training can be closely monitored to control and hopefully optimize the training regimen and adaptations (Franklin 2000). For
example, if an athlete has a low degree of cardiorespiratory fitness, it might
be appropriate to have her maintain a pace high enough to challenge her
current cardiorespiratory efficiency, but not so high that she cannot sustain
the exercise. As her fitness improves over time, the relative intensity of
exercise that is reflected by HR can be increased so that she is constantly
pushing herself to improve. The Karvonen method of maintaining exercise
intensity provides a customized upper and lower HR limit that can be used
to help the athlete remain motivated and focused on maintaining a specific
relative intensity. If used religiously, monitoring HR can be a great way to
quantify the difficulty of workouts over time, giving the coach or trainer
some additional objective insight as to how the athlete is feeling.

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Many practitioners establish target heart rate by simply calculating a percentage of the age-predicted maximal heart rate, although this method is
not as robust as the Karvonen method. At first glance, this method appears
rudimentary and generic because the formula does not consider anything
but age. However, the exercise intensity established using this method is
indeed specific to the person because each person requires a unique amount
of work to reach any given target heart rate. Therefore, a sedentary 20-yearold and an athletic 20-year-old may have the same predicted values, but
the exercise intensity needed to reach these values would be considerably
different.
Figure 3.2 demonstrates the exercise heart rate range for a 35-year-old
who wants to improve fitness (green zone). Because this person is not fit
enough to handle the intensity required to increase performance (red zone),
he should probably ease off on the intensity and choose a level more appropriate for his current state of fitness. Over time, the level can be adjusted,
but it is probably best to be conservative when prescribing intensity so that
the client remains motivated and develops a base of fitness to build on.
An athlete may use these target heart rates to cycle the intensity of
training in a given workout or throughout the training season. Consider a
soccer midfielder who has the physiological challenge of executing anaerobic bursts of speed throughout a game that lasts well over an hour. The
training program for this athlete should most likely involve days focused
on endurance as well as days that include high-intensity interval training.
Heart rate can be used in both of these situations. For long endurance
training, the athlete may want to maintain a certain moderate intensity by
monitoring his heart rate over the course of a long run. As cardiorespiratory improvements are gained over time, his heart rate will decrease at any
given speed providing evidence that a faster pace may be needed to initiate
additional improvements in fitness. Conversely, when the athlete engages in
anaerobic interval training, heart rate can still be a valuable tool. Although
heart rate is not an indicator of performance during sprinting activities, it can
be an indicator of recovery between sprints. As the season approaches, the
trainer can adjust the recovery interval to provide a customized challenge
for the athlete or to slowly introduce a gamelike physiological challenge
that will translate into improved performance.

Heart Rate Measurement
There are numerous ways to measure HR including palpation, auscultation, Doppler ultrasonic monitoring, and electrical monitoring. Although
electrocardiography is considered the gold standard for HR measurement,
other methods can be used with varying degrees of accuracy. The following sections provide brief descriptions of the techniques most often used
in nonclinical settings.

Palpation
Palpation is the process of determining heart rate by feeling the distension
of the arteries as a bolus of blood passes through the vessel. Numerous
large arteries run close to the surface of the skin making them ideal for
palpation. Two of the most commonly used locations for HR palpation are
the radial artery on the palm side of the wrist (figure 3.3a) and the carotid
arteries (figure 3.3b).
Deeper arteries and those surrounded by excessive adipose tissue can
make palpating the pulse difficult. Also, exercises such as walking and
running during measurement can confound the ability to count a pulse
because the rhythmic body movements make distinguishing pulse waves
difficult. Furthermore, it is important not to occlude (pinch) the artery with
the pressure of the fingers. This is especially important when taking a pulse
using the carotid artery; occluding the artery can hamper blood flow to the
brain leading to syncope (dizziness) and possibly injury. The technique is
to locate a relatively large artery, place the fingertips over it, and count the
number of beats that occur in a given period of time.
Procedure
1. The procedure begins by counting the first pulsation detected as zero
and then counting the number of completed beats for the predetermined period of time.
2. Because HR is usually expressed in beats per minute (bpm), the
amount of time a pulse is monitored is conveniently divisible into 60

49

seconds. For example, a pulse taken for 10 seconds can be multiplied
by 6 to estimate bpm. Time increments of 15 seconds × 4) and 30
seconds (× 2) are also commonly used. It is important to note that
smaller increments of monitoring time can amplify uncounted partial
beats resulting in counting errors (Adams and Beam 2008).
3. Another palpation method for measuring HR involves determining
the amount of time required for the heart to complete 30 beats and
then dividing this time period into the constant of 1,800. This technique is based on the fact that 30 beats, or any given number of beats,
will occur in a shorter period of time as the heart rate increases. The
constant 1,800 is used so that smaller increments of one tenth of a
second can be used for a 30-beat period to determine HR (Adams and
Beam 2008). This test is simplified further by using a chart with the
calculations already completed. This technique is often considered
more accurate than time interval techniques because only completed
cardiac intervals are counted. With the time interval techniques, a
small error in counting or estimating partial beats can result in a large
error when multiplied.
Example 1: 30 beats in 15.0 seconds
1,800 / 15 seconds = 120 bpm

Example 2: 30 beats in 10.0 seconds
1,800 / 10 = 180 bpm

Heart Rate and Blood Pressure

Auscultation
The counting techniques used for monitoring HR are very similar for auscultation and palpation. However, with auscultation the pulse waves that
are felt are replaced by the sounds of the myocardium, large arteries, or
both. A stethoscope facilitates hearing and counting the sounds associated
with heart contractions.
Procedure
1. The diaphragm of the stethoscope should be placed directly onto the
subject with the entire diaphragm of the stethoscope flush with the
surface of the skin. The diaphragm should be placed over the apical
(apex) region of the heart or over the base of the heart between the
second and third ribs just below the proximal end of the clavicle
(Adams and Beam 2008). Slight pressure on the diaphragm may
improve the quality of the heart sounds.
2. Once the stethoscope is in place, similar procedures to those of palpation can be used to count or time the beats of the heart. Both the
palpation and the auscultatory methods are easier to conduct during
exercise than at rest. Although the beats are occurring at a much
faster pace during exercise, the strength of the pulse waves and of the
contraction of the heart make the pulse easier to feel and hear.

Electrocardiography
Although electrocardiography (ECG) is often reserved for clinical and
research settings, calculating HR using this tool is not difficult and does
not require extensive training. The ECG wave form is created by a unified
moving wave of ions flowing through the heart as the signal to contract is
passed from the SA node to the AV node and down the bundle branches
(Guyton 1991). The normal electrocardiogram is composed of a P wave
(atrial depolarization), a QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), and
a T wave (ventricular repolarization). The specialized electrogenic system
found in the heart conducts the rhythmic electrical impulse. Because cardiac
tissue transmits electrical signals rapidly, the heart can contract in a coordinated and unified manner, which creates a detectable electrical impulse.
A basic representation of the wave form associated with one cardiac cycle
is depicted in figure 3.4. Note that the wave with the highest amplitude
(R wave) is associated with the contraction of the ventricles. This wave is
most often used to calculate HR in healthy people.
ECG strips are useful in a clinical setting because abnormalities in the
timing (seconds) and amplitude (millivolts) of the basic wave form can be
predictive of various forms of myocardial pathology. However, ECG analysis
can also be used to establish an exact HR under resting and exercise conditions (Goldberg and Goldberg 1994).

Calculating HR using an ECG strip is possible because the standard ECG
paper is printed with graph lines that represent specific time intervals. As
the paper is produced from the electrocardiograph, the wave forms associated with each beat are printed on the paper. Because the paper is produced
from the electrocardiograph at a consistent pace (25 mm/sec), the timing
between heart beats can be used to determine HR by calculating the amount
of time between two consecutive R waves using the standardized ECG graph
paper (Goldberg and Goldberg 1994).
Procedure for Calculating Heart Rate Using an ECG Strip
1. Indentify two consecutive R waves.
2. Count the number of small boxes (mm) on the graph paper between
the R waves.
3. Divide the number of small boxes (mm) into 1,500 to obtain HR.

Example: 1,500 / 20 (ECG squares) = 75 (see figure 3.5)


Heart Rate and Blood Pressure

Heart Rate Monitors
In recent years, the technology of personal HR monitoring devices has
improved significantly (Boudet and Chaumoux 2001). These devices function using the same principles as ECG machines, but are made to detect
only HR using small electrodes impregnated into a reusable chest strap. The
electrical impulse generated by the heart is monitored by these electrodes,
which are then sent, via telemetry, to a digital display worn on the wrist.
A mean HR is reestablished and updated about every five seconds giving a
valuable and objective way to determine relative exercise intensity. More
advanced HR monitors interface with computer tracking programs that
can display training HR over time. HR monitors are a useful addition to a
comprehensive approach to monitoring an exercise regimen.
Monitoring HR can be valuable for gaining insight into this important
cardiorespiratory variable both at rest and during exercise. Developing the
skills for monitoring HR should be high on the list of any exercise professional, and these skills should be practiced frequently.

Blood Pressure
Blood pressure (BP) is the force that the blood exerts on the walls of all the
vessels within the cardiovascular system (Venes 2009). Although the term
blood pressure seems to refer to a singular factor, blood pressure is actually
established and maintained by the working of numerous variables simultaneously to ensure the pressure necessary for blood circulation under a
variety of conditions (Guyton 1991). Among other things, these factors
include the elasticity of the vessels, the resistance to flow before and after
the capillaries, and the forceful contraction of the left ventricle, as well
as blood volume and viscosity (Smith and Kampine 1984). BP fluctuates
throughout the day based on metabolic demands, body position, arousal,
diet, and many other factors (Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney 2008). Furthermore, numerous hormonal, hemodynamic, and anatomical factors working
together ultimately ensure the pressure needed for adequate circulation of
the blood (Perloff et al. 1993).
Understanding the basic physiology of BP control and assessment is
of critical importance to those involved in health promotion and health
care. As one of the basic vital signs used to evaluate health, BP needs to be
maintained within a certain range. At rest, normal systolic blood pressure is
maintained between 100 and 120 mmHg, whereas diastolic blood pressure is
maintained between 75 and 85 mmHg. BP that is chronically elevated (i.e.,
hypertension) can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.
If BP drops too low (i.e., hypotension), blood delivery can be compromised,
which may eventually lead to circulatory shock. During exercise and other
strenuous activities, BP must be altered to deliver larger and larger amounts

53

of blood and oxygen to the tissues. This section provides a basic summary of
the factors associated with the physiological control and measurement of BP.

Hypertension
Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factors among
Americans (Pickering et al. 2005b). This insidious disease is relatively easy
to diagnose, but goes undetected primarily because symptoms are not
readily apparent to the average person. The cause of primary hypertension
remains elusive, yet the diagnosis and treatment of this condition are relatively inexpensive. Therefore, regular monitoring of BP can be an effective
screening tool to help those at risk recognize this potentially life-threatening
condition prior to a major coronary event. Although the etiology and physiology of hypertension are far beyond the scope of this chapter, table 3.1,
from the American Medical Association, has been included indicating the
various hypertension classifications for adults. Although the diagnosis of
hypertension should be reserved for a medical professional, the day-to-day
monitoring of BP can be self-performed at home or performed by another
trusted health and wellness professional; proper procedures need to be followed (Pickering et al. 2005a).
Because BP tends to fluctuate throughout the day, hypertension may be
incorrectly diagnosed or even undetected, based on the time and circumstances in which it has been measured. To ensure an accurate diagnosis,
people need to monitor BP at different times during the day, preferably under
the circumstances of natural daily living. This can now be performed with
a 24-hour BP monitor (Clement et al. 2003), which can be worn underTable 3.1 Classification of Hypertension

neath clothing to work, around the house, and even during exercise. The
primary advantage of these machines is that they permit people to monitor
BP during real-life circumstances rather than only in a physician’s office
or other clinical setting. This may be helpful in preventing what is called
white coat syndrome—that is, an artificially high BP due to the nervousness
caused by visiting a physician’s office.

Hypotension
Hypotension is experienced when the pressure in the system is compromised or insufficient to maintain the circulatory demand. A systolic pressure of less than 90 mmHg, a diastolic pressure of less than 60 mmHg, or
both, generally indicate hypotension. This lack of pressure can leave the
heart, brain, and muscles with an insufficient blood flow. Hypotension can
occur from dehydration related to heat illness as well as other pathological
conditions. Although much less common than hypertension, hypotension
can be a very serious medical condition. The diagnosis of hypotension is
highly individualized but is characterized by a significant drop in pressure
from normal. What may be too low for one person, however, may be fine
for another (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004536/).
Typically, signs of hypotension are dizziness, disorientation, or confusion. Other signs are blurry vision, fainting, and weakness. Hypotension
may occur acutely with an orthostatic challenge (change in position) and
may be caused by alcohol, certain medications, and a variety of medical
conditions. People who experience hypotension on a regular basis should
strive to identify the specific trigger and seek medical attention if necessary.
Preventive measures include ensuring proper hydration, avoiding alcohol,
and avoiding long periods of standing in one place. (www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004536/).

Pressure Gradients and Blood Pressure
The movement of blood through the circulatory system depends on the
development of pressure gradients (PG) (Venes 2009; Wilmore, Costill, and
Kenney 2008). When blood is put under pressure, it automatically seeks
an area of lower pressure in all directions. When an area of lower pressure
is introduced, the blood flows in that direction based on how large the
difference is between the pressure of the current compartment, the pressure of the new environment, and the resistance to flow within the vessel.
Within the arteries, capillaries, and veins, PGs must be created to facilitate
the movement of blood (Smith and Kampine 1984) . Blood moves from the
heart into the circulation based on the PG created by the forceful contraction of the heart in relation to the pressure in the aorta. Initially, the blood
that leaves the left ventricle of the heart and enters circulation is under
relatively high pressure as the heart rhythmically contracts and relaxes

paign, IL: Human Kinetics), 8.
1998). After systole has concluded
and the aortic valve closes, these
vessels recoil and squeeze the blood, creating yet another PG that moves
the blood to vessels downstream. In each case, the blood moves down its
PG seeking an area of lesser pressure while moving closer to the capillaries where the exchange of gasses and nutrients can take place (figure 3.6).
Once the blood has entered the capillaries, the majority of the pressure
created from the heart itself has been dissipated, and the blood entering the
venous side of the circulatory loop is under very low pressure as it travels
back to the heart (Smith and Kampine 1984; Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney
2008). To facilitate this flow in an environment of very low pressure, the
venous circulation is supported by three mechanisms that also create PGs.
The first mechanism lies in the anatomical configuration of one-way valves
located within the veins. These valves are arranged to promote unidirectional flow to combat the pull of gravity on the blood as it travels back
to the heart. These structures allow blood to travel in only one direction,
preventing backflow and venous pooling.
The skeletal muscles work in conjunction with the one-way valves by
increasing intramuscular pressure within the active muscles. These contractions help create a PG by squeezing the blood in the veins of the muscles.
Finally, the respiratory system facilitates venous blood movement by creating a cyclic pressure difference within the thorax that corresponds to the
rising and falling of the diaphragm. Both the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps help “milk” the blood through the veins so that it returns to

the heart under the influence of almost no pressure. PGs are essential for
the movement of blood through the circulatory system. Anatomically, the
human body is designed to circulate blood by creating PGs to facilitate blood
movement (Marieb and Hoehn 2010).

Arterial Blood Pressure
BP varies considerably in different parts of the cardiovascular loop. The
term blood pressure is often used generically to refer to arterial blood pressure (ABP), which is expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) (Adams
and Beam 2008). The arterial portion of the cardiovascular loop begins at
the aorta and ends at the arterioles, just prior to the capillaries. Because of
their elastic nature, these vessels can accommodate the dynamic pressure
changes during systole and diastole. ABP is not a static pressure within the
system, but a dynamic relationship between the upper and lower values
achieved between beats and over time. It is also important to note that ABP
is not representative of the pressure throughout all of the arteries, but is
more of a reflection of the pressure in the large arteries that are subject
to the greatest degree of pressure fluctuation. Therefore, ABP is expressed
as two pressures. The highest pressure created in the vessels during left
ventricular contraction is referred to as the systolic blood pressure (SBP)
(Pickering et al. 2005b). Conversely, the lowest pressure occurs during the
relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle and is called the diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) (Pickering et al. 2005c). It is important to note that these pressures
represent only the extremes of pressure at any given time and that ABP is
truly in constant flux between these two pressure measurements.
The mathematical difference between SBP and DBP is termed pulse pressure (PP). At rest, an elevated PP may be used as an indicator of arterial
compliance (Adams and Beam 2008). During exercise and other vigorous
activities, one would expect the PP to increase as the need for additional
flow is increased. Theoretically, SBP is an indicator of the pressure of blood
entering the arterial circulation, whereas DBP represents the resistance
of blood to leaving. Therefore, if the difference between these pressures
increases during exercise, more blood must be both entering and leaving
the arterial circulation indicating a greater flow through the tissues.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated using SBP and DBP.
Although ABP is always in transition within the arterial system, MAP represents the average pressure in the arteries at any given time. At rest, the
pressure generated during systole represents approximately one third of the
entire cardiac cycle, whereas the diastolic phase is approximately twice as
long (Adams and Beam 2008). Therefore, the formula for calculating resting
MAP must account for the fact that the heart is in the diastolic relaxation
phase for a longer period of time as compared to the contraction phase. The
formula for calculating MAP at rest is as follows:

57


58

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

Resting MAP = 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP
Example: 120/80 (120 systolic and 80 diastolic)
80 DBP × 0.666 = 53 mmHg
120 SBP × 0.333 = 40 mmHg
MAP = 53.28 + 39.96 = 93 mmHg

During exercise, the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle is reduced as the
heart rate increases making the systolic and diastolic phases approximately
equal. Consequently, the formula for MAP changes slightly to account for
this change:
Exercise MAP = 1/2 DBP + 1/2 SBP
Example: 140/80 (140 systolic and 80 diastolic)
80 DBP × 0.50 = 40 mmHg
140 SBP × 0.50 = 70 mmHg
MAP = 40 + 70 = 110 mmHg

Arterial Blood Pressure Regulation
Under resting conditions, the volume of blood on the arterial side of the
circulatory loop is relatively small (13%) compared with the volume contained in the capacitance vessels of the venous circulation (64%) (Wilmore,
Costill, and Kenney 2008). At rest, this distribution of blood is sufficient to
meet the pressure and circulatory demands of the body. However, when an
increase in ABP is needed, it can be achieved by mobilizing the blood from
the venous side of the loop and redistributing it over to the arterial side
(Powers and Howley 2007). Arterial blood pressure is dynamically altered
by manipulating the factors that control the volume of blood within the
system. Arterial blood volume can be changed by increasing or decreas˙ ), increasing or decreasing total peripheral resistance
ing cardiac output (Q
(TPR), or changing both factors simultaneously.
Cardiac output is the total amount of blood that leaves the left ventricle
each minute. It is calculated by considering the stroke volume multiplied by
the number of cardiac cycles (HR) completed in one minute. Total peripheral resistance represents the resistance the blood encounters while flowing
from the arterial side of the cardiovascular loop over to the venous side.
The interplay between the amount of blood entering the arterial circulation
and the amount of blood allowed to leave ultimately determines whether
ABP increases, decreases, or stays the same (Smith and Kampine 1984).

Acute Arterial Blood Pressure Regulation
The cardiovascular system is equipped with a negative feedback system
that detects ABP changes and reports them to the central nervous system,
which responds with adjustments to blood pressure. These reports are sent
to the central nervous system by specific pressure or stretch receptors called


Heart Rate and Blood Pressure

baroreceptors (Smith and Kampine 1984; Marieb and Hoehn 2010). Strategically located in the aortic arch and carotid arteries, baroreceptors provide
a tonic flow of information to cardiovascular centers within the medulla
(Marieb and Hoehn 2010). Under low-pressure circumstances, afferent
input to the brain is decreased, and the brain responds by increasing and
decreasing sympathetic and parasympathetic drive, respectively (Marieb
and Hoehn 2010; Wilmore, Costill, and Kenney 2008). Consequently, heart
rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) increase leading to increases in blood
volume in arterial circulation. A concurrent increase in TPR prevents too
much blood from exiting the arterial circuit, which ultimately expands arterial blood volume and pressure. Under higher nonexertion-based pressure
situations, adjustments are made in exactly the opposite manner (Marieb
and Hoehn 2010).

Exercise and Arterial Blood Pressure Regulation
As the result of an acute bout of aerobic exercise, SBP will typically increase
to meet the metabolic demands of the tissues. DBP will most likely stay the
same, leading to an expansion of both MAP and PP (Wilmore, Costill, and
Kenney 2008). A release of the sympathetic neurotransmitters epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (N-EPI) causes an increase in both HR and
SV contributing to an expansion in arterial blood volume and ultimately
ABP. At the same time, this sympathetic response causes a temporary vasoconstriction of the peripheral vessels allowing relatively less blood to exit
the arterial circulation in comparison to the amount flowing in from the
˙ . Together, these variables temporarily expand arterial blood
increase in Q
volume, increase ABP, and promote a greater distribution of the blood to
active tissues.
Consider the blood pressure requirements of cycling on a flat surface and
of cycling up a 5-mile (8 km) hill. While a person is cycling on flat ground,
a slight increase in blood pressure will easily provide the leg muscles with
the additional pressure needed to supply the active tissues with more blood.
However, when the intensity of exercise increases while cycling up a hill,
more blood flow will be needed to supply the oxygen requirements of the
leg muscles. More of the leg muscles will be active, and more blood will be
delivered. But this cannot be achieved without an increase in ABP.
Prolonged, vigorous activity resulting in excessive sweating leads to a
decrease in plasma volume resulting in dehydration, an increase in hemoconcentration, and a decrease in blood pressure. Under these conditions,
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is produced and then secreted by the hypothalamus. Also known as vasopressin, ADH acts on the kidneys to help
retain water in an effort to dilute the hemoconcentration (Wilmore, Costill,
and Kenney 2008).
During acute bouts of intense anaerobic activity (e.g., weight training),
SBP is likely to increase substantially along with a concomitant increase

in DBP. Pressures as high as 480/350 mmHg have been recorded during
maximal lifts (MacDougall et al. 1985). For this reason, weight training has
historically been contraindicated for many people with cardiovascular disease. However, the American Heart Association has recently acknowledged
the safety and potential value of strength training as a mode of therapeutic
exercise if contemporary recommendations are followed (Thompson et al.
2007).
The degree to which both SBP and DBP will be elevated seems to be linked
to the relative intensity of the exercise. In this context, relative intensity refers
to the amount of weight being lifted in comparison to the person’s maximal
capabilities (MacDougall et al. 1992). During maximal or near-maximal lifting efforts, people often hold their breath, initiating the Valsalva maneuver
(VM) (Venes 2009). Although this tends to stabilize the core, it can also
cause spikes in SBP and DBP (Sale et al. 1994; Sjøgaard and Saltin 1982).
For this reason, people at risk for cardiovascular disease should avoid it.

Long-Term Regulation of Arterial Blood Pressure
Arterial blood pressure is largely regulated by the kidneys and several key
hormones. Recall that the kidneys filter the blood continuously and help
balance the extracellular fluids within the body (Robergs and Roberts
1987). When the body becomes dehydrated, the kidneys conserve water to
maintain fluid balance. Conversely, when the body has an excess amount
of water, the kidneys determine how much to excrete (Kapit, Macey, and
Meisami 1987). The process of fluid balance becomes very important to
the understanding of blood pressure because excess fluid held in the blood
can contribute to hypertension (Robergs and Roberts 1987). Furthermore,
excessive fluid loss from the blood can also be extremely dangerous. Because
arterial blood volume ultimately dictates arterial blood pressure, fluid balance within the extracellular fluid and blood can be of critical importance
for regulating blood pressure.
When the body loses excessive amounts of fluid, the kidneys secrete the
enzyme renin, which activates the plasma protein angiotensinogen. After
several enzymatic conversions, angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II in the lungs; angiotensin II has
two primary effects that can elevate blood pressure. First, it is an extremely
powerful vasoconstrictor that increases TPR. Second, it decreases the excretion of Na+, which ultimately increases extracellular fluid. Furthermore, this
process triggers the minerlocorticoid aldosterone, which promotes sodium
reabsorption enabling the body to retain fluids as they pass through the
kidney. Therefore, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism helps to
maintain blood pressure by increasing TPR while simultaneously attempting
to balance the extracellular fluid that in turn affects blood volume.


Heart Rate and Blood Pressure

Arterial Blood Pressure Measurement
Early methods for measuring ABP used water columns to measure pressure,
but these systems were very large and were subject to significant fluctuations on a beat-by-beat basis (Adams and Beam 2008). Eventually, mercury
columns were created resulting in a much more compact and manageable
fluid column. Today, ABP is universally reported in millimeters of mercury
(mmHg) regardless of the apparatus used for measuring (Pickering et al.
2005a). Despite their accuracy, sphygmomanometers that use mercury are
susceptible to breaking and exposing the mercury, which is a toxic substance
that is very dangerous to humans. For this reason, many health professionals have switched to automated BP cuffs or to aneroid devices. These
devices can be highly accurate if calibrated regularly (Canzanello, Jensen,
and Schwartz 2001; Clement et al. 2003; Pickering et al. 2005a).
Although ABP can be measured using indwelling catheters inserted
into arterial vessels, this is a very invasive form of measuring ABP and is
reserved for the clinical setting (Pickering 2002). A much more common
technique using a sphygmomanometer can measure ABP at rest and during
vigorous exercise (O’Brien, Beevers, and Lip 2001). Often referred to as
the cuff method, this technique uses an inflatable tourniquet to temporarily occlude blood flow through the brachial artery. As the pressure is bled
from the cuff, the technician listens to the artery below the cuff through a
stethoscope and auscultates the various Korotkoff sounds.
Arterial blood pressure can be measured using Korotkoff sounds based
on how the blood flows through the brachial artery. Initially, the cuff is
inflated to a pressure that literally prevents any blood flow through the
artery. Because no blood is passing through the artery, no sounds or vibrations are detected beyond the cuff by the stethoscope. As the air pressure
in the cuff is slowly released, the technician listens for the initial bolus of
blood to pass through the previously occluded artery. This first Korotkoff
sound is indicative of systolic blood pressure (SBP) because the pressure in
the artery must be higher than the pressure in the cuff if the blood in the
artery has the PG needed to flow forward past the cuff through the semiconstricted artery (Franklin 2000).
As the cuff continues to be deflated, greater amounts of blood pass
through the artery and the cuff during the systolic phase of each heartbeat.
The classic lub-dub sound is heard while auscultating the heart directly.
However, the sounds heard during blood pressure measurement are created
by the blood that passes through the cuff when the pressure in the system
exceeds the pressure in the bladder of the cuff. Because the cuff is still
impeding some of the flow that would naturally pass through the brachial
artery, vibrations can still be auscultated during this phase. Eventually, as
the pressure in the cuff continues to fall, normal blood flow is restored. The
pressure at which the restoration of normal blood flow and the concurrent
disappearance of sound heard through the stethoscope occur is the diastolic
blood pressure (DBP).

Procedure
1. Have paper and pencil available to record SBP and DBP.
2. The subject should be seated in a quiet environment with the arm
resting on a table approximately at heart level.
3. Apply the appropriate-sized cuff around the midpoint of the upper
arm centering the bladder over the brachial artery approximately 2
centimeters above the antecubital fossa. The aneroid gauge should be
at eye level for visual inspection.
4. Place the stethoscope ear pieces in the ear canals so that they are
angled forward. Be sure that the bell of the stethoscope is rotated to
the low-frequency position by lightly tapping on the diaphragm.
5. Place the head of the stethoscope over the brachial artery below the
cuff and medial to the antecubital fossa. Press the head of the stethoscope so that the entire circumference of the diaphragm is in contact
with the skin.
6. Inflate the bladder rapidly by squeezing the bulb to a pressure that is
approximately 30 mmHg above the suspected or previously recorded
systolic pressure.
7. Open the release valve on the bulb and slowly (3 to 5 mm/sec) deflate
the air from the bladder listening for the initial appearance of the
Korotkoff sounds (see table 3.2 for Korotkoff sounds).
8. Continue to reduce the pressure listening for the sound to become
muffled (fourth phase of DBP) and finally disappear (fifth phase of
DBP). Normally, the fifth phase is recorded as DBP.
9. Once the sounds disappear, continue to slowly deflate the cuff for
another 10 mmHg to ensure that no further sounds are audible; then
release all of the air from the bladder and wait a minimum of 30 seconds before repeating these procedures.
10. Average the two trials together and record these values for future
reference.

The measurement of ABP is a relatively easy procedure that can be performed accurately without extensive medical training if standardized procedures are followed closely. Although the procedural steps are relatively easy
to understand, it often takes years of experience to learn how to take blood
pressure accurately and reliably (Canzanello, Jensen, and Schwartz 2001).
Methods and procedures for taking blood pressure have been published by
the American Heart Association (Pickering et al. 2005a).

Professional Applications

As described earlier in the chapter, resting heart rate can be used as a measure
of fitness. Typically, a lower resting heart rate is indicative of better cardiovascular health. Although this adaptation is common among those who have achieved
a high level of cardiorespiratory efficiency, it is possible that a highly trained
athlete will maintain a normal resting heart rate (60 to 80 bpm). Furthermore,
untrained people can also have relatively low heart rates that are not the result
of cardiorespiratory training. The important factor here is that the fitness professional have a baseline measurement that can be used for future comparison.
Both increases and decreases in resting heart rate can be important.
It is also important to note that a variety of external factors can affect resting
heart rate. Stress, caffeinated drinks, various medications, and overtraining
are all factors that can elevate resting heart rate. Fitness professionals must
recognize why someone might have an elevated resting heart rate and consider
ways to help the person reduce this number. A chronically elevated resting heart
rate (100+ beats per minute) may require medical attention. Teaching athletes
to monitor their own resting heart rates during periods of intense training may
be helpful in determining a potential problem.
The use of heart rate as a training tool is a skill that all fitness professionals should master. This relatively simple skill is easy to execute and can
be of great value to both the client and the trainer. The primary reason this
technique is so widely used is that heart rate is a reflection of how the body is
responding to the current physiological challenge. People can report verbally
how they are feeling, but this is of limited value when they are influenced by
other nonphysiological factors. For example, an ex-athlete may wish to appear
strong and tough during a vigorous workout that actually exceeds his current
physical condition. His verbal response may be that he is feeling fine when in
reality he is on the edge of exhaustion. This may also happen in a group exercise class in which a client does not want to be identified or perceived as the
weakest link. The social pressure to keep up with the group may cause people
to overextend themselves. A simple measurement of heart rate can provide
some objective feedback that may tell the trainer and the client what’s really
going on. Consequently, the intensity of the workout can be altered so that
the client can continue to exercise rather than having to quit once undeniable
fatigue has set in. This is a safer approach for everyone involved.

Finally, it is important to acknowledge the relatively new technology related
to heart rate monitors. Not only has the price of these devices come down, but
also the usability and technical programming have also improved. One particular
feature that can be very useful is the pacing feature in which an audible beeping sound is triggered when the person reaches a predetermined target heart
rate zone. Heart rate monitors can give audible feedback when the exercise
intensity is too high or too low. This is a great feature for distance athletes as
well as for people who want to monitor their pace closely. Once the workout
is complete, many new systems allow users to download results for tracking
purposes. This is an affordable and accurate way to provide some objective
data and analysis to what has traditionally been a subjective process.

Resting heart rate can be used as a measure of cardiovascular health.
Maximal heart rate can be estimated by subtracting the person’s age
from 220.
Training intensity can be monitored using heart rate because of the
correlations among oxygen consumption, workload, and heart rate.
Training intensity can be established using exercise heart rate. The
Karvonen method is a valuable formula for determining the minimal
and maximal heart rate that should be achieved during a workout.
Measuring heart rate is an easy, inexpensive, and valuable skill to
learn for fitness professionals.
Arterial blood pressure is the pressure that the blood exerts against
the arterial walls.
Although the arterial blood pressure is in constant flux, it is typically
reported by writing the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure.
Systolic pressure is the pressure in the system while the heart is
pumping, whereas diastolic pressure is the pressure in the arterial
system between heartbeats.
Arterial blood pressure can be either too high (hypertension) or too
low (hypotension). Fitness professionals should be familiar with both
extremes.
