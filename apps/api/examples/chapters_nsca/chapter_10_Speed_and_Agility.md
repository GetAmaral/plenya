Speed and Agility
N. Travis Triplett, PhD, CSCS*D, FNSCA

Speed and agility are important components of nearly every athletic performance (Hoffman 2006). Both involve moving the body as rapidly as
possible, but agility has the added dimension of changing direction. Sport
coaches typically spend time working with athletes on developing speed
and agility by focusing on movement technique and reaction time in drills
(Plisk 2008). Tests for speed are simple and straightforward, but agility tests
vary greatly from those that involve little movement and mostly footwork
to those that involve sprinting with multiple changes of direction, with and
without a reaction to a varying stimulus. However, speed and agility tests
are easily customizable to the sport or desired task.
Measuring speed and agility can help the fitness professional spotlight
weaknesses in sport or task performance, which can help direct training
goals (Harman and Garhammer 2008). For example, because speed, agility,
or both are direct components of many sport movements, testing for either
or both can provide information about the effectiveness of drills or other
activities in practice, as well as serve as a measure of an athlete’s abilities
compared to those of other athletes in the same sport or position. The fitness
professional can then use the information to alter the prescribed training program, or individualize aspects of a training program for a particular athlete.

Speed
Speed is classically defined as the shortest time required for an object to move
along a fixed distance, which is the same as velocity, but without specifying
the direction (Harman and Garhammer 2008). In practical terms, it refers
to the ability to move the body as quickly as possible over a set distance.
However, in reality, the issue is slightly more complex because speed is not
constant over the entire distance and can therefore be divided into phases

253


254

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

for most people (Plisk 2008). The first phase is acceleration, or the rate
of change in speed up to the point at which maximum speed is reached.
The second phase is maintenance, in which the top speed is maintained
for the remainder of the distance of interest. This varies with the distance
to be tested. For example, the acceleration phase for a 40-meter sprint is
approximately 10 meters, whereas the acceleration phase for a 100-meter
sprint is approximately 30 to 40 meters (Plisk 2008).
If the distance is too long (>200 m), a deceleration phase may also occur,
which should be avoided if possible (Harman and Garhammer 2008).
Because acceleration and deceleration can occur during maximal running,
tests of speed provide information about average speed over the distance
of interest. Given the fact that people cannot maintain maximal speed
for a long period of time, tests of speed must be shorter than 200 meters,
and most are 100 meters or shorter (Harman and Garhammer 2008). This
ensures that significant deceleration does not occur, and that the test is not
a measurement of aerobic or anaerobic capacity (Harman and Garhammer
2008), which are better measured by other methods (see chapters 5, 7, and
8, respectively).

Agility
Agility is most often defined as the ability to change direction rapidly (Altug,
Altug, and Altug 1987). This can take many forms, from simple footwork
actions to moving the entire body in the opposite direction while running
at a high speed. Thus, agility has a speed component, but it is not the most
important component of this trait. The basic definition of agility is too
simplistic, because it is now thought to be much more complex involving
not only speed, but also balance, coordination, and the ability to react to
a change in the environment (Plisk 2008). Some tests of agility may even
involve some muscular or cardiorespiratory endurance, but those fall into
the category of anaerobic capacity tests (see chapter 8).
The primary difference between tests of speed and tests of agility is that
during the agility test, the body movement is stopped and restarted in a different direction. To accomplish this, the subject has to decelerate and then
accelerate in the new direction, something that is avoided in speed tests.
The goal in agility tests is to accomplish the deceleration and acceleration as
quickly and efficiently as possible. In contrast, the goal in speed tests is not
to decelerate at all but rather to reach and maintain top speed as quickly
as possible. These parameters are interrelated, however, because speed is a
component of agility performance.
A person may be able to change direction very quickly, but if the intervening phases of the agility test are performed slowly, the overall test will


Speed and Agility

be compromised. Thus, the examiner must have an understanding of and
be able to communicate proper acceleration and deceleration techniques
to the subject so the test results are not limited by poor running technique.
In general, proper acceleration to top speed involves increases in both
stride length and stride frequency with an accompanying decrease in the
degree of body lean (Plisk 2008). The primary difference between accelerating in a speed test and accelerating in an agility test is that often the
subject has much less distance in which to accelerate in an agility test, and
the body position from a prior deceleration and direction change may limit
the subject’s ability to reach full stride length and stride frequency. Regarding deceleration, in general, the degree of body lean should increase, and
the entire foot should make contact with the running surface (Plisk 2008).
The degree of directional change is influenced by the test setup; some
tests require a hard directional change (e.g., a power cut on a line to reverse
direction), and others allow for a less severe directional change (e.g., rounding a cone). In any case, the more severe the directional change, the lower
the speed and the greater the body lean at that point, so proper deceleration
is essential to maximize time efficiency (Plisk 2008).
At the end of any test, the subject should be instructed not to slow down,
but rather to run through the finish line or gate, to minimize deceleration.
Other technique points are to have the subject visually focus on the target
(e.g., cone, line) when performing the test, unless instructed otherwise,
such as when shuffling to the side while facing forward.
A component of agility tests that can make them more sport specific is
reactive ability to a stimulus that dictates the new direction of movement,
instead of letting the subject know the directions of the test beforehand. This
technique is not used in every agility test; it is most commonly used as an
advanced method to increase the specificity to actual sport environments.
Agility tests that do not involve any change in stimuli are considered
closed-skill tests (Plisk 2008). These tests are performed in a stable environment in which the subject knows the test course and which direction
to go. Conversely, open-skill tests are unpredictable; the direction is determined by another person, such as a coach or other trainer. Reactive ability
is emphasized in open-skill tests, as are balance and coordination, because
the movement direction cannot be anticipated. Closed-skill tests are used
more often because the conditions can be standardized and norms exist.
Additionally, closed-skill tests have greater test–retest reliability because the
test format can be the same for each subject every time. Because of their
variability, open-skill tests are more often used for training drills or for a
quick assessment of athlete performance on a given day without regard to
improvements in the test over a period of time.

Sport Performance and Speed and Agility
Most sports, even endurance sports, have speed or agility as a component.
Except in sports such as track or swimming where there is minimal or no
change in direction, speed and agility are both important aspects of sport
performance. The most successful American football lineman, for example,
is the one who can react most quickly to the snap of the ball and get off
the line toward the opposing player the quickest. Similarly, the best soccer
or ice hockey players can change direction and take off with the ball or
puck the fastest. Assessing speed and agility in a controlled environment
with a test that is similar to the actual demands of the sport of interest is
therefore highly useful in helping to design training in order to improve
sport performance.

Test Selection
One of the most important steps in using performance tests occurs before
the subject even reports to the testing area. Test selection is vital because
it affects the validity of the results. The first consideration is that the test
represent the physiological demands of the sport. Thus, the fitness professional must have an understanding of the basic energy systems and other
physiological traits that would affect sport performance, such as body size.
Because many sports require a variety of abilities (e.g., speed, agility, power,
anaerobic capacity), a battery of tests is often used to address each of the
abilities separately.
Biomechanical factors, such as movement pattern specificity, are important to consider when selecting a test; one agility test may be better for
ice hockey, and another, for tennis, for example. Training level is also an
important consideration. Tests that involve a higher level of skill or fitness
may not be appropriate for novice subjects because their poor technique or
conditioning could limit their test performance. Similarly, the sex or age of
participants has an impact on test selection; some tests would be difficult for
females to complete (i.e., a chin-up test), and others may be inappropriate
for prepubescent children.
Testing parameters may be modified to mimic sport characteristics. For
example, subjects undertaking an agility test for American football can be
required to carry the ball during the test. Tests can also be designed to be
more specific to a certain sport movement, but the basic principle of validity
must be followed to ensure that it measures what it is supposed to.
Tests of speed and agility should be short, usually less than 20 seconds;
longer tests may target the wrong energy systems, and fatigue may affect
the results. If an agility test course is too complex, for example, subjects
won’t be able to build up speed between turns. In any instance, if a test is
modified in any way, the published norms are no longer applicable. New

norms have to be developed by testing numbers of subjects over time. Table
10.1 provides a summary of speed and agility test characteristics.

Methods of Measurement
Both speed and closed-skill agility tests require very little equipment. These
tests can typically be accomplished with a stopwatch, a tape measure to
set the course, and markers of the course, such as cones. Using automated
timing devices can increase the accuracy of the tests, but having the same
person time each subject may be all that is necessary to ensure reliable
results. Open-skill agility tests are more difficult to standardize because
the testing environment is unpredictable. Standardization of procedures,
such as how many direction changes there will be per test, and fixing the
distance to be moved when a directional change is indicated, will increase
the test reliability.
The subject should be adequately warmed up before beginning any testing procedure. Although there are no set guidelines for a warm-up, it is

257


258

NSCA’s Guide to Tests and Assessments

generally recommended that subjects first perform three to five minutes
of a low-intensity, large-muscle-group activity such as jogging or riding a
stationary bicycle to increase circulation to the whole body. Then, more
specific warm-up activities can be performed such as executing the movement or test at half or three-quarter speed.
If the participant has range of motion limitations in the lower body, some
light dynamic stretching may be recommended so that the appropriate range
of motion can be attained for the activity (Bandy, Irion, and Briggler 1998;
Hedrick 2000; Mann and Jones 1999). Because other types of stretching,
especially static stretching, have been shown to compromise performance
in speed, strength, and power activities, the focus should remain on the
warm-up and stretching should be minimal prior to performance (Behm,
Button, and Butt 2001; Church et al. 2001; Fletcher and Jones 2004; Nelson
and Kokkonen 2001; Power et al. 2004; Young and Behm 2003).

Factors Influencing Test Performance
For test results to be reliable, many things must be taken into consideration in addition to properly planning for test administration (i.e., training examiners). Factors such as environmental conditions may affect test
performance and should be noted, particularly when tests are administered
outside where weather (temperature, humidity, precipitation) is variable.
Other, more controllable factors include subjects’ hydration and nutritional
status. Instructions can be given to subjects regarding water consumption
and pretest meals, which can be replicated for repeat test sessions. Dehydration is known to adversely affect performance, and subjects should
consume a pretest meal that is well tolerated. Finally, subjects should be
well rested following training sessions (at least 48 hours), and should be
given adequate rest periods (5 to 20 minutes) between tests when a battery
of tests is being performed.

Tests of Speed
In order to determine a person’s maximum speed, tests of speed should be
short (<200 meters) and not involve changes of direction. Additionally, the
acceleration phase of movement should be accounted for by setting a test
length that allows the subject to attain maximum speed and maintain it
for several seconds. Thus, the shortest speed tests are in the 30- to 40-yard
range. This method of testing reduces the influence of factors such as fatigue
or deceleration and will result in the most accurate determination of speed.


Speed and Agility

40-Yard Sprint Test
The most common test of speed is the 40-yard sprint. It is used in the NFL
Combine, as well as in many collegiate sport programs in the United States.
It is also used in laboratory methods classes in exercise science and physical
education academic programs. This test is most appropriate for sports that
may have an extended run, such as soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse, in
addition to American football. It is also short, fast (<7 seconds), and simple
to time. This test is also easily modified to shorter and longer distances to
be even more specific for sports such as baseball and basketball. Norms for
some of these distances are provided in table 10.2. As with all tests of speed,
the main objective is to cover the distance as quickly as possible, and usually no more than three attempts are performed to minimize the decline in
performance caused by fatigue.

Procedure
After instructing the subject on the correct performance of the test, follow
these steps:
1. The subject lines up behind the start line, facing forward. Sport-specific
stances can also be used, such as a three-point stance as in American
football (see figure 10.1a) or a four-point stance as in track (see figure
10.1b).

2. The subject should be given a countdown, either verbally or, if using
timing gates, by using the beeps programmed into the timing gate
unit. Alternatively, an electronic switch activated by the subject’s
movement can be used.
3. The subject should be allowed two or three trials, with three- to fiveminute rests between to ensure nearly full recovery.
4. If using a stopwatch, start the watch at the subject’s first movement.
Times are typically recorded to the nearest 0.01 second. Hand timing
can result in times that are 0.24 second faster (Harman and Garhammer 2008) than the time recorded using a timing gate. Thus, consistency in equipment from test to test and with repeated tests of the
same subject is essential.
5. Modifications to the distance can include the 30-yard sprint (basketball) or the 60-yard sprint (baseball), which are more specific to those
sports. Any distance can be used, but norms for performance may not
be available.
Reliability
The 40-yard sprint is a highly reliable test with test–retest reliabilities typically above .95, but ranging from .89 to .97.
Norms
See table 10.2.

10-Yard Sprint Test
The short 10-yard sprint test is used to determine a person’s ability to accelerate, because the acceleration phase in the 40-yard sprint is approximately 10
yards. Although this test is less commonly used, it can provide information
about an athlete’s ability to accelerate quickly, because much time can be
lost during this phase. This test is good for any sport that requires a lot of
short sprints, such as American football, bobsled, speedskating, gymnastics,
basketball, rugby, baseball, and tennis, because it mimics very closely a start
off the line or sprint for the ball. Again, the main objective is to cover the
distance as quickly as possible. Four or five trials with two- or three-minute
rests between them may be performed because fatigue is less of a factor
than in the 40-yard sprint.

these steps:
1. The subject lines up behind the start line, facing forward. Sport-specific

football or a four-point stance as in track.
2. The subject should be given a countdown, either verbally or, if using

Times are typically recorded to the nearest 0.01 second. Hand timing
can result in times that are faster than the times recorded using a
timing gate. Thus, consistency in equipment from test to test and with
the same subject performing repeated tests is essential.
Reliability
The test–retest reliability for the 10-yard sprint test is .89.
Norms
See table 10.2.

60-Yard Sprint With Flying 30 Yard
The “flying” refers to the fact that the 30-yard measurement is taken
between yards 10 and 40 of the distance, after the person has accelerated
and is in motion (i.e., not from a standing or 3- or 4-point stance). This
longer sprint test is used to determine a person’s ability to accelerate and
to maintain top speed, as well as the person’s top speed without taking
into account the acceleration phase. It can therefore provide a multitude
of data about how the person reaches and maintains speed. This test is
most appropriate for athletes in sports that require extended runs, such as
baseball, soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse. The main objective is to cover
the distance as quickly as possible, and usually three trials or fewer are performed to minimize the decline in performance caused by fatigue, because
this is a bigger factor than in the 40-yard sprint.

3. The subject should be allowed two or three trials, with three- to fiveminute rests between them to ensure nearly full recovery.
4. Personnel should be at the finish line or at both the start and finish
lines, as well as at the intermediate lines. For example: the start line,
the timer or gate at 10 yards, the timer or gate at 40 yards, and the
timer or gate at 60 yards (finish). They should record times for:
■■
0-10 yards = acceleration
■■
0-40 yards = 40-yard time (top speed)
■■
10-40 yards = flying 30-yard time
■■
0-60 yards = 60-yard time (speed maintenance)
5. If using a stopwatch, start the watch at the subject’s first movement.
Times are typically recorded to the nearest 0.01 second. Hand timing
can result in times that are faster than those recorded using a timing
gate. Thus, consistency in equipment from test to test and with the
same subject performing repeated tests is essential.
Norms
See table 10.2.

Tests of Agility
Determining a person’s agility can be complex because agility involves acceleration, speed, deceleration, balance, and coordination. Agility tests should
be very short (<40 yards) and must involve multiple changes of direction.
Agility test results can be greatly affected by a person’s ability to accelerate
and decelerate, so coaching proper acceleration and deceleration technique
is necessary to obtain the most accurate test results.

5-10-5 or Pro-Agility Test
A common test of agility is the 5-10-5, or pro-agility test, also known as
the 20-yard shuttle run. It is used in the NFL Combine, as well as in many
collegiate sport programs in the United States. It is also used in laboratory
methods classes in exercise science and physical education academic programs. This test is best suited for athletes in sports requiring short sprints
and a reversal of direction, including basketball, baseball, softball, soccer,
and volleyball, in addition to American football. Like the tests of speed, the
main objective is to cover the distance (and thereby change direction) as
quickly as possible. Three trials or fewer are usually performed to minimize
the decline in performance caused by fatigue.

2. The subject is given a countdown, either verbally or, if using timing
gates, by using the beeps programmed into the timing gate unit.
3. The subject starts the test by turning to the left and sprinting for 5
yards; then turning to the right and sprinting for 10 yards before turning back to the left and sprinting for 5 yards. This returns the subject
to the start line. The lines marking the distance must be contacted by
the foot.
4. The subject should be allowed two or three trials, with three- to fiveminute rests between them to ensure nearly full recovery.
5. Personnel should be at the start/finish line. The test starts and finishes
on the same line.
6. If using a stopwatch, start the watch at the subject’s first movement.
Times are typically recorded to the nearest 0.01 second. Hand timing
can result in times that are faster than those recorded using a timing
gate. Thus, consistency in equipment from test to test and with the
same subject performing repeated tests is essential.
7. Modifications to the test can include performing the test while holding
a football, or starting the test in a three- or four-point stance. However,
the listed norms will not be applicable, and new norms will have to
be generated.
Reliability
The test–retest reliability for the pro-agility test is .91.
Norms
See table 10.3.

T-Test
A common test of agility is the T-test. It is used in many collegiate sport
programs, and in laboratory methods classes in exercise science and physical
education academic programs in the United States. This test is best suited
for athletes in sports that require that they sprint forward, move laterally,
and backpedal, including American football, soccer, basketball, baseball,
softball, and volleyball. Like the tests of speed, the main objective is to
cover the distance and change direction as quickly as possible. Three trials
or fewer are usually performed to minimize the decline in performance
caused by fatigue.

Procedure
After instructing the subject on the correct performance of the test, follow
these steps:
1. The subject lines up at the start line, at the base of the T (cone A). An
upright stance is typically used, and the subject should face forward.
2. The subject should be given a countdown, either verbally or, if using
timing gates, by using the beeps programmed into the timing gate unit
or the electronic switch.
3. The subject starts the test by sprinting straight ahead for 10 yards and
touching the base of cone B with the right hand. The subject then
shuffles left for 5 yards and touches the base of cone C with the left
hand. Next, the subject shuffles 10 yards to the right, all the way to
the farthest cone (D), and touches the base of the cone with the right
hand. Finally, the subject shuffles left back to the middle cone (B),
touches it with the left hand, and then backpedals to the starting point
(cone A). The subject faces forward at all times during the test and
is not allowed to cross the feet during the shuffling. Also, the middle
cone (B) is not touched when shuffling between the two farthest
cones (C and D).
4. The test can also be performed in reverse, going to the right first instead
of to the left, and the hand that touches the cone would switch as
well. Other modifications to the test can include suspending a tennis
ball at cones C and D and having the subject use forehand and backhand strokes to strike the ball (whichever is appropriate depending

on whether the subject plays right- or left-handed) at each cone.
5. The subject should be allowed two or three trials, with three- to fiveminute rests between them to ensure nearly full recovery.
6. Personnel should be at the start/finish line. The test starts and finishes
on the same line.
7. If using a stopwatch, start the watch at the subject’s first movement.
Times are typically recorded to the nearest 0.01 second. Hand timing
can result in times that are faster than those recorded using a timing
gate. Thus, consistency in equipment from test to test and with the
same subject performing repeated tests is essential.
Reliability
The T-test has a test–retest reliability range of .93 to .98.
Norms
See table 10.3.

Three-Cone Test
Another test of agility is the three-cone test. It is used in the NFL Combine,
as well as in some collegiate football programs in the United States, but
norms are available only for American football because the test was developed for that sport. Similar to the other tests of agility, the main objective
is to cover the distance as quickly as possible, and change direction without
losing much time. Three trials or fewer are usually performed to minimize
the decline in performance caused by fatigue.
Equipment

3. The subject start the test by sprinting forward 5 yards to cone B (1) and
touching the cone; then turning around and sprinting back to cone A
(2) and touching that cone. Without stopping, the subject should turn
around and sprint back to cone B (3), but this time run around cone
B and head to cone C (4), circling around it and coming back around
cone B (5) on the outside before returning to cone A (6), the starting
point. The only time the cones are touched are in the first part of the
test, as described.
4. Modifications to the test can include performing the test while holding
a football, or starting the test in a three- or four-point stance. However,
the listed norms will not be applicable, and new norms will have to
be generated.
5. The subject should be allowed two or three trials, with three- to fiveminute rests between to ensure nearly full recovery.
6. Personnel should be at the start/finish line. The test starts and finishes
on the same line.

Edgren Side Step Test
The Edgren side step test is an agility test that measures footwork. It is not
commonly used, but norms are available for ice hockey players. The main
objective is to cover the distance and change direction as quickly as possible. Three trials or fewer are usually performed to minimize the decline
in performance caused by fatigue.
Equipment
Track or field or court where the distance can be measured
■■ Tape measure
■■ Stopwatch
■■ Cones or tape to indicate course layout (see figure 10.5)

Procedure
After instructing the subject on the correct performance of the test, follow
these steps:
1. The subject lines up straddling the start line, which is the middle line.
An upright stance is used, and the subject should face forward.
2. The subject should be given a countdown and should start the test
by sidestepping to the right until the farthest line is crossed by the
right foot. The subject then sidesteps left until the left foot crosses the
farthest left line. Count the number of lines crossed while the subject
repeats this procedure for 10 seconds.
3. The subject is not allowed to cross the feet; doing so results in a 1-point
deduction in the score.
4. The subject should be allowed two or three trials, with three- to fiveminute rests between them to ensure nearly full recovery.
5. Personnel should be at the start line.
6. Start the stopwatch at the subject’s first movement. Times are typically
recorded to the nearest 0.01 second.

Hexagon Test
Another agility test that measures footwork is the hexagon test. It can be
used in sports in which foot placement in all directions and cutting movements are common, such as basketball, soccer, rugby, and American football;
norms are available for ice hockey players. The main objective is to cover
the course and change direction as quickly as possible without losing one’s
balance. Three trials or fewer are usually performed to minimize the decline
in performance caused by fatigue.
Equipment
This test is best performed indoors.

Procedure
After instructing the subject on the correct performance of the test, follow
these steps:
1. The subject stands in the middle of the hexagon in an upright stance
and faces forward.
2. The subject should be given a countdown and starts the test by
double-leg hopping from the center of the hexagon across one side
of the hexagon and back to the center. This is performed in a clockwise direction until each side of the hexagon is crossed and the entire
hexagon is traversed a total of three times.
3. The subject must face the same direction for the entire test and should
not land on a line or lose balance and take an extra step or fail to cross
a line. If this occurs, the trial is stopped and restarted.
4. Start the watch at the subject’s first movement and stop it when the
subject returns to the center of the hexagon for the last time.
Reliability
The range of test–retest reliability for the hexagon test is .86 to .95.
Norms

Professional Applications

The primary purpose of performing any test should be to gain information
about where a person is compared to performance standards in the field or
sport. The information can be used for a multitude of purposes, which include
the establishment of a baseline value for a new athlete, the measurement of
progress as a result of targeted training to improve a particular performance
characteristic, and the determination of changes over the course of a competitive season or a phase of training. The test results should then be used to
design the next phase of training.
Test selection is vital to this process because not all tests for a particular
trait, such as speed or agility, are the most appropriate for specific performance
characteristics of a sport or activity. For example, although the 40-yard sprint is
the most common test of speed, for a sport such as rugby, in which the runs are
very short before being tackled, a 10-yard sprint test may be more appropriate.
In contrast, a longer sprint test such as the 60-yard may be more appropriate for
baseball players, especially outfielders, or even to simulate running two bases.
Tests of agility can be even more sport or activity specific. The pro-agility test
would be very appropriate for tennis, for example, because it closely mimics
baseline play. The T-test would also be a good test for tennis because it consists of forward, lateral, and backward movements, such as would occur when

coming forward to play the net, moving in the front of the court, and returning to
the baseline to resume a rally. However, the three-cone test is most appropriate
for American football because it most resembles a play in football in which the
player runs forward but then turns around and runs in the opposite direction or
to the left or right after the ball carrier.
Most sports consist of several performance variables, and speed and agility
are rarely mutually exclusive, except in track, which includes races that are purely
based on speed (and endurance). Multiple tests may therefore be selected to
provide the best overall physical profile of an athlete or individual. If multiple
tests are necessary, the testing order becomes extremely important to ensure
the best performance while minimizing the effects of fatigue.
Because speed and agility tests are very close in energy system demands,
there are not specific recommendations for testing order. The main concern
would be to provide adequate rest between tests and to make sure the subject
is warmed up. This may mean a 10- to 15-minute delay between tests, depending on how many attempts are required. Because speed and agility tests are
very short, providing adequate rest between repeat attempts (usually two to
five minutes) is easily accomplished.
The testing environment is also critical to ensure the best performance results.
Safety is of primary concern, and the results that fit published norms are those
from tests performed on the least variable surfaces, such as tracks and courts.
However, the most sport-specific results are obtained in the conditions in which
the athlete performs in training and competition. Although performing speed
tests on a track is desirable in terms of the ease of marking the distance and
providing the most consistent surface, it would also be acceptable to perform a
40-yard sprint on a soccer field for soccer athletes, as long as enough subjects
could be tested to generate new norms. However, if the test is to be primarily
used for goal setting, it should be performed on the least variable surface, leaving the replication of competition conditions to the sport practices.
Finally, once test results are obtained, they must be properly interpreted.
It is of little use to compare athlete values to published norms if the testing
was performed under vastly different conditions than those used to establish
the norms. Other factors such as training experience can influence test performance because familiarity with a test can increase performance. The time of
the training year in which the test is done can strongly influence test results as
well. For example, the results of an agility test done with a group of basketball
athletes after the off-season or after a maintenance phase of training would not
be as good as those from a test performed after the preseason conditioning.
Understanding the sport or activity from a physiological and mechanical perspective is necessary for proper test selection, and performing the tests in a
safe and controlled environment will result in the clearest results. Ultimately,
the information can be used to design better training and exercise programs.

■■

■■

Tests of speed and agility are used in a multitude of environments,
from the exercise science research laboratory to the physical education or exercise science classroom, strength and conditioning facility,
and fitness club.
Speed and agility tests are simple to administer, do not require expensive equipment, and can provide valuable information about clients’
strengths and weaknesses or progress with a training program or
phase of a program.
Test selection should be based on the abilities and limitations of the
client and the goals of the client’s training, sport, or both.
Also, these tests lend themselves easily to modification, which allows
for a great degree of flexibility in test administration and application
of the information obtained from the test.
