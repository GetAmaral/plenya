CHAPTER 8
Functional Anatomy
of the Feet and Ankles
The feet and ankles act as shock absorbers when
the body interacts with a contact surface, and they
help the body adapt to the terrain. They also contain
several key soft tissues and muscles that help resist
gravity and dissipate ground reaction forces (Davis,
Davis, and Ross 2005; Frowen et al. 2010).

BONES AND JOINTS
The many bones and joints in the foot and ankle
complex provide framing and unyielding support
for the foot and ankle and help form its shape and
structure (Dimon and Day 2008). The soft tissues
assist the skeletal structures in maintaining the
shape of the foot and ankle when it is placed under
stress during exercise and other weight-bearing
activities. By controlling movement, these soft tissues protect the underlying skeletal structures from
damage, and they also provide feedback to the body
about the nature of the contact surface (Page, Frank,
and Lardner 2010).

SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES
Here we describe several key soft tissue structures
so that you can understand how they help with and
influence movement. These structures are in part
supported by (and intricately linked with) the muscles of the feet and ankles, and therefore they can be
negatively affected by musculoskeletal imbalances.

ARCHES OF THE FEET
There are three arches in the feet (figure 8.1) made
of a combination of bones, muscles, fascia, ligaments,
and tendons:
1. The medial longitudinal arch
2. The lateral longitudinal arch
3. The transverse arch
The two longitudinal arches run along the sides of
the foot from the heel to the toes. These two arches
are intricately designed to help displace the weight
of the body as it comes forward over the foot and to
dissipate ground reaction forces as they travel back
up to the body. The foot is also arched transversely
(across the foot) to enable it to interact softly with
the ground as weight is displaced from side to side
and to provide additional stability and mobility to
the foot so it can adapt to the terrain of the contact
surface. The arches of the feet also lift the structures
of the foot up and away from the ground to help
protect these areas from injury (Clemente 2011).
The medial longitudinal arch is the prominent,
big arch that runs along the inside of the foot from
the heel to the base of the big toe. It is formed by the
bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and fascia on
the medial side of the foot. This arch is an excellent
shock absorber, and it helps dissipate weight and
force forward and toward the midline of the body
(Dimon and Day 2008).

The lateral longitudinal arch lies on the outside
of the foot. It is made up of the bones, ligaments,
tendons, muscles, and fascia on the lateral side of
the foot. This arch is supported by many muscles
that wrap under the outside of the foot (Dimon and
Day 2008). Visually, this arch appears flatter than
the medial longitudinal arch. It is much more solid
and is capable of less movement than its medial
counterpart. The lateral longitudinal arch works in
conjunction with the medial longitudinal arch to support the weight of the body during weight-bearing
activities (Clippinger 2007).
The longitudinal arches of the foot are supported
and maintained by a combination of factors. The
tendons of various muscles that run below the apex
of each arch help to maintain the height of these
arches. The tendons of other muscles that run
lengthwise along the foot help provide tension in
these arches (Snell 2008). The shape and sequencing of the bones in the foot and the ligaments that
hold them together form an interlocking mechanism
that provides additional arch stability. The dense
fascia that runs along the sole of the foot also helps
support and maintain the shape of these important
structures (Dimon and Day 2008).

When your foot comes in contact with a surface
like the ground during gait, tension is created in the
structures of the longitudinal arches as the muscles
that support these arches (e.g., tibialis posterior,
tibialis anterior, flexor hallucis longus, abductor
hallucis, peroneals) elongate like bungee cords and
become taut. This tension helps slow down and distribute the transfer of weight forward over the foot.
This tension also helps stabilize the bones of the
foot which, conversely, provide additional structural
support for the arches (Dimon and Day 2008). The
activated muscles and soft tissue structures further
help the foot to transfer the dispersed weight forward from the heel toward the toes, and this facilitates the transfer of weight to the other side of the
body as you step forward to land on the other foot
(Clippinger 2007). As the gait cycle continues and
the other foot makes contact with the ground, the
longitudinal arches in that foot activate to continue
the shock absorption and weight transfer cycle.
The transverse arch in the center of the foot is
created by the bones (and their supporting ligaments
and muscles) in the midfoot area (Clippinger 2007).
In addition to the main transverse arch, the midfoot
also contains a series of small, dome-shaped transverse arches that run from side to side across the foot
just behind the start of the toes. These transverse
arches help dissipate shock from side to side and
provide a system of support as the foot transfers
weight laterally (Dimon and Day 2007).

where Justin talks about the arches of the feet.

ACHILLES TENDON
The Achilles tendon is a very important structure in
the lower leg that connects the posterior calf muscles
(gastrocnemius and soleus) to the heel bone (see
figure 8.2). This tendon helps produce a lot of energy
to assist with the powerful movements required to
squat, lunge, walk, jog, and run.
When a person is walking, squatting, or lunging,
the lower leg moves ahead of the heel while the foot
is in contact with the ground. During these types of
movements, the forward movement of the lower leg
over the foot is accompanied by a bend in the knee
that creates tension in the Achilles tendon as the
soleus muscle lengthens. The tension in the Achilles tendon and soleus activates the “bungee cord”
function of these structures to slow the forces on
both the knee and the ankle joint as they bend (see
figure 8.3) (Hyde and Grenbach 2007).

As a walking or running movement progresses,
the foot stays in contact with the ground as the leg
travels behind the body into hip and leg extension.
During this motion, the lower leg continues over
the foot as the knee straightens. This movement
causes the gastrocnemius muscle to lengthen and
builds further tension in the Achilles tendon to slow
down stress on the ankle as it continues to bend and
on the knee as it straightens (see figure 8.4). The
potential energy stored in this muscle and in the
Achilles tendon during these movements is then
used to pull the heel off the ground as the toes push
downward to generate forward propulsion. Therefore, the Achilles tendon and associated muscles of
the posterior calf play an important role in helping
slow down stresses on the foot, ankle, and knee
and in providing energy to propel the body forward
during gait (Kelikian 2011).

SLINGS OF THE FEET
Most of the muscles described in this chapter originate on the lower leg (or just above the knee, as in
the case of the gastrocnemius) and wrap under the
arches on either side of the foot or from around the
back of the foot. These muscles act as slings that pull
up on the feet and ankles, giving them tremendous
support (Snell 2008). This sling support mechanism
is very important in helping the body to interact
with contact surfaces and in helping to regulate
the transfer of weight forward and from side to side.
To help you better understand how the muscles of
the feet and ankles act as slings, just imagine pulling
a sock on over your foot. As you pull it up your leg,
the sock pulls on the underside of your foot, creating
tension on the sole of your foot. This pulling action
supports the foot during the entire time you are
pulling up the sock. The muscles of your lower leg,
feet, and ankles work in a very similar fashion. They

all wrap under and around your foot to ensure that
your foot has support and does not collapse under
your body weight (Price and Bratcher 2010).

MUSCLES
Now that we have examined the general functions
of the foot and ankle muscles, we will discuss the
details of certain key muscles in this area of the
body. These include:
■

Flexor hallucis longus

■

Abductor hallucis

■

Peroneus longus

■

Tibialis posterior

■

Tibialis anterior

■

Soleus

■

Gastrocnemius

Flexor Hallucis Longus
Muscle specifics: A long muscle that originates on the outside of
the fibula on the back of the lower leg. It travels down and across the
back of the lower leg and wraps around the inside of the anklebone.
It then runs the length of the underside of the foot and inserts near
the tip of the big toe on the plantar surface (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Pushes the big toe down (i.e., flexes the big toe),
pushes down the foot and ankle (i.e., plantar flexion) and rolls the
ankle to the outside (i.e., inverts the ankle) (Clippinger 2007).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the flexor hallucis
longus helps support the medial longitudinal arch. In supporting
this arch it directly helps to slow down overpronation of the foot and
thereby increases ankle dorsiflexion. The potential energy stored in
the muscle during these movements then helps the ankle and foot to
plantar flex and helps the foot to push off powerfully in movements
like walking and running.

Flexor hallucis
longus

Real-life movement example: Involved in supporting the foot and
resisting overpronation in weight-bearing activities such as walking,
squatting, lunging, jogging, and running.
Helpful tips: The flexor hallucis longus acts like a brake to help
prevent the foot and ankle from overpronating.

E6993/Price/TF08.01/584286/JB-R2


Functional Anatomy of the Feet and Ankles

Abductor Hallucis
Muscle specifics: A relatively small muscle on the
underside of the foot. It is located on the medial side
of the foot and travels from the heel bone to the first
bone of the big toe (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Pulls the big toe up and away from
the rest of the toes and foot (i.e., abducts and flexes the
big toe) (Muscolino 2010).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
abductor hallucis helps keep the big toe straight and
pointing forward to help support the medial longitudinal arch. This action helps the foot and ankle to resist
overpronation and encourages better dorsiflexion.
Real-life movement example: Involved in helping
maintain the structural integrity of the foot; ensures
that the big toe spreads out to increase the surface
area of the foot during weight-bearing activities such
as walking, squatting, lunging, jogging, and running.

Abductor
hallucis

Helpful tips: The abductor hallucis works in conjunction with the flexor hallucis longus to support the
medial longitudinal arch and to ensure that the big toe
is aligned and working correctly.
E6993/Price/Fig.08.02/584287/R1JB

Peroneus Longus
Muscle specifics: A part of the peroneal group of
muscles that originate on the outside of the lower leg.
The peroneus longus muscle travels down the leg, wraps
behind the ankle and under the foot, and inserts at the
base of the big toe (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Helps roll the foot and ankle inward
(eversion) and pushes the foot downward (plantar
flexion) (Golding and Golding 2003).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
peroneus longus helps support all the arches of the foot
because it wraps under the outside, travels across the
middle, and terminates toward the medial side. It also
plays a vital role in helping the foot to accept weight
and decelerate forces from both above and below.

Peroneus
longus

Real-life movement example: Involved in helping
maintain the integrity and strength of the arches of the
feet during weight-bearing activities such as standing,
walking, and running.
Helpful tips: The peroneus longus acts like a stirrup
running beneath the foot to help hold up the arches.

Tibialis Posterior
Muscle specifics: A long muscle that originates on the outside
of the lower leg on the back of the tibia and fibula. It runs down
and across the back of the lower leg, wrapping around the inside
of the anklebone, where it then inserts in the middle of the sole of
the foot (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Rolls the foot and ankle outward (inversion)
and pushes them downward (plantar flexion) (Golding and Golding 2003).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the tibialis
posterior helps to hold up the medial longitudinal arch and transverse arches and to slow down the internal rotation of the ankle.
The resulting deceleration of ankle and foot rotation helps prevent
overpronation. As the muscle lengthens, it stores energy to enable
the ankle to roll outward and the foot to push down.

Tibialis
posterior

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate the lower leg as it rotates over the foot during pronation. It
also helps to stop the medial and transverse arches from collapsing during weight-bearing activities like squatting, walking, and
jogging.
Helpful tips: Pain caused by irritation of the tibialis posterior can
feel like plantar fasciitis (i.e., inflammation of the underside of the
foot just forward of the heel bone).

E6993/Price/Fig.08.04/584289/R1JB

Tibialis Anterior
Muscle specifics: A long muscle that originates on the outside of
the front of the lower leg near the top of the tibia. It travels down
and across the front of the shin, crosses over the front of the ankle,
and wraps under the medial longitudinal arch before inserting in
the midfoot area (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Rolls the foot and ankle outward (i.e., inverts
the foot and ankle) and brings the toes and foot toward the shin
(dorsiflexion) (Kelikian 2011).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the tibialis
anterior helps to hold up the medial longitudinal arch; this helps
resist overpronation and collapse of the ankle. The potential energy
stored in the muscle as it lengthens enables the tibia to externally
rotate as the foot comes out of pronation (i.e., supinates) during
gait for a powerful push-off.

Tibialis
anterior

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate the foot during pronation. These movements happen in all
weight-bearing activities, especially those in which the foot is
not supported artificially by shoes or orthotics, such as barefoot
running.
Helpful tips: The tibialis anterior works in conjunction with the
tibialis posterior to help control the extent to which the tibia internally rotates and the foot pronates.

Soleus
Muscle specifics: One of the big muscles that form the posterior
calf of the lower leg. It is a deep muscle that originates high up on
the back of the lower leg on the tibia and fibula. It travels all the
way down the back of the lower leg and inserts at the heel via the
Achilles tendon (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Helps plantar flex the foot and ankle, especially
when the knee is bent (Muscolino 2010).
Real-life movements: In real-life movements that require the
ankle and knee to bend together, the soleus muscle lengthens under
load like a bungee cord to help decelerate the forward motion of
the ankle and the knee. This helps store potential energy in the
muscle to enable the foot and ankle to plantar flex and the knee
to extend.

Soleus

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate forward movement of the lower leg over the foot (dorsiflexion)
as the knee and ankle bend together during activities like squatting
or crouching down when gardening.
Helpful tips: The soleus works in conjunction with the gastrocnemius to help protect the knee and the ankle joint from too much
stress during weight-bearing activities.

Gastrocnemius
Muscle specifics: Another big muscle that helps form
the posterior calf. It originates at the bottom of the femur
on the upper leg. It travels behind the knee, all the way
down the back of the leg and inserts at the heel via the
Achilles tendon (Gray 1995).

E6993/Price/TF08.06/584291/mh-R1

Muscle action(s): Helps plantar flex the foot and ankle;
it also has a role in assisting with knee flexion (Golding
and Golding 2003).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
gastrocnemius helps decelerate the leg and knee as they
travel behind the body and straighten (extend) and the
ankle as it bends forward (dorsiflexes). Both the gastrocnemius and soleus work together during weight-bearing
activities to store potential energy that enables the foot
and ankle to plantar flex (push down).

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord
to decelerate knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion—
when the ankle bends and the knee straightens as the
leg moves behind the body—in all functional activities
such as walking and running.
Helpful Tips: The gastrocnemius works in conjunction
with the soleus to help protect the knee and the ankle
joint from too much stress.

EFFECT OF FOOT AND
ANKLE MUSCLES ON
THE MOST COMMON
MUSCULOSKELETAL
DEVIATIONS
The muscles just described play a vital role in mitigating the two most common deviations of the foot
and ankle. They provide strength and support to
absorb shock and transfer the body’s mass forward,
side-to-side, and in rotation during weight-bearing
activities. They also store potential energy to help
with propulsion and to create powerful athletic
movements. However, when musculoskeletal deviations affect the feet and ankles, they cannot perform
these crucial tasks correctly. The foot and ankle
structures can become strained and stressed, and
musculoskeletal compensation patterns elsewhere in
the body can become exacerbated, making everyday
activities and exercise problematic and painful.
To illustrate how the foot and ankle muscles help
prevent overpronation and lack of dorsiflexion, consider what happens when a person is walking. During
a normal gait cycle, the feet and ankles work together
to help stabilize the body’s center of gravity and
displace the weight of the body as it travels over the
foot (Chinn and Hertel 2010). This helps to maintain
an upright position and forward momentum. When
a person begins walking, the outside of the heel
connects with the ground first. At this point in the
gait cycle, the ankle is inverted and weight is on the
outside of the foot and heel. As weight is transferred
forward into the foot and it makes full contact with
the ground, the ankle rolls inward (pronates) and
bends forward (dorsiflexes) to transfer weight over
the entire foot (Donatelli and Wooden 2010).
These movements are critical to helping ensure
that the foot and ankle muscles act like bungee
cords to decelerate stresses. As the foot and ankle
pronate, the muscles that support the arches of the
foot lengthen under tension as the insertion points
of these muscles (under the foot) move away from
their points of origin (on the lower leg). This creates
potential energy, which is then used to help roll the
foot and ankle back out and to push the foot down

and off the ground to complete the gait cycle. This
motion becomes problematic when the foot and ankle
overpronate. When the muscles that limit pronation
do not work correctly or lengthen effectively, the
bungee cord effect is lost. Consequently, no tension
is created in the muscles to prevent the foot and
ankle from overpronating. This results in the ankle
failing to bend forward (dorsiflexing) enough to
transfer weight correctly over the foot (Donatelli
and Wooden 2010).
Here are two examples of how the bungee cord
action of specific muscles controls both overpronation and dorsiflexion.

EXAMPLE ONE: TIBIALIS
ANTERIOR AND TIBIALIS
POSTERIOR
As the foot pronates, the medial longitudinal arch
flattens out slightly and the toes move forward and
away from the heel. This causes the insertion point of
the tibialis anterior (in the midfoot area just behind
the toes) to pull away from its origin point on the front
of the tibia. This pulling motion creates tension and
activates the bungee cord effect that helps to support
the medial longitudinal arch and decelerate the foot,
ankle, and lower leg as they roll inward. The tibialis
posterior, which runs from beneath the foot, up and
across the back of the leg to its origin high on the back
of the tibia, also lengthens as the foot pronates. Its
bungee cord effect prevents the lower leg from internally rotating too quickly over the foot. The actions of
these two muscles help coordinate the timing of the
lower leg’s internal rotation and ensure that the foot
pronates at the appropriate rate. Since the movement
of the lower leg also affects the position and timing
of the knee as it moves medially, these muscles also
indirectly affect knee position and function.

EXAMPLE TWO: SOLEUS AND
GASTROCNEMIUS
After the heel has made contact with the ground
during the gait cycle, weight is transferred forward
as the lower leg and knee move over the foot. The
soleus originates high on the back of the lower
leg and is attached to the back of the heel by the


Functional Anatomy of the Feet and Ankles

Achilles tendon. As the knee and ankle bend, the
movement of its insertion point away from its origin
point enables the bungee cord feature to help control both dorsiflexion and knee flexion. As the gait
cycle continues, the foot remains in contact with the
ground as the leg extends behind the body. During
this movement, the gastrocnemius lengthens like a
bungee cord, and the tension in the muscle slows
down the lower leg as it continues to move forward
over the foot and the knee as it straightens.
Go to the online video to watch video 8.3,
where Justin talks about how dysfunction of
the calf muscles can affect the most common
imbalances.

If the calf muscles and other muscles of the foot
and ankle (such as the anterior and posterior tibialis
discussed in example one) do not prevent the foot
from overpronating, then the foot and ankle collapse, and the lower leg rotates inward too quickly
instead of coming forward over the foot as it should.
This disruption of the forward motion of the lower
leg over the foot is why overpronation and a lack of
dorsiflexion are inherently linked. Moreover, when
any of the other muscles of the feet and ankles discussed in this chapter are not working correctly,
overpronation and lack of dorsiflexion can result.
This can lead to the structures of the foot and
ankle becoming stressed, compensation patterns
developing elsewhere in the body and, over time,
pain or injury.

Review of Key Points
The muscles and soft tissue structures of the feet and ankles play an important role in helping to support and balance the body while it interacts with a contact surface.
■■Most of the muscles vital to the function of the foot and ankle complex come down from

the lower leg, wrap around the ankle, and attach on the underside of the foot. They act
like a sling support system to control the movement of the foot and ankle in all three
planes of motion and engage as weight is transferred over the feet and ankles during
weight-bearing activities.
■■The feet contain a system of arches that displace body weight and dissipate ground reac-

tion forces when they interact with a contact surface. The arches also help to provide
propulsion during the gait cycle.
–– Medial longitudinal arch
–– Lateral longitudinal arch
–– Transverse arch
■■The muscles in the feet and ankles are like bungee cords in that they develop more

tension as they lengthen. This elastic property of muscles enables them to slow down
forces on the foot and ankle joints and to store potential energy to facilitate movement.
■■The Achilles tendon is a strong and resilient soft tissue structure that attaches the

soleus and gastrocnemius muscles to the heel. Tension on the Achilles tendon when the
foot dorsiflexes helps to decelerate forces on the foot and ankle and to generate power
for propulsion.
■■When the muscles and other soft tissue structures of the feet and ankles are healthy and

functioning well, they can help prevent overpronation and lack of dorsiflexion.
