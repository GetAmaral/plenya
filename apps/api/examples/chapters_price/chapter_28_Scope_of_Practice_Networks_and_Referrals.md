# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 28: Scope of Practice, Networks, and Referrals

CHAPTER 28
Scope of Practice,
Networks, and Referrals
As you begin to integrate corrective exercise techniques into your exercise programs, it is extremely
important that the services you offer remain firmly
within your scope of practice as a fitness professional
(Bryant and Green 2010). Working within a clearly
delineated role is beneficial for you and your clients
because it enables you to practice and promote your
specialty skills. It also enables you to build strong
networking relationships with other businesses and
to increase your ability to generate quality client
referrals.

MAINTAINING YOUR SCOPE
OF PRACTICE
While the laws differ among states and countries,
it is universally accepted that professionals must
not work outside the bounds of their experience,
education, training, and demonstrated competencies
(Howley and Thompson 2016). As a fitness professional, your expertise lies in understanding the
musculoskeletal system and how it is influenced by
posture and movement. This specialized knowledge
helps you to recognize clients’ physical limitations
and enables you to design exercise programs to
help them reach their health, movement, and fitness
goals. The integration of corrective exercise into
fitness programming and personal training is a key
to your success and that of your clients (Price and
Bratcher 2010).

As you work, however, it is important not to confuse your role with that of a licensed medical professional. It is never appropriate for you to diagnose,
prescribe for, or treat a specific medical condition
(Bryant and Green 2010). While it is not your job to
be an authority figure on diagnosed conditions or
medical care, it is within your scope of practice to
work with clients to take actions that will improve
their musculoskeletal health (Price and Bratcher
2010).
Maintaining your occupational boundaries can
also benefit your business by enhancing your reputation as a reliable professional (Price and Bratcher
2012). Doctors often require qualified fitness professionals to whom they can refer patients who need
guidance with exercise (DiNubile and Patrick 2005).
Unfortunately, they can be reluctant to refer patients
with musculoskeletal conditions out of a concern
that their clients’ problems might be made worse
by a fitness professional or personal trainer. When
you have specialty qualifications in musculoskeletal
assessment and corrective exercise, and when you
work within your scope of practice, medical professionals will feel confident in sending clients your
way (DiNubile and Patrick 2005).
As you advance in your use of corrective exercise procedures, it is highly recommended that
you obtain The BioMechanics Method Corrective
Exercise Specialist (TBMM-CES) credential. Not
only will this strengthen your skills, but it can also

result in more referrals from medical professionals.
This internationally recognized CES qualification
can lend credibility to your networking efforts. As
your network grows, you will also find it easier to
refer clients to other specialists when their condition
lies beyond your scope of practice.

where Justin talks about the benefits of working within your scope of practice.

DEVELOPING
PROFESSIONAL
NETWORKS AND
REFERRALS
Networking is the creation of strategic business
relationships with licensed medical professionals
and other health and fitness practitioners. When
done well, it can produce a mutually beneficial
referral system of clients and patients (Levinson
and Mann 2007). Networking is one of the least
expensive and most effective ways to market your
business and build your client base. However, successful networking involves more than handing out
business cards or getting others to hand them out for
you. It requires time to cultivate relationships with
selected professionals you trust and who, in turn,
have confidence in you and your business. While
successful networking takes time and energy, the
referrals generated through your network are likely
to be genuine prospects who may become clients
(Price and Bratcher 2012).
Before you begin networking, ask yourself what
you want to get out of your business relationships.
Is your primary goal to connect with other professionals so they will refer clients to you? Or is it to
build a network of professionals to whom you can
refer your own clients for other specialty services?
Perhaps it is a combination of both. Once you have
defined your objectives, you must then identify
appropriate opportunities and partners (Price and
Bratcher 2012).

IDENTIFYING GOOD
NETWORKING
OPPORTUNITIES
There are many ways to meet people with whom
you can network: conversations with current clients,

dinner parties for clients, lunch meetings with other
professionals, community gatherings, social media
sites, and conversations with work colleagues. Some
of these opportunities give you the chance to meet
face-to-face with others to create lasting and productive networking relationships; other, less-structured
meetings are more likely to result in sporadic client
referrals. You must determine which types of networking opportunities are most likely to help you
achieve your objectives. You also must understand
that the key to building networking relationships
lies in the quality, not the quantity, of the events you
attend (Price and Bratcher 2012).

APPROACHING POTENTIAL
NETWORKING PARTNERS
Once you have identified potential referral sources
or networking partners, approach them in a professional manner (Ciletti 2011). You should send
a letter introducing yourself, your business, the
types of services you offer, and how you envision
working together to help their customers or those
clients you share. As with everything else you do
in your business, your letter of introduction and
accompanying materials should present the highquality, expert image you want to portray. Once
you have sent the letter, follow it up immediately
with a telephone call or email to let the prospective
networking partners know it is coming and that
you will follow up soon to answer any questions. Do
not make the mistake of simply contacting people
by email. Many business owners are used to being
solicited this way, and they will often ignore this
type of introduction.
Once the potential networking partners have
received your letter, follow up as promised, gauge
their interest in collaborating, and try to set up a
meeting to introduce yourself in person (Brocato
2010). Do not be discouraged if they do not have
time to meet with you. If they are successful medical
practitioners, they are likely very busy. Your efforts
to make contact and follow up in a timely manner
will still demonstrate your desire to help clients to
reach their goals and they may produce referrals in
the future.
If you can set up a meeting with your target partner, be ready to make the most of that opportunity
by preparing a brief summary about you and your
business. This is crucial for piquing someone’s interest, and it is the first step in developing successful
networking relationships (Knoote-Parke 2009; Price
and Bratcher 2012).


Scope of Practice, Networks, and Referrals

FORMING YOUR SALES PITCH
FOR PROSPECTS

get them interested enough in your services that
the price is not a determining factor in their
decision to refer to you.

The more you prepare and rehearse your business
summary, the more confident and interesting you
and your business will appear to a networking
prospect. While the details of your presentation will
vary according to your audience, the core content
will be the same.

DISTINGUISHING YOURSELF
AS A NETWORKING PARTNER

■■Your business basics: Clearly describe the

primary purpose of your business in one or two
sentences. If the person you are speaking to is
interested and wants to know more, she will
indicate this, and you can expand from there
(Knoote-Parke 2009). Here is an example of the
business basics for a person who owns a personal
training studio that specializes in corrective
exercise for amateur athletes:
“I specialize in helping people overcome musculoskeletal problems and movement limitations
so they can excel in the sporting endeavors
they love.”
A concise, yet descriptive statement such as
this will prompt an interested party to ask more
questions, such as, “Do you have your own facility?” or, “What types of athletes do you help?”
Once they begin asking questions, you will be
able to tell what types of services they want to
hear about, and you can tailor the rest of the
conversation to meet their interests (Price and
Bratcher 2012).
■■Benefits your business provides: A wise
speaker knows that people are typically more
interested in themselves than in what the
speaker has to say. If you can find out a little bit
about networking prospects before talking with
them, you can tie that into your presentation
(Thomas 2014; Bryant, Green, and Newton-Merrill 2013).
■■Add credibility: Always frame your business
in a positive manner to add credibility to your
undertakings, but be careful about making
false claims. Exaggerating your successes
may prompt listeners to end the conversation
(Knoote-Parke 2009). On the other hand, selling
yourself short with statements like, “We only
have…” or “I’ve just started…” can have the
same negative effect (Price and Bratcher 2012).
■■Associated fees: Unless it works to your bene-

fit, or is part of your strategy with a particular
person, avoid discussing prices or costs for
your services when initially meeting potential
networking partners. The aim of the pitch is to

Once you have made headway with your networking pitch, capitalize on your progress. Following are
some strategies that can increase the chances that
targeted professionals will refer clients your way.
■■Skill demonstration: When you meet with

prospective networking or referral sources, have
a strategy to help them remember your unique
skills. When appropriate, demonstrating any of
The BioMechanics Method visual or hands-on
procedures will enable you to showcase your
talents. If it is inappropriate to demonstrate
your skills at that time, give them a certificate
for a complimentary session with you for use at
a future date (Price and Bratcher 2012).
■■Session swap: If you are networking with
professionals who also provide services for
alleviating musculoskeletal conditions—such as
chiropractors, acupuncturists, or massage therapists—offer to exchange sessions. Swapping
sessions with potential partners enables you to
see each other in action, and that can boost your
confidence about having them in your referral
network (Phillips 2014).
■■Offer discounts: Extending a small discount to a
potential networking partner’s clients or patients
may encourage professionals to remember and
refer to you. Their ability to arrange discounts for
your services makes the referring professionals
appear to be doing clients a favor, and it also
helps motivate the potential client to book an
appointment with you (Price and Bratcher 2012).
■■Commissions: While the custom of offering discounts for a network partner’s clients is recommended, offering commissions to the referring
professional is not. This type of arrangement
creates relationships based on monetary gains
instead of mutual respect, and it can affect the
long-term success of the networking arrangement (Price and Bratcher 2012).
■■Web referral page and links: Once you have
established a networking partnership, consider
setting up a Referral Page on your website dedicated exclusively to affiliated health care, medical, and fitness professionals you recommend.
Advertising reputable networking partners can
enhance your own credibility.

403

■■Maintenance: After you have developed a net-

working source, reach out to that person periodically to keep lines of communication open
and referrals forthcoming (Thomas 2014). If it
appears that someone is no longer interested in
working with you, thank them for their valuable
time, and let them know that you are always
available if they need your help in the future.

SOCIAL MEDIA AND
NETWORKING GROUPS
Face-to-face networking is the strongest way to build
your referral streams and business partnerships.
There are, however, a number of business-related
social networking sites, such as LinkedIn, Viadeo,
PartnerUp, and Xing that are designed for building
professional networks online. These sites enable
users to invite and endorse other professionals
(Phillips 2014). However, these sites lack the individual touch that is vital to developing successful
professional networks; they should only be used as
an adjunct to more personal networking strategies.
While social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are valuable for advertising and marketing your
business, they are not recommended for developing
reliable referral networks.
Similar to online networking, opportunities exist
to join professional networking groups set up by a
third party or networking organization. This type of
networking alliance consists of professionals from
different areas who agree to refer to each other so
that the members of the group can mutually benefit
(Thomas 2014). This type of prearranged referral
system can work well for some people. However,

these types of networking groups are open to virtually anyone, and the caliber of professionals in them
can vary greatly. In rare cases, joining such a group
where certain members have a poor standing in the
community may actually harm your own business
reputation.

NETWORKING
WITH YOUR CLIENTS
Professional networking relationships are needed in
order to generate quality referrals from outside of
your business. If your company is established and
you have a solid client base, one of the best ways
to increase referrals is to solicit them from satisfied clients (Blakemore 2011). Following are some
strategies for networking with existing customers.
■■Use gift certificates: All of your clients will know

someone with aches and pains, and your skills
will be in high demand if you can get in front of
those people. Encourage current clients to make
these referrals by providing them with a gift
certificate for a complimentary assessment or
session to pass on to someone they think might
like to see you (Fisher 2001). Asking clients to
pass on the certificate is an easy way to motivate
them to refer business to you, but be careful not
to give away too many gift certificates because
this will devalue your services.
■■Homework for a client’s friend, family, or
colleague: Giving clients an opportunity to use
the knowledge they are gaining about corrective
exercise to help their friends, family members,
or colleagues is another great way to generate

Creating Professional Networks and Referrals: Keys to Success
• Some people think the best salespeople

are also the best talkers. On the
contrary, the best salespeople are the
best listeners. The more you listen to
potential networking partners, the more
you will learn about them, and the better
you will be able to tailor your networking
spiel to appeal to their interests.

• Every networking opportunity is

different. People respond differently to
different approaches, so be prepared to
be flexible in your networking pitch.

• Building a solid professional networking
and referral platform takes a lot of time

and effort. It may require many hours
of work, and it may take months before
you start to see developments in terms
of referrals. Be patient, and continually
work on fostering constructive
networking relationships.

• There is a common tenet in the

business world about networking and
referrals: People refer to people they
know and trust. Keeping the lines
of communication open with your
networking partners is the best way
to generate solid referrals and build
trusted business relationships.


Scope of Practice, Networks, and Referrals

referrals (Burg 2006). Imagine, for instance,
that you are teaching your client a stretch she
can do for her calf muscles to help alleviate
soreness after running. As you are teaching
her the exercise, she mentions that her husband
also gets the same pain after he plays a round
of golf. When you review the client’s corrective
exercise homework at the end of the session, ask
if she thinks her husband would be interested
in doing a couple of exercises to help eliminate
his calf pain. If she is agreeable, provide a
couple of general exercises, like a calf massage
and stretch, that she could show her husband
to perform before and after he plays golf. Write
the information for the husband on a piece of
letterhead paper (or other professional-looking materials that you have developed for this
purpose), and tell your client her husband can
give you a call if he has any questions about
the exercises.
■■Invite people to observe: You can also generate
new referrals through your current clients by
inviting their friends, family members, medical
professionals, and other associates to observe
their sessions with you (Aluise 1980). Often,

these people will want to see what the client is
doing that is working so well.
■■Network with your client’s health care providers: You can expand and strengthen your
professional networks by including a client’s
health care providers in your dealings with
that client. For example, if a client returns after
a period of absence due to illness or injury,
ask who his doctor is, and ask whether you
can contact that person to see if there is any
additional input that can help you to provide
better service for your client. Your client will
appreciate the extra effort, and you will benefit
from the knowledge you gain from speaking to
the doctor (as well as developing a potential
referral source). You can use this strategy for
any type of health professional your clients
use. Building networks with other health and
medical professionals is a lot easier if you both
share a customer to act as the point of reference
(Price and Bratcher 2012).
Go to the online video and watch video 28.2,
where Justin talks about how to network with
the medical profession.

Review of Key Points
Creating referrals through professional networks and client-generated leads is necessary to
ensure a steady stream of customers. Staying within your scope of practice and developing
strategic networking relationships can help boost your professional standing in the industry
and can enhance your reputation for helping people with musculoskeletal dysfunctions.
■■Before you begin networking or cultivating referral sources, develop a concise presen-

tation that highlights your business. Once you have developed the basic presentation,
tailor it to particular audiences as needed.
■■There are many strategies for setting up an initial meeting or encouraging a potential

networking source to refer business, such as exchanging services and offering discounts
or gift certificates for their clients.
■■Providing current clients with gift certificates for their friends, family members, or

colleagues, encouraging them to invite guests to attend their sessions, and suggesting
corrective exercise homework for people they know may encourage new client referrals.
■■Keeping in contact with other health professionals and following up on networking or

referral opportunities can help you to develop successful professional networks.
■■Productive networking takes time and effort. Treat networking as an ongoing business

requirement, and devote time to it regularly.

Self-Check
It is important to introduce yourself to potential networking partners in a professional way.
Use the following prompts to draft a letter you can send to other practitioners to acquaint
them with you and your services, with the goal of setting up a mutually beneficial referral
network.

Your business name/logo
Your business address
Recipient’s name and address
Dear ______________________,
This first paragraph should pique your readers’ attention so they continue to read
the letter. For example:
How many of your patients complain of recurring muscle and joint pain? Are
these problems affecting their daily lives, thwarting their ability to exercise
regularly, or preventing the achievement of their health and fitness goals?
Who do you turn to for assistance in helping patients with these problems?
Use the second paragraph to introduce yourself, and explain how your services
meet the needs you have identified.
The third paragraph should briefly describe in more detail what you do specifically
to meet these needs (e.g., use a methodical approach to identify musculoskeletal
imbalances that are either causing or contributing to movement and muscle
dysfunction; the strategic application of individualized corrective exercise
programs; the appropriate referral of clients to like-minded professionals
when a condition is encountered that might require additional assistance).
The final paragraph should thank recipients for their time and let them know that
you will be contacting them soon to discuss their needs further and to explore
potential networking opportunities.

base of the spine between the lumbar spine and the
coccyx (tailbone).
scapula—A broad, flat bone that sits on the back of the
upper rib cage, forming the back of the shoulder girdle.
Also referred to as the shoulder blade.
scope of practice—The boundaries of a professional’s
experience, education, training, and demonstrated
competencies.
self-myofascial release—A form of self-massage used
to restore and rejuvenate soft tissues that have become
adversely affected by chronic musculoskeletal imbalances.
shoulder joint—The part of the shoulder girdle where
the humerus articulates with the scapula via the glenoid. Also called the glenohumeral joint. The three
other joints that make up the shoulder girdle are the
acromioclavicular, scapulothoracic and sternoclavicular joints.
side-to-side alignment— Alignment of the femur and
tibia and the movement and position of these bones in
relation to the centerline of the body.
single-joint strengthening—A type of exercise used
to strengthen muscles that move one joint at a time.
skull—The bony structure consisting of the cranium
and the mandible that provides the general framework
for the head.
sternum—A T-shaped bone at the top and center of
the front of the rib cage to which the clavicles and rib
bones attach.

rationale—The reason for recommending the inclusion
of an exercise or strategy in a client’s corrective exercise program based on her assessment results, needs,
and goals.

strengthening—A type of exercise used to fortify specific soft tissue structures (e.g., muscles) and reeducate
the body so it can move more effectively and efficiently.

referral—A client or potential client who is obtained as
a direct result of a recommendation or endorsement by
another party.

stretching—A type of exercise used to increase the
flexibility of the muscles and fascia and to increase the
range of motion of the joints.

regression—A return to an earlier exercise or technique
that is easier for a client to perform.

structural assessment—A verbal, visual, and hands-on
evaluation process used to gain insight into a person’s
musculoskeletal condition before creating a program of
corrective exercise.

rib cage—The rib cage is formed by 24 bones (12 on each
side of the thoracic spine) that attach to the sternum at
the front of the chest and to the sides of each thoracic
vertebra at the back (the bottom two sets of ribs do
not attach to the sternum). These bones form a ringlike structure that protects the organs in the mid- and
upper torso and increase the size of the torso, providing
a greater surface area for muscles and other soft tissues
to attach.
sacroiliac joint—A main joint of the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle where the sacrum meets the ilium of the pelvis.
There is a left and a right sacroiliac joint.
sacrotuberous ligament—A band of connective tissue
that spans from the base of the sacrum to the ischial

subtalar joint—A joint in the ankle located beneath
the talus bone that transfers forces forward and across
the foot.
SWOT analysis—A tool commonly used in the development of marketing plans to assess a business’s potential
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
talus bone—A bone near the bottom of the ankle that
helps connect the lower leg to the foot.
temporomandibular joint (TMJ)—One of the most
important joints in the neck and head area, formed
where the mandible (i.e., jawbone) articulates with the
temporal bone of the cranium.

Glossary

tendon—A flexible, yet tough connective tissue that
attaches muscle to bone.
thoracic spine—The part of the spine between the
lumbar and cervical segments consisting of 12 vertebrae
in the middle and upper torso area.
thoracolumbar fascia—Layers of fascia on the back of
the torso that connect many of the ligaments and big
muscles of the lower back, pelvis, and rib cage. Also
referred to as the lumbodorsal fascia.
tibia—The wide shin bone on the medial side of the
lower leg.
tibiofibular joint—The joint where the tibia and fibula
come together at the ankle.
tracking problems of the knee—A common musculoskeletal imbalance of the knee characterized by an
inability of the patella to glide smoothly over the end of
the femur during knee flexion and extension.
tragus—The fleshy piece of skin that covers part of the
opening at the front of the ear.
transverse arches—A series of small dome-shaped
arches that run from side to side across the foot just
behind the toes.

true ankle joint—The joint below the lower leg bones
and above the talus bone that helps the lower leg to
interact with the foot and ankle and helps displace
stress to the heel.
valgus knee position or displacement—A common
musculoskeletal imbalance of the knee characterized
by the knee collapsing too far in toward the midline of
the body.
value proposition statement—A marketing strategy
used to state the aims and objectives of a business in
terms of the unique value those elements offer clients
or customers.
verbal assessment—The first part of the structural
assessment process used to acquire relevant health
history information as it relates to a client’s musculoskeletal well-being.
visual and hands-on assessment—The portion of
the structural assessment process used to visually and
manually inspect each major area of a client’s body for
the presence of musculoskeletal imbalances.
