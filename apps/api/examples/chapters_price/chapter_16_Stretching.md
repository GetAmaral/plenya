## Chapter 16: Stretching

CHAPTER 16
Stretching
In this chapter you will learn how to progress a
client’s corrective exercise program from self-myofascial release by introducing stretching exercises.
You will learn about various types of stretches and
how they can be used to retrain, rehabilitate, and
increase range of motion in those structures that
have been hindered by musculoskeletal imbalances.
You will also learn teaching and cueing tips to help
you communicate these strategies to clients, and you
will learn procedures for progressing and regressing
these techniques as required.

WHAT IS STRETCHING?
Skeletal structures that have been chronically out of
alignment can cause joints to become irritated and
inflamed. In response to this inflammation, muscles
and other soft tissue structures may tighten up or
stiffen around a joint to prevent movement and to
protect it from further injury or pain. Over time,
these chronically tight muscles lose their ability
to contract, stretch, and relax, which not only prevents movement locally, but also restricts motion in
surrounding areas (Clark and Lucett 2011; Kovacs
2015). These chronically irritated or tight muscles
limit function and can cause additional musculoskeletal imbalances as the body compensates for lack of
movement. Chronically irritated muscles may also
develop restrictions, nodules, or scar tissue that can
cause additional pain (Rolf 1989).
Stretching is the process of elongating and
lengthening muscle fibers (and their accompanying
tendons and fascia) in order to restore blood flow,
recondition or retrain deconditioned or injured
tissues, and promote soft tissue elasticity (Karageanes 2005). The regular application of stretching

can help break the cycle of protection created by
irritated muscles by retraining them to contract,
lengthen, and relax effectively. Stretching is also
an ideal way to safely introduce range of movement
to the body and to restore areas that have been
adversely affected by musculoskeletal imbalances
(Kovacs 2015).
Stretching involves moving parts of the body in
directions that mimic the way those areas should
move when they are working correctly. When performed properly, stretches not only improve the
health and condition of the body, but they also reeducate the nervous system about the right way to move
(Clark and Lucett 2011). In this regard, stretching
(when combined with a program of self-myofascial
release) helps set the stage for progressing the musculoskeletal, myofascial, and neuromuscular systems
into the strengthening phase of a corrective exercise
program (Price and Bratcher 2010).

ORIGINS OF STRETCHING
The use of stretching to increase range of motion,
improve health, and alleviate pain has been around
for centuries. The ancient Chinese are thought to
have been the first civilization to have developed and
used a regular program of exercise comprised mainly
of stretching (known as kung fu) (Calvert 2002). The
benefits of stretching were also touted throughout
ancient India through the practices of yoga.
Today stretching is a standard practice used to
improve athletic performance, increase range of
motion, help the body recover and regenerate following an injury, prepare the body for exercise, help
the body recuperate after strenuous activity, prevent
injury, and decrease pain (Hyde 2002).

BENEFITS OF STRETCHING
There are many documented reasons why it is beneficial to include stretching exercises in corrective
exercise programs. Regular stretching, when done
properly, has been shown to do the following (Clark
and Lucett 2011; Hyde 2002; Karageanes 2005; Price
and Bratcher 2010):
■■Helps restore the normal pattern of movement

for a muscle or group of muscles
■■Increases range of motion
■■Increases muscular strength and power output
■■Helps prevent muscle injury
■■Diminishes muscle tightness or spasms
■■Enhances general relaxation
■■Improves muscle coordination
■■Retrains the nervous system to “let go” of exces-

sive tension in a muscle or body part

TYPES OF STRETCHES
There are a number of different types of stretches.
The three most widely used techniques for addressing musculoskeletal imbalances are
1. passive stretching,
2. active stretching, and
3. dynamic stretching.
Each technique offers a unique benefit to clients as
they prepare for the next stage of their corrective
exercise programs or exercise sessions.

PASSIVE STRETCHING
Passive, or static, stretching involves holding a fixed
position (with assistance from something like your
hand, a wall, the ground, or another person) for a

Figure 16.1

predetermined amount of time to increase range
of movement around a joint or joints (Kovacs 2015;
Walker 2011). Other areas of the body are not being
stimulated to contract, stabilize, or coordinate movement in a passive stretch, and they are therefore
in a passive or relaxed state (Ackland, Elliott, and
Bloomfield 2009). An example of a passive stretch
would be the Lying Quadriceps Stretch, which
involves stretching the quadriceps group of muscles
of one leg while lying down and holding that position
(see figure 16.1). This type of controlled stretching
is typically introduced in the beginning of a corrective stretching program because it allows a client to
feel safe, introducing new ranges of motion without
the need to control other areas of the body or to
experience anxiety about a new required movement.

ACTIVE STRETCHING
Active stretches are based on a concept known as
reciprocal inhibition, which is the notion that as
one muscle or muscle group contracts to create a
movement, its opposing muscle or muscle group is
inhibited from contracting to allow the movement to
happen (Muscolino 2009). For example, contracting
the gluteus maximus muscle inhibits the hip flexor
muscles, allowing them to lengthen so that the hips
can extend more effectively (see figure 16.2). Unlike
passive stretching, which involves no conscious
contraction of a muscle, active stretching requires
the target muscles to be maintained in a stretched
position while the opposing muscle(s) contract
(Muscolino 2009).
It is crucial to develop a thorough understanding of anatomy so you can identify which muscle
or muscle groups need to contract in order for the
opposing group to stretch. Take, for example, the
Hip Flexor Stretch just described. You should know
that the hip flexors contract to help flex the hip. You
should also know that the gluteus maximus muscle

The Lying Quadriceps Stretch is an example of a passive stretch.


Stretching

performs the opposing movement (i.e., it contracts
to help extend the hips) (Golding and Golding 2003).
Therefore, contracting the gluteus maximus during a
Hip Flexor Stretch will help the hip flexors to relax,
promoting a better stretch.
If you do not yet feel confident in your knowledge
of muscular anatomy and movement, spend some
additional time reviewing the information provided
in part II. As your knowledge of anatomy and movement deepens, your ability to select effective exercises for clients will greatly improve.
Active stretching also provides an excellent
way to progress from passive stretching because it
teaches the client how to coordinate movement by
simultaneously lengthening and contracting muscles
that facilitate motion in the target joint (Price and
Bratcher 2010). Active stretching also helps retrain
the nervous system to relax and allow the undisrupted movement of a previously injured or painful
part. Active stretches also prepare the body for the
performance of more dynamic stretching movements and activities.

The term dynamic can be somewhat misleading,
however, as these types of stretches do not necessarily incorporate vigorous, uncontrolled movements
as the name suggests. Rather, they are designed
to emphasize precise and controlled movements
that encourage a greater, or more dynamic, range
of motion (Walker 2011). These types of stretches
integrate the correct movement of individual parts
(that a client has previously learned by performing passive and active stretches for those areas)
into coordinated, functional movements involving
many body parts (Alter 1998). Dynamic stretching
is the ultimate stage of a stretching program and
is ideal for transitioning clients to strengthening
exercises or preparing the body for sports and other
recreational pursuits. Since these types of stretches
require the whole body to work together to stabilize,
control, accelerate, and decelerate movement, many
dynamic stretches are also considered strengthening exercises.
To avoid possible injury during a dynamic stretch,
never tell a client to use bouncing or jerky movements
to force muscles or joints beyond a comfortable range
of motion. Furthermore, do not instruct clients to
perform additional repetitions when they become
overly fatigued or cannot maintain correct form.
An example of a dynamic stretch would be adding
a torso rotation to an active stretch such as the Hamstring Stretch (see figure 16.3). You would create this
dynamic stretch by coaching the client to perform a

DYNAMIC STRETCHING
Dynamic, or integrated, stretches are used to mimic
or introduce everyday movements and functional
activities to a client’s corrective exercise program
(Kovacs 2015; Walker 2011). These types of stretches
improve dynamic flexibility and enable clients to
reach greater ranges of motion by gradually increasing the extent or speed of the movements they are
performing (Kurz 2003).

Figure 16.3 The Hamstring Stretch with
torso rotation is an example of
a dynamic stretch.

number of torso rotations while stabilizing the pelvis
over the standing leg. This modification would result
in an exercise that would stretch the hamstrings
while strengthening the stabilizing muscles of the
buttocks, hips, standing leg, and obliques (muscles
that rotate the torso).

TEACHING TIPS FOR
STRETCHING EXERCISES
It is important to thoroughly understand muscles
and their functions so that you can identify which
soft tissue structures you are stretching and what
movements those muscles achieve. This will help
you to teach clients how to perform the stretch correctly, where they should feel the stretch, and how
to regress, progress, or adjust a stretch to make it
more appropriate or effective.
When teaching stretching techniques, consider the
following to ensure the successful implementation of
these types of exercises into a client’s program:
1. Some clients may believe that stretches must be
held for long periods to be effective. However,
that is not necessarily the case. Research shows
that holding a stretch for more than 60 seconds
generally produces no greater range of motion
than holding a stretch for 30 to 60 seconds
(Bandy, Irion, and Briggler 1997; Taylor et al.
2011). Additionally, injuries, adhesions, scars,
tears, and muscle fatigue can affect a person’s
ability to perform or hold a stretch. Therefore,
while general guidelines are provided in chapter
20 for each exercise, the physical capabilities of
each client will ultimately determine how long
and how often a stretch should be performed.
2. Always tell clients where they should feel a
stretching sensation as they perform a stretching exercise. Knowing where they should feel a
stretch serves several purposes. It enables clients to monitor their own stretching programs,
reduces the potential for injury or harm when
they are performing stretches on their own,
increases their intrinsic motivation, and helps
them to progress their stretching programs
more quickly (Price and Bratcher 2010). For
example, when stretching the piriformis muscle
(see Piriformis Stretch in chapter 20), a client
should feel the stretch across the back of the
buttocks from the base of the spine to the outside of the hip (because the piriformis muscle
originates at the sacrum, travels across the back
of the hip, and attaches to the outside of the top
of the upper leg) (Gray 1995).

However, if while doing this stretch the
client experiences a weird sensation in his
groin area (which is a common problem if this
stretch is performed incorrectly), you would
need to review his technique and adjust it
accordingly. If you cannot adjust his form to
target the piriformis muscle correctly, instruct
the client to regress to a self-myofascial release
exercise for that specific area. After the appropriate muscles have been massaged, when you
return to the Piriformis Stretch, you will find
that the area has released, and the client can
now perform the stretch correctly, feeling it
in the right area of his body. Communicating
with clients about where they feel the stretch
provides you with vital information about their
progress, encourages greater client participation and feedback, improves their technique,
and ensures program success.
3. As with any exercise recommendation, it is
important to give clients a detailed rationale
for why you are including specific stretching
exercises in their programs. The sound reasoning behind your recommendations, linked to
clients’ assessment results, will increase their
motivation to perform the exercises. Highlight
how a given exercise will improve certain
deviations and imbalances, or describe how
performing a particular stretching exercise
will release the muscles or tissues enough to
enable them to progress to more challenging
stretches or strengthening exercises. These
communication strategies help involve clients in
the exercise design process and motivate them
to participate fully in their programs (Bandura
1986; Mason 2004).
4. Recommending appropriate and effective
stretching exercises prepares clients for progression to the advanced challenges posed by
strengthening exercises. The use of carefully
selected stretching exercises also gives you
an opportunity to build clients’ confidence
in moving and coordinating their bodies.
This will help them feel optimistic about
trying some of the more complex movements
required in the strengthening portion of their
programs.

WHEN TO REGRESS
STRETCHES
It is important for clients to be successful at performing the stretching exercises you recommend,
both when under your supervision and when com-


Stretching

pleting them on their own. Therefore, you should
know when it is appropriate to regress these types
of exercises.
1. Always regress a stretching exercise if a client
experiences pain or discomfort. If a muscle or
group of tissues is not yet ready to be stretched,
or has not been prepared adequately in
advance, the joint associated with the muscles
you are trying to stretch may experience strain
or stress during the exercise. If a client indicates that a certain joint or area hurts when
she performs the stretch, then either regress
to a more subtle stretch or regress further to a
self-myofascial release technique. Never persist
with any stretch if a client indicates that it is
painful (Clark and Lucett 2011).
2. Regress a stretching exercise if a client has
difficulty performing the exercise correctly
or remaining in control of the movement. For
example, a client may struggle to remember
all the key points of an exercise if there are
too many components to it, or he may not be
able to perform the movement properly. If this
is the case, regress the stretch until the client
can perform the movement completely and
correctly.
3. Many standing or kneeling stretches require
clients to stabilize their bodies during the exercise. However, if clients have trouble balancing
during a stretch, regress the movement so they

for the Quadriceps Stretch.

can maintain balance and concentrate on the
key points of the exercise itself.
4. Regress a stretching exercise if a client indicates that the equipment needs for the exercise
are not practical. A stretch that requires the
use of a specialized piece of equipment (like a
specific stretching band or strap), for example,
may affect the client’s ability to perform that
exercise regularly at home if she does not have
that piece of equipment.

WAYS TO REGRESS
STRETCHES
There are many ways to regress a stretching exercise:
1. Allow clients to use a balance aid to assist with
the movement (see figure 16.4).
2. Instruct a client to perform the exercise while
sitting or lying down. For example, the Hamstring Stretch can be performed while lying
down (see figure 16.5), and the Lower Back
Stretch (both of these are described in chapter
20) can be regressed by coaching the client to
lie on her back and hug her knees to her chest.

Figure 16.5 Performing a stretch while lying
down is a way to regress it.

3. Regress a stretching exercise by revisiting a
self-myofascial release exercise that will prepare the client to perform a stretching exercise
more precisely. For example, if a client has pain
in the front of the ankle or around the Achilles
tendon during the Calf Stretch, regress to the
Calf Massage (see figure 16.6). Then when you
return to the Calf Stretch, the calf muscles will
be better able to lengthen and will not place
excessive stress on the ankle or on the Achilles tendon.
There are many different possibilities for regressing
stretching exercises. Additional ideas and suggestions for regressions can be found in chapter 20,
Stretching Exercises.

WHEN TO PROGRESS
STRETCHES
Clients will want to make quick progress so they
can move on to the strengthening portion of their
programs. Knowing when and how to progress their
stretching programs will help them to do this as
soon as possible.
1. When clients have demonstrated that they
can perform a stretch correctly (and regularly
integrate that stretch into their daily routines)
but are no longer seeing a benefit, progress to
a more complex or dynamic stretch that integrates other parts of the body (Walker 2011).
2. Progress to a dynamic stretch that incorporates
several areas of the body targeted with passive

or active stretches as soon as a client has mastered those stretches, especially if the client
says that the stretching program has become
too time consuming (Price and Bratcher 2010).
3. If the desired range of motion and technique
for a stretching exercise have been achieved,
progress the exercise by introducing a strengthening component for the muscle or soft tissue
structures being targeted.
4. When a client has demonstrated mastery of an
exercise and is no longer experiencing progress,
it is time to move on in the corrective exercise
program.

WAYS TO PROGRESS
STRETCHES
There are many ways to progress a stretching
exercise:
1. Progress a stretch by telling the client to activate the opposite muscle (the antagonist) to the
one being stretched (refer to the information
on Active Stretching earlier in this chapter).
For example, when a client is stretching her
hamstrings, coach her to actively contract her
quadriceps to produce a greater stretch in her
hamstrings (Muscolino 2009).
2. Coach a client to move from a seated or kneeling stretch to a standing version of the same
stretch. For example, progressing the seated
Lower Back Stretch (see chapter 20) to a standing version (see figure 16.7) not only stretches

Figure 16.6 Regressing to a self-myofascial release technique from a stretching exercise.


Stretching

the muscles and soft tissue structures of the
lower back but integrates the hamstrings as
well (Myers 2008).
3. Progress a stretch by removing a balance aid.
For example, if a client places his hand on a
foam roller for balance when performing the
Quadriceps Stretch, remove the foam roller so
he begins to strengthen the muscles of the leg
that he is balancing on. However, you should
never remove a balance aid if your client needs
it to perform the exercise correctly or if the
client does not feel confident performing the
exercise without it.
4. Integrate additional areas of the body into a
stretching exercise (refer to the information

on Dynamic Stretching earlier in this chapter).
For example, if a client has reached a suitable
level of proficiency with the Calf Stretch, Hip
Flexor Stretch, and Door Frame Stretch (see
chapter 20), progress to a dynamic movement
such as a Step Back with Arm Raise (see figure
16.8), which stretches the calf, hip flexors, and
muscles of the trunk and torso to address the
function of the entire lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
(McGill 2002).
There are many different possibilities for progressing stretching exercises. Additional ideas and suggestions can be found in chapter 20, Stretching
Exercises.

Figure 16.7 Moving from a seated to a standing stretch is a progression.

is ready.

WHEN NOT TO USE
STRETCHING EXERCISES
Stretching exercises are an incredibly beneficial
and generally safe method for introducing movement to a client’s program. However, following are
some specific contraindications for the application
of stretching exercises in a corrective exercise
setting (Clark and Lucett 2011; Karageanes 2005;
Kisner and Colby 2012; Price and Bratcher 2010).
■■Discontinue stretching if a client complains of

sharp pain in or around the target area.
■■Do not stretch the soft tissue or muscles

around a fracture site or broken bone that is
still healing.
■■Do not use stretching exercises around joints
that are hypermobile or have sustained trauma
(e.g., a dislocated shoulder, a labral tear).
■■Do not stretch muscles or soft tissues that have
recently sustained an acute injury like a tear
or where bruising is present.
■■Do not use stretching exercises around a joint
that is acutely inflamed.
■■Use stretching cautiously with clients who
have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis.
■■Use stretching cautiously with clients who
have a history of anticoagulant drug use.
■■Use stretching cautiously with clients who
currently use or have a history of steroid use.
■■Do not recommend or use vigorous stretching
exercises immediately following an injury or
surgery.
■■Obtain clearance from a physician before
stretching clients with paralysis or chronic
neuromuscular diseases.

ADDITIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS
Here are a few more safety and conditioning tips to
be aware of as you incorporate stretching exercises
into clients’ corrective exercise programs:
1. Stretching is used to facilitate the gradual
lengthening of tissues, increase range of
motion, and encourage the repositioning
of the joints surrounded by those tissues

being stretched. It is important to use gentle
stretches. Ballistic stretching that involves
bouncing or pulsing into a stretch may
cause further injury to clients with chronic
or extreme musculoskeletal issues (Walker
2011).
2. Muscles and tissues in areas of the body
that are tight or restricted may not be willing (or able) to lengthen and stretch. These
restricted muscles or soft tissue structures
may need to be tight in order to protect an
injured or dysfunctional part (Micheli 2011).
If you persist with trying to stretch chronically restricted muscles or tissues, or if you
try to mobilize a joint that is inflamed or
injured, the muscles surrounding that area
may tighten even further to protect the parts
from moving, possibly risking further injury.
You must understand the protective mechanisms of muscles and soft tissue structures,
and this applies to all clients with chronic
malalignment issues. When you recommend stretching exercises to a client with
longstanding musculoskeletal issues, it is
crucial to introduce stretching and movement
gradually. This will reduce the risk that some
areas will tighten up even further.
3. Passive stretches can bolster client confidence because they are relatively easy to
perform, and they present a low injury risk.
While this may seem ideal, this increased
confidence can sometimes prompt clients to
overdo passive stretches. Overstretching can
damage muscle tissue and lead to excessive
muscle soreness the following day, so teach
clients not to overdo their passive stretching
program, no matter how good they feel when
performing the stretches (Alter 1998).
4. It is very important to thoroughly warm up
the muscles and tissues to be stretched before
instructing clients to begin their stretching
programs (Bryant and Green 2010). The use
of self-myofascial release techniques can help
increase the core temperature of tissues prior
to stretching. You can also suggest to clients
that they take a warm bath or shower to help
them warm up adequately before engaging in
their stretching programs at home.
5. The body’s soft tissues contain a lot of water,
and their function and performance depend


Stretching

on adequate hydration. Clients must be well
hydrated before beginning any portion of
their corrective exercise program, and they
must remain hydrated during and after
exercise (Hoffman 2014). Clients who are

dehydrated (e.g., from drinking too much
alcohol the night before or from having been
in the heat for too long before exercising)
may need to delay their exercise until they
can adequately rehydrate.

Review of Key Points
Stretching exercises should be introduced into a client’s program after the successful application of self-myofascial release techniques. Stretching exercises are designed to safely
introduce range of motion to dysfunctional or previously injured parts of a client’s body.
■■Three types of stretches are described in this chapter: passive, active, and dynamic.

Passive stretches are a safe and controlled way of introducing range of motion at the
initial stages of a stretching program. Active stretches are a means of progressing a client’s stretching program by integrating the contraction of an opposing muscle group as
the target muscle is stretched. Dynamic stretches involve stretching (and coordinating)
multiple areas of the body at once, and they represent the ultimate stage of a client’s
stretching program.
■■A sound understanding of functional anatomy will help you to select appropriate stretch-

ing exercises and enable you to teach clients where they should feel each stretch.
■■There are many documented benefits to integrating stretching exercises into a client’s

corrective exercise program. However, you should always be cautious. Chronic musculoskeletal dysfunction or imbalances may affect the manner in which your client can safely
accept increases in range of motion to areas of their bodies that have been dysfunctional
(or in pain) for some time.
■■There are many ways to progress and regress the stretching components of a client’s

corrective exercise program. Pay careful attention to clients as they perform the exercises to make sure they will be able to do them correctly on their own. If you foresee any
difficulties with an exercise, regress it or use another exercise.
