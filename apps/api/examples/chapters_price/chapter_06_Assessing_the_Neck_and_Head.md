## Chapter 6: Assessing the Neck and Head

CHAPTER 6
Assessing the Neck
and Head
The weight of the human head is typically between
9 and 12 pounds. It accounts for about 8 percent of
the average person’s body mass (Louw 2007). Head
position affects the alignment of the musculoskeletal
system all the way down to the toes because the
body must be constantly adjusting to keep the head
balanced. When the head moves too far forward,
the effect is significant. When the head moves even
one inch ahead of the body’s center of gravity, for
example, its effective weight for the rest of the body
doubles (Eriksen 2004). Therefore, optimal alignment of the neck and head complex is essential for
whole-body musculoskeletal health.

BASIC ANATOMY
The neck and head comprise the cervical spine and
the skull (see figure 6.1). The skull provides the
general framework for the head and has two main
components: the cranium and the mandible. The
cranium contains several bones held together by
sutures, or immobile joints. The bones that make
up the cranium include the occipital, two parietal
bones, two temporal bones, the frontal, the sphenoid,
and the ethmoid (Adds and Shahsavari 2012). The
mandible, also known as the jawbone, is connected
to the cranium via the temporomandibular joint.
The skull sits on top of the atlas bone, which is the
first vertebra of the cervical spine (C1). The cervical spine, also known as the neck, has seven small
vertebrae and a mild lordotic curve that arches the
neck backward to help keep the head upright and
the eyes level (Clippinger 2007). As the head moves

forward, backward, and from side to side, the neck
moves accordingly, communicating with the head
through a complex system of nerves, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fasciae.

COMMON DEVIATIONS
There are two main deviations that can cause pain,
injury, and movement dysfunction in the neck and
head (Muscolino 2011):

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

When in perfect alignment, the head should be
naturally balanced atop the spine, torso, and lower
body. A forward position of the head refers to a
projection of the head that places it too far forward
of the body’s plumb line or center. The farther
the head moves forward of the thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle, the more the neck has to arch (or
the head has to tip up and back) to keep the eyes
level (Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998). A malaligned
head position can disrupt the entire musculoskeletal
system, as well as sensory systems such as the eyes
and ears (Jones 2011).
The cervical spine naturally contains a slight
lordotic curve. Excessive cervical lordosis refers
to an increased curvature of the neck that accompanies a forward head position. Excessive cervical
lordosis is problematic because it can compress discs
or nerves in the neck and cause pain or dysfunction
in this area, as well as in the upper torso, head, and
arms (Kendall, McCreary, and Provance 2005).

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Having reviewed the structural anatomy of the neck
and head and the common imbalances clients are
likely to have in this area, we can now proceed to
the detailed assessment procedures.

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
When assessing the neck and head, it is important
to learn how clients perceive their condition, both
in isolation and in relation to other body areas and
when performing activities. Ask about the following
topics, and write down any pertinent information on
the Client Assessment Diagram (CAD).
1. Ask if the client has ever experienced pain,
headaches, or tension in the neck or head, and
ask about the specific location and nature of
the pain (Petty and Moore 2002). For example,
many people suffer headaches as a result of
muscle tension that compresses nerves in
the neck and shoulder. Corrective exercises
can help alleviate headaches caused by this
problem.
2. Ask whether the client has arthritis or any other
diagnosed condition that may affect the musculoskeletal health of the neck and head. For
example, a client with a diagnosis of arthritis in
the facet joints of the neck (joints between the
vertebrae) may experience pain and dysfunction that could affect the success of a corrective
exercise program (Shen and Shaffrey 2010).

Knowing about such conditions may give you
an opportunity to network with other health
care providers to manage the issues.
3. Ask about the client’s past injuries or surgeries.
For example, a fusion of two or more cervical
vertebrae may affect movements and functions
and program design (Petty and Moore 2002).
4. Ask about the client’s level of physical activity.
Ask whether he plays sports, and if so, which
ones? Someone who rides a bicycle for exercise may have significant stresses on his neck
because he must round his shoulders over the
handlebars while his neck arches backward to
keep his eyes focused ahead (Petty and Moore
2002).
5. Ask about the client’s occupation. Does the
client sit for prolonged periods in front of a
computer? If so, where is the monitor in relation
to where he sits—for instance, must he look
sideways to see it? Does the job require him to
look down a lot, bend over a table, or look over
his shoulder for sustained periods? Over time,
repetitive work positions can lead to shoulder,
back, and neck pain (Price and Bratcher 2010).
6. Ask whether neck or head pain ever prevents
the client from engaging in an activity or limits
what he can do. This will highlight the activities
he feels he is missing out on, and it will help
you to understand his underlying motivation for
seeking your help (Price and Bratcher 2010).
7. Ask if the client’s pain coincides with any
other pains or symptoms. This will ultimately
progress both parties’ understanding of the
body’s interconnectedness and will help you
to identify causes and solutions for the person’s
musculoskeletal issues. For example, a client
who experiences headaches after standing
for many hours may also notice that this pain
coincides with lower back pain and her choice to
wear high-heeled shoes. You can then teach her
about how her choice of footwear can affect the
position of her lower back and neck and cause
pain (Price and Bratcher 2010).
8. Ask the client what aggravates his condition and what makes it feel better (Petty and
Moore 2002). For example, if a client tells you
that sitting and watching television makes his
neck pain worse, you can coach him on how to
improve his posture when seated (see chapter
18, Static Postural Considerations).
9. Ask whether the client’s pain ever makes
sleeping difficult. For example, if a client tells


Assessing the Neck and Head

you that sleeping on her stomach makes her
neck pain worse, you can coach her on how to
improve her sleeping posture (see chapter 18,
Static Postural Considerations) to help address
this problem (Price and Bratcher 2010).
10. Ask the client if his pain increases with stress or
if he is currently under a lot of stress. Chronic
stress responses, such as gritting or grinding
the teeth, can cause headaches, tension, and
jaw pain, and it can affect the alignment of
the neck and head. The temporomandibular
joint can also be affected by alignment issues
in the neck and head as a result of chronic
stress, which can manifest as painful popping
or grinding when a person opens or closes his
jaw (Grimsby and Rivard 2008).
Once you have concluded the verbal portion of
the assessment process, move on to the visual and
hands-on assessments.

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENTS
When assessing the neck and head, it is important
to get a clear view of these structures. Ask clients
to remove hats and to tie their hair away from their
necks if necessary. Remember to ask permission
to touch a client before performing any hands-on
assessments.

EVALUATE THE POSITION OF THE
HEAD
To evaluate whether a client’s head is forward of its
optimal position in relation to the rest of the body,
ask the person to sit on a gym ball or on the edge
of a chair with the feet and head facing forward,
then look at him from the side. From this position,
locate the part of his cheekbone that protrudes
outward the most, just below the eye. Place one of
your index fingers on this part of the client’s cheekbone and your other index finger directly below it
on the client’s collarbone. With your index fingers
positioned in this way, stand directly over your
fingers and look down to assess the position of your
index fingers in relation to each other (see figure
6.2). Ideally, they should be vertically aligned, that
is, with one directly below the other (Chek 2001;
Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998; Price and Bratcher
2010). If the index finger on the client’s cheekbone
is ahead of the one on his collarbone, the head is

Example of forward head posi-

tion.

too far forward for optimal alignment (Chek 2001;
Price and Bratcher 2010).

EVALUATE FOR EXCESSIVE
CERVICAL LORDOSIS
To evaluate whether the curve in a client’s neck is
excessive, ask the client to stand with his back to a
wall with his heels, buttocks, and shoulders touching the wall. Have him straighten his legs and tilt
his pelvis posteriorly to decrease the arch in his
lower back to find a neutral position (see the section
Hands-On Assessment for the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip
Girdle in chapter 4 for more information on how to
coach a client into this position).
While he is holding this position, ask him to touch
the wall softly with the back of his head. (While the
back of the head will be in contact with the wall, it is
not necessary to have the head pulled back firmly.)
Make sure he does not arch his lower back as he
pulls his head back; this is a common movement
compensation.
Next, with the back of the client’s head gently
touching the wall, assess his line of sight by drawing
an imaginary line from the corner of his eye through
the center of his eyeball and out into the room. If the
neck is arched backward and the eye socket is tilted
upward, this imaginary line will not be parallel to
the floor and indicates that the client has excessive
cervical lordosis (see figure 6.3) (Johnson 2016;
Price and Bratcher 2010).

TEACHING CLIENTS
NEUTRAL POSITION OF
THE NECK AND HEAD

HOW THE HEAD AND NECK
RELATE TO THE REST OF
THE BODY

As with every other structure in the body, there is
a neutral position that is optimal for the neck and
head. The ability to achieve and maintain neutral
positions is the key to helping eliminate pain and
dysfunction (Griffin 2015). When we teach clients to
attain a neutral neck and head position, it is important to ensure that they do not cheat in positioning
other areas of the body to achieve the desired neck
and head posture.
Instruct the client to stand with her heels, buttocks, back, and shoulders against a flat wall. Next,
have her tilt her pelvis (without bending her knees)
so that only two of your knuckles will fit between her
lower back and the wall (see the section Hands-On
Assessment for the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle in chapter 4). Then ask her to pull her head and shoulders
back to the wall without arching her lower back or
neck. The head and neck are in neutral positions when
the back of the head is gently touching the wall, the
shoulders are aligned under the tragus of the ear, and
there is only a two-knuckle space between the client’s
lower back and the wall (see figure 6.4) (Kendall,
McCreary, and Provance 2005; Price and Bratcher
2010). For an example of optimal alignment of the
entire body in a standing position, see figure 6.5.

When the head moves forward from its optimal position, the thoracic spine and shoulders round forward
to accommodate this shift and the resulting effective
increase in the weight of the head. As this happens,
the neck typically arches backward excessively to
keep the eyes level and in line with the horizon
(Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998). This forward shift in
the thoracic spine, shoulders, and head subsequently
causes compensatory shifts in the pelvis and lower
back. Specifically, the lower back arches excessively
in an attempt to keep the body upright and balanced,
and the pelvis rotates anteriorly (Kendall, McCreary,
and Provance 2005). This shift in the pelvis and
lower back causes the hip socket to move backward
and the legs and hips to internally rotate, resulting
in further compensations all the way down to the
feet as the knees move toward the midline and the
feet and ankles overpronate (see figure 6.6) (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

Assessment Checklist
Before you complete your assessment of
the neck and head, you must answer the
following questions:
❏ Do you know what type of pain the client
is experiencing and how it aﬀects the
function of her upper back, shoulders,
neck, and head?
❏ Does the client have arthritis or any
diagnosed conditions that might aﬀect
the success of her program?
❏ Does the client have any past injuries or
surgeries that might aﬀect the function
of her neck and head?
❏ What makes the client’s neck and head
feel better or worse?
❏ Does the client’s neck and head pain
limit her function in any way?

❏ Does the client’s neck and head pain
aﬀect her sleep?
❏ Are other parts of the client’s body
aﬀected when her neck and head are
painful?
❏ Does the client have a forward head?
❏ Does the client have excessive cervical
lordosis?
❏ Does the client know how to achieve a
neutral position for the neck and head?
❏ Do you know how the neck and head
relate to the rest of the body, and can
you explain it to the client?
Make all your notations for this part of
the assessment on the Client Assessment
Diagram (see figure 6.7 for an example).

CONCLUDING
THE STRUCTURAL
ASSESSMENT PROCESS
By conducting the various verbal, visual, and
hands-on assessments for each part of the body and
recording your results, you are now armed with a
complete Client Assessment Diagram that details

all of a client’s musculoskeletal imbalances and
related issues. This document will serve as a vital
reference tool for helping you identify what soft
tissue structures have been affected by particular
musculoskeletal imbalances, the subject of part II
of this text. It will also help guide your exercise
selections and recommendations as you design and
implement corrective exercise programs, the subject
of parts III through V.

Review of Key Points
Optimal alignment and function of the neck and head are essential to the correct functioning
of the entire body. If the neck or head is out of alignment, the whole musculoskeletal system
must compensate (along with the brain and sensory mechanisms, such as the eyes and ears)
so that the body can remain balanced and upright.
■■The two most common deviations of the neck and head are

1. a forward position of the head, and
2. excessive cervical lordosis.
■■The cervical spine naturally contains a slight lordotic curve. However, when the head is

forward of its optimal position, the neck typically arches backward excessively to help
bring the eyes level and in line with the horizon.
■■An excessive lordotic curvature of the cervical spine may compress discs or nerves in

the neck, which can lead to pain in the arms, torso, shoulders, neck, and head.
■■It is important to determine the types and intensity of physical activity that a client

typically engages in so that you can understand how much stress he places on his neck.
This information, in addition to identifying which activities cause or alleviate pain, can
help you determine which soft tissue structures may be adversely affected and need
addressing in a corrective exercise program.


Assessing the Neck and Head

■

Pain in the jaw, especially at or near the temporomandibular joint, may occur as a result
of improper alignment of the head and neck. People with a forward head position often
feel pain or hear popping or grinding when they open or close their mouths.

■

Head and neck position affects the alignment of the body all the way down to the toes,
and vice versa.

■

Record any pertinent information on the Client Assessment Diagram.

Self-Check
Now that you know how to achieve a neutral position for all the areas of your body when
standing, try them all together to see if you can achieve a neutral standing position from
your feet to your head.
Make notes in the image that follows to help you better understand where your own
structural deviations exist. For example, if you feel the muscles in your feet working very
hard to maintain a neutral foot position, this may be a clue that you overpronate and that the
muscles of your feet are deconditioned. Alternatively, when you pull your shoulders back to
the wall to try to achieve a neutral thoracic spine and shoulder girdle position, you may feel
your lower back arch excessively. This may indicate that the muscles of your thoracic spine
and shoulders are weak, and you have to compensate by overusing your lower back to cheat
your shoulders back to the wall.
This self-check will help you identify areas of your body that need corrective exercise
attention. It will also help you understand what clients might be feeling as they try these
movements during their sessions with you.

Part II
Understanding Muscles
and Movement
In part II, you will learn how to use the results of
your assessment findings to gain insight into which
muscles (and other soft tissues) are contributing to
or are affected by the structural imbalances you have
identified. An in-depth understanding of functional
anatomy is critical to your success because it helps
you to focus on the specific soft tissue problems that
underlie most musculoskeletal imbalances.
Part II will introduce you to more than 100
muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Information is
presented on muscle locations, origins and insertion
points, movement actions, and how all these elements are interconnected through fascial networks.
You will also learn how dysfunction, weakness,
or restrictions in these structures can contribute
to the common musculoskeletal imbalances you
learned about in part I. You will also learn how
muscles perform in relation to gravity and ground
reaction forces. This will help you to understand
how the body moves in real-life settings so that you
can design effective corrective exercise programs
that not only alleviate pain, but also help clients
to get back to enjoying those physical activities
they love.
Learning the technical and anatomical details
about major muscles and how they work can be

overwhelming. However, the following chapters
will guide you through this process using easyto-understand language, imagery, and real-life
examples. Major muscles of the body are grouped by
area of the body, such as the feet and ankles, lumbopelvic hip area, or the upper back and shoulder
region. Each muscle is illustrated, with its origin and
insertion points described, and its primary actions
are described both from a traditional anatomy
standpoint (i.e., when it contracts) and a functional
standpoint (i.e., when it lengthens under tension).
Explanations of the movements that each muscle
helps the body perform, and examples of how that
muscle works during activities such as walking, running, and squatting, are also provided. Lastly, each
muscle description contains helpful tips to enhance
your comprehension and to improve your ability to
work with clients.
It is important to remember that part II does not
discuss all the muscles in the human body, and the
information should not be seen as a substitute for
medical advice. These chapters are intended simply
to give you an overview of the location and function
of many important muscles involved in the most
common musculoskeletal imbalances and their effect
on movement.
