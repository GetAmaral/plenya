## Chapter 10: Functional Anatomy of the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

CHAPTER 10
Functional Anatomy of the
Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle
The lumbo-pelvic hip girdle is composed of the
lumbar spine, pelvis, and hips. The robust bones,
strong ligaments, and large muscles of this area provide support and balance for the entire body. They
also supply mobility to both generate and transfer
forces from the lower kinetic chain to the upper
kinetic chain and vice versa during all dynamic
weight-bearing activities (Gamble 2013).

BONES AND JOINTS
The lumbo-pelvic hip girdle includes the bones of the
pelvis (ilium, ischium, and pubis), the lumbar segment of the spine, and the sacrum and coccyx (figure
10.1). It also has two very important articulations
where the bones of the spine, leg, and pelvis come
together: the sacroiliac joint and the acetabulum.
The sacroiliac joint is where the sacrum meets the
back of the pelvis (ilium). The acetabulum is a cupshaped depression in the pelvis formed where the
ischium, ilium, and pubis meet that accommodates
the end of the femur to create the hip socket. Many
ligaments help hold the bones of the pelvis, spine,
and femur in place to enable the myriad of movements possible in the lumbo-pelvic hip region (Clark
and Lucett 2011).

stand how they assist with and influence movement.
They are supported by the muscles of the torso and
legs, and therefore can be negatively affected by
musculoskeletal imbalances in these areas.

THORACOLUMBAR FASCIA
The thoracolumbar fascia, also sometimes called the
lumbodorsal fascia, is a collection of three layers of
fascia that help tie down, connect to, and bind with
many of the ligaments and big, strong muscles of the
lower back, pelvis, and rib cage (figure 10.2). This
system of fascia helps provide extra stability and
creates localized tension around the pelvis and lower
back by pulling tight when muscles of the lumbo-

pelvic hip girdle lengthen and contract. Although
the thoracolumbar fascia provides sturdiness and
support, it is also flexible and thus permits the many
movements that are required of the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle (Middleditch and Oliver 2005).
To appreciate how the thoracolumbar fascia
provides extra stability to this region, imagine the
difference between pumping air into a balloon and
pumping air into a soccer ball. As air is pumped into
the balloon, it expands and does not provide much
resistance against the air going in. On the other
hand, the leather casing of a soccer ball provides
much more resistance and creates more tension on
the outside of the ball as it inflates. This is similar
to how the dense connective tissue of the thoracolumbar fascia works. As muscles of the lumbo-pelvic
hip girdle contract, the membrane surrounding
them, the thoracolumbar fascia, becomes taut like
the outer membrane of the soccer ball. This adds
stability to the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
The attachments of the thoracolumbar fascia to
muscles and structures across the lower back also
contribute to its stabilizing features when these
muscles or structures move (Middleditch and Oliver
2005). For example, the thoracolumbar fascia has
attachments to the back of the pelvis. Therefore,
when the back of the pelvis is engaged in movement
(e.g., during a posterior pelvic tilt), it pulls on the
thoracolumbar fascia, and tension is created across
and throughout the tissue, helping stabilize the area.

There are many ligaments in the lumbo-pelvic hip
area that help provide stability and help transfer
forces through the joints of the hips, pelvis, and
spine (figure 10.3) (Muscolino 2011). These ligaments not only provide local stability to the lumbopelvic hip region, but because they share connective tissue with many large muscles, they also help
transfer tension across some of the most important
joints in the body, such as the sacroiliac joint. For
example, the sacrotuberous ligament spans from the
base of the spine (the sacrum) across to the ischial
tuberosity of the pelvis (see figure 10.4). In most
people this ligament is a direct continuation of the
tendon of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle).
Consequently, it links the lower body directly
to the spine by way of the hamstrings, since the
hamstrings originate on the ischial tuberosity and
run down the back of the leg, attaching just below
the knee (Gray 1995). When the hamstring group
lengthens under tension, it not only slows the hips
as they flex, but it also provides stability and support to the sacroiliac joint and spine by way of the
sacrotuberous ligament (Myers 2008).

MUSCLES
Many muscles originate in the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle. This chapter examines those muscles that
originate from the pelvis and spine (Gray 1995).
They include the following:
■■Gluteus minimus
■■Gluteus medius
■■Tensor fasciae latae (TFL)
■■Spinalis
■■Longissimus
■■Iliocostalis
■■Quadratus lumborum
■■Rectus abdominis
■■Internal obliques
■■External obliques
■■Psoas major
■■Iliacus

Note: While the gluteus maximus muscle originates
from the lumbo-pelvic hip region and affects the
function of this area, it also has great influence on
movements of the leg and knee. The gluteus maximus muscle is described in detail in chapter 9.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Gluteus Minimus (Abductor Group)
Muscle specifics: A deep abductor muscle that originates on the side of the pelvis on the outside of the
ilium, fans down across the side of the pelvis, and
inserts on the top of the outside of the femur (Gray
1995).
Muscle action(s): Moves the hip and leg away from
the midline (i.e., abducts the hip and leg). The fibers
toward the front of the muscle also help to internally
rotate the hip and leg (Muscolino 2011).

Gluteus
minimus

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of
the gluteus minimus helps to decelerate the pelvis as
it shifts over and outside the leg when the foot is in
contact with the ground (i.e., when the leg adducts and
externally rotates).
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee
cord to help slow the side-to-side movements of the hip and the external rotation of the leg
E6993/Price/TF10.01/584324/mh-R1
when the foot first strikes the ground during activities like walking
and running. Tension
created in this muscle during these side-to-side movements is then used to help pull the hip
back toward the midline of the body and to internally rotate the leg to help transfer weight
to the other side.
Helpful tips: The gluteus minimus and gluteus medius work together to help decelerate the
hip as it moves toward the outside of the body during all weight-bearing activities.

Gluteus Medius (Abductor Group)
Muscle specifics: A fan-shaped muscle of the buttocks
that originates on the side and back of the pelvis just
below the iliac crest, runs down the side of the pelvis,
and inserts at the top of the femur on the outside surface (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Moves the hip and leg away from the
midline (i.e., abducts the hip and leg). The fibers toward
the back of the muscle help to rotate the leg outward,
while the fibers toward the front of the muscle help to
rotate the leg inward (Muscolino 2011).

Gluteus
medius

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
gluteus medius helps to decelerate the pelvis as it shifts
over and outside the leg when the foot is in contact
with the ground (i.e., adducts the hip and leg). The
fibers toward the front of this muscle also help slow
down outward rotation when lengthened, while the
fibers toward the back help slow down inward rotation of the hip and leg when lengthened.
E6993/Price/TF10.02/584325/mh-R1
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to help slow
down hip and leg adduction during activities such as walking, running, side-shuffling, and salsa dancing, where the
knee moves toward the midline and the hip moves toward the outside. The gluteus medius
also helps to slow down the leg as it moves into internal and external rotation (depending on
the parts of the muscle that are lengthening) during all dynamic weight-bearing activities.

Helpful tips: The gluteus medius is one of the best lateral stabilizing muscles of the hip
and leg complex.


Functional Anatomy of the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

Tensor Fasciae Latae (Abductor Group)
Muscle specifics: An abductor muscle that originates on the
side of the pelvis on the iliac crest, runs down the side of the
pelvis, and merges with the iliotibial band, which continues all
the way down the side of the thigh and inserts on the outside
of the tibia (Gray 1995).

Tensor fascia
latae

Muscle action(s): Moves the hip and leg away from the midline (i.e., abducts the hip and leg). The fibers toward the back
of the muscle help with hip extension and outward rotation
of the leg. The fibers toward the front of the muscle help with
hip flexion and inward rotation of the leg (Muscolino 2011).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the tensor
fasciae latae helps decelerate the hip and leg as they move
toward the midline (i.e., as they adduct). The front portion of
the muscle helps slow down outward rotation and extension of
the hip and leg when lengthened. The back portion of the muscle
helps slow down inward rotation and flexion of the hip and leg.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
help slow down hip and leg adduction during activities such
as walking, running, or hula dancing, where the knee moves
toward the midline and the hip moves toward the outside. The
tensor fasciae latae also helps to slow down flexion and extension of the hips during activities like jumping over hurdles,
and it controls internal and external leg movements during
weight-bearing activities.
Helpful tips: Tensor fasciae latae tightness or dysfunction can cause pain in the lower back,
E6993/Price/TF10.03/584326/mh-R1
in the side of the hips, and in the side of the knee.

Spinalis (Erector Spinae Group)
Muscle specifics: An erector spinae muscle that is divided
into three parts. The bottom part originates from the top portion of the lumbar spine and the bottom of the thoracic spine,
runs up along the thoracic spine, and inserts on the spinous
processes near the top of the thoracic spine. The two upper
segments run from the top of the thoracic spine to the top of
the neck and from the bottom of the cervical spine to the top
of the neck (Gray 1995).

Spinalis

Muscle action(s): Arches the spine and head backward (i.e.,
extends them) and bends the spine and head to the side when
the fibers on only one side of the spine contract (Cramer and
Darby 2014).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the spinalis
helps decelerate the spine and head as they bend forward (i.e.,
into flexion) and to the side (when the fibers on only one side
of the spine elongate).
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord in
conjunction with the other erector spinae muscles to help slow
down the spine as it bends forward and from side to side, like
when leaning over the counter to wash dishes or cook.
Helpful tips: The spinalis muscle is the erector muscle that lies closest to the spine.

Longissimus (Erector Spinae Group)
Muscle specifics: An erector spinae muscle that is
divided into three parts. The lumbar and thoracic segment
originates from the thoracolumbar fascia and transverse
processes of the lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae and
inserts farther up on the transverse processes of all the
thoracic vertebrae. The neck and head segments originate
on the upper thoracic vertebrae, travel up the spine, and
insert at the neck and head (Gray 1995).

Longissimus

Muscle action(s): Arches the spine and head backward
(i.e., into extension) and bends the spine and head to the
side. The upper portion also helps rotate the head when
only one side of the muscle contracts (Cramer and Darby
2014).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
longissimus helps decelerate forward bending (flexion)
of the spine and head and side bending (side flexion) of
the neck and head when the fibers on just one side of the
spine elongate.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord in conjunctionE6993/Price/TF.10.05/584328/R3JB
with the other erector
spinae muscles to help slow down the spine as it bends forward and from side to side, like
when bending over to pick up scattered objects.
Helpful tips: The longissimus muscle blends with the thoracolumbar fascia of the lower back.
This results in a strong origin point that provides great support to the pelvis and lumbar spine.

Iliocostalis (Erector Spinae Group)
Muscle specifics: An erector spinae muscle that is divided
into three parts. The lumbar segment originates on the back
of the pelvis and lumbar spine, travels up the spine, and
inserts on the lower six ribs; the thoracic segment originates
and inserts on the rib cage; the cervical section originates
on the upper ribs and inserts at the neck (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Arches the spine backward (i.e.,
extends the spine) and bends the spine from side to side
(i.e., side flexes the spine) when the fibers on just one side
of the spine are contracted (Cramer and Darby 2014).

Iliocostalis

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
iliocostalis helps to decelerate forward bending (flexion)
of the spine and side bending of the spine when the fibers
on just one side of the spine elongate.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord
in conjunction with the other erector spinae muscles to
help slow down the spine as it bends forward and from side
to side during activities like walking or running or when
bending forward to remove clothes from a dryer.
Helpful tips: The iliocostalis is the erector spinae muscle
that lies furthest away from the spine. Like the longissimus,
it blends into the thoracolumbar fascia at the bottom of
the lower back.

Functional Anatomy of the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

Quadratus Lumborum
Muscle specifics: A flat muscle that originates on the
back of the pelvis, travels upward and across the lower
back and inserts on the sides of the first four lumbar
vertebrae and the last rib (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Bends the spine to the side (i.e.,
side flexes the spine), arches it backward (extends) and
assists with breathing. It also helps lift the pelvis toward
the rib cage when only one side contracts (Clippinger
2007).

Quadratus
lumborum

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
quadratus lumborum helps decelerate the spine as it
bends sideways (i.e., lateral flexion) and the spine as
it bends forward (i.e., flexes) and helps to stabilize and
lower one side of the pelvis (when the fibers on just that
side lengthen).

E6993/Price/TF10.06a/591191/mh-R1

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to slow down the spine as it bends
sideways during activities like reaching to pick up something you have dropped beside your
chair, or slows down the lumbar spine as it bends forward, like when you bend down to pick
up a ball.
Helpful tips: To feel the quadratus lumborum working, stand sideways on a flight of stairs
with one foot on a stair and the other leg hanging over the stair below. Place your hand on
either side of your lower back, and alternately lift and lower your hanging leg to feel this
muscle shorten and lengthen.

Rectus Abdominis (Abdominal Group)
Muscle specifics: A long, flat abdominal muscle that
originates from the bottom of the pelvis on the pubic
bone, travels up the front of the torso, and inserts at
the bottom of the sternum and at the cartilage of ribs 5
through 7 (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Bends (flexes) the spine forward and
compresses the abdomen (Clippinger 2007).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
rectus abdominis helps decelerate the spine as it arches
backward (i.e., extends).
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional
sense to help with activities that require spine flexion,
like sitting up in bed. Acts like a bungee cord to slow
down spine extension (and to store potential energy for
spine flexion) during activities like reaching up and back
when serving a ball in tennis or performing a throw-in
during a soccer game.
Helpful tips: Performing traditional crunches where
the spine just flexes can chronically shorten the rectus
abdominis. However, exercises that require the abdominals to slow down spinal extension (see Extension
Crunch in chapter 21) will help strengthen this muscle
eccentrically to enable it to effectively slow down the
spine when it must arch backward.

Internal Obliques (Abdominal Group)
Muscle specifics: Abdominal muscles that originate at the
back of the torso from the sides of the thoracolumbar fascia and
ilium of the pelvis, wrap up and around to the front and side of
the torso, and insert in the connective tissue on the midline of
the abdominals and the bottom three ribs (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Help bend the spine forward (i.e., flex the
spine) and rotate the torso. They also assist in abdomen compression and in side bending of the spine when the fibers on
only one side contract (Clippinger 2007).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the internal
obliques helps decelerate the spine as it arches backward (i.e.,
extends), rotates, and side bends. During these movements, the
muscle also stores potential energy to assist with spine flexion
and rotation in the opposite direction.

Internal
obliques

Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense
to help flex, rotate, and side-bend the spine (e.g., to produce
power to chop wood). Acts like a bungee cord to slow down
extension, rotation, and side bending of the spine in activities
like golf, tennis, and turning around in the car to get something
from the back seat.
Helpful tips: The abdominal muscles all work together to help
slow down extension, rotation, and side bending of the spine.
They are multifunctional muscles and should be exercised in
a multifunctional manner.

E6993/Price/TF10.08/584331/mh-R1

External Obliques (Abdominal Group)
Muscle specifics: Abdominal muscles that originate from the
sides of the lower eight ribs, travel down and slightly across the
front of the torso, and insert at the middle of the abdomen on
the linea alba and the sides and front of the pelvis (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Help bend the spine forward (i.e., flex the
spine) and rotate the torso. They also assist with side bending
of the spine (when the fibers on only one side are contracted)
and abdominal compression (Clippinger 2007).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the external obliques helps decelerate the spine as it arches backward
(extends), rotates, and side bends.

External
obliques

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord in
conjunction with the internal obliques to slow down extension,
side bending, and rotation of the torso in movements such
as swinging the arms and rotating the torso when walking,
running, and taking a backswing in golf. Furthermore, these
muscles store potential energy during these movements to
produce powerful movements in the opposite direction (e.g., a
follow-through in a golf swing).
Helpful tips: The movement produced in the torso by the
rotary action of the obliques helps increase blood supply to
the abdominal fascia, helping to keep it healthy, flexible, and
functional.

Functional Anatomy of the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

Psoas Major (Hip Flexor Group)
Muscle specifics: A hip flexor muscle that originates on
the sides of all the lumbar vertebrae and last thoracic vertebrae, travels across the pelvis, and inserts on the inside
of the top of the femur toward the back (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Flexes the hip and leg and outwardly
rotates the hip and leg. It also helps stabilize the lumbopelvic hip girdle when a person is standing (Gray 1995).

Psoas
major

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
psoas major helps decelerate extension and internal rotation of the hip and leg. This action enables the muscle to
store potential energy, which is then used to help the leg
externally rotate as the hip flexes.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord
to slow down the leg as it moves behind the pelvis during
activities like walking and running. The lengthening of this
muscle creates potential energy that is used to help swing
the leg forward and bend the hip during these activities.
Helpful tips: Tight hip flexors can pull the lumbar spine
forward, causing (and exacerbating) excessive lumbar
lordosis and an anterior pelvic tilt.

E6993/Price/TF10.10/584333/mh-R3

Go to the online video to watch video 10.1, where Justin talks about how the psoas
major muscle works in real-life.

Iliacus (Hip Flexor Group)
Muscle specifics: A hip flexor muscle that originates
on the inside of the front of the pelvis near the top and
travels down the pelvis and across the hip socket before
inserting on the inside of the top of the femur toward the
back (Gray 1995).

Iliacus

Muscle action(s): Flexes and outwardly rotates the hip
and leg (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the iliacus helps decelerate the extension and internal rotation
of the hip and leg.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord
to help slow down the hip and leg as the leg travels behind
the body (i.e., into extension); it also slows the internal
rotation of the leg during activities like walking, running,
and climbing stairs. The lengthening of this muscle also
creates potential energy to subsequently help lift the leg
forward and rotate it outward (i.e., flex the hip).
Helpful tips: The iliacus connects with the muscle fibers
of the psoas major as it crosses the hip socket, ensuring
that the leg and pelvis work together as the hip and leg
flex, extend, and rotate.

EFFECT OF LUMBO-PELVIC
HIP GIRDLE MUSCLES
ON THE MOST COMMON
MUSCULOSKELETAL
DEVIATIONS
The muscles discussed in this section all play a role
in helping control movement of the legs, hips, pelvis,
and lumbar spine. They provide structure and support and form a vital link between the upper and
lower body, allowing the legs to move freely below
and the torso, arms, neck, and head to remain balanced and mobile above. Any muscle imbalance in
the lumbo-pelvic hip region can disrupt movement
and function anywhere in the kinetic chain (Price
and Bratcher 2010).
Here are four examples of how the bungee cord
features of the muscle groups covered in this chapter
factor into the two most common deviations of the
lumbo-pelvic hip girdle.

EXAMPLE ONE: THE
ABDUCTORS
Traditional anatomy tells us that when the abductor muscles of the hip contract, they move the leg
away from the midline of the body (DeLisa, Gans,
and Walsh 2005). An example of how the abductors
work in this way would be if you were to push a
door open with the outside of your leg because your
hands were full with groceries. However, when these
muscles lengthen, such as when force is transferred
onto the weight-bearing leg during gait, they function in a different way. In this case, the abductors
lengthen under tension to slow down the movement
of the hip and the top of the leg toward the outside of
the body (see figure 10.5). This also slows down the
knee as it moves toward the midline of the body into
a valgus position (DeLisa, Gans, and Walsh 2005).
The tension created in these muscles during these
movements also helps to stabilize the hip socket to
ensure correct function of the entire lumbo-pelvic
hip girdle. If this muscle group is not functioning
correctly, the leg, knee, hip, and pelvis become destabilized. This can result in excessive rotation of the
hip and leg and shifting of the pelvis into excessive
anterior rotation (Price and Bratcher 2010).
You can experience the real-life function of the
abductor muscles by standing in a split stance with
your right leg forward, as though you were going to

Figure 10.5 Example of the bungee cord
action of the abductors.
E6993/Price/F10.05/584335/mh-R1

perform a lunge. Place your right hand on the side
of your right hip as you reach your left hand out
directly toward your left side. Perform a gentle lunge
as you shift your right hip to the right. The further
you push your right hip to the right, the more you
will feel the abductor muscles on the sides of your
hips working. Since your right hip has moved outside and away from your right knee into hip and leg
adduction, the gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus,
gluteus medius, and TFL have all lengthened like
bungee cords to stop your hip from moving too far
to the right (and to prevent you from falling over).

EXAMPLE TWO: THE
ERECTOR SPINAE
As the name implies, the erector spinae group of
muscles helps keep the spine erect over the pelvis.
When the spine must bend forward, this group of
muscles lengthens under tension like bungee cords
to help decelerate the forward motion. This lengthening of the muscles also helps generate tension that


Functional Anatomy of the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

can be used to pull the spine upright. However, if
these muscles are not working correctly, they cannot
prevent the torso from falling forward during activities such as standing, walking, or running, nor can
they help return the torso to an upright position
when needed. Consequently, the body’s center of
gravity shifts forward, and the rest of the body must
compensate to remain balanced. This can disrupt
the position of the bones of the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle since the pelvis, which is naturally already
tilted forward, rotates further, resulting in an anterior pelvic tilt (see figure 10.6) and the lower back
arching excessively in an attempt to help keep the
torso erect (Price and Bratcher 2010).

EXAMPLE THREE: THE
ABDOMINALS
The traditional anatomical function of the abdominal
group of muscles is to bend the spine forward and
sideways and to rotate it. However, the abdominal
muscles not only flex and rotate the spine, but they
also lengthen like bungee cords to slow the rate at

Figure 10.6 Example of lumbar spine and
pelvis shifting to compensate
for a forward position in one’s
center of gravity.

which the spine extends, side flexes, and rotates.
For example, when a person is walking, the rectus
abdominis lengthens under tension as impact from
the ground travels up through the lower body to
the pelvis, rib cage, and spine (see figure 10.7). In
doing so, it decelerates forces on the lumbar spine as
it arches backward, helping to reduce the negative
effects of excessive lumbar lordosis. Furthermore,
the obliques lengthen under tension like bungee
cords as the torso moves from side to side and
rotates, which also reduces forces on the lumbar
spine (see figure 10.8) (Price and Bratcher 2010).

EXAMPLE FOUR: THE HIP
FLEXORS
Traditional descriptions of the hip flexors state
that this group of muscles flexes and outwardly
rotates the hip and leg in order to lift and swing
the leg forward. While this is accurate, they also
serve another purpose by lengthening under tension to slow down extension and internal rotation
of the hip and leg as they travel behind the body

when the foot is on the ground. However, if the
hip flexors cannot lengthen effectively, it causes
the lower back to overarch as the leg extends (see
figure 10.9). Since the hip flexors originate from
the lumbar spine and pelvis and attach to the top
of the femur, chronic shortening (or dysfunction)
of these muscles results in the lumbar spine being
pulled forward toward the leg, exacerbating the
common imbalance of excessive lumbar lordosis
(and accompanying anterior pelvic tilt).
The inability of the hip flexors to lengthen
effectively causes problems during all weightbearing activities, but especially those that
require the hip and leg to go into extension
because more flexibility is required of the hip
flexors to help regulate extension movements

Functional Anatomy of the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

Review of Key Points
The muscles and other soft tissues of the lumbo-pelvic hip region provide wonderful stability
to the hips, pelvis, and lumbar spine. They also play a key role in helping with locomotion by
facilitating great degrees of movement in the legs and torso.
■■The thoracolumbar fascia is a broad, dense, and multilayered fascial system that covers

the bones, muscles, and soft tissues of the lower back, pelvis, and spine. It provides
incredible support and stability for the lumbo-pelvic hip area.
■■Many important ligaments help tie the lumbo-pelvic hip region together. The sacrotuber-

ous ligament, for example, binds the sacrum to the pelvis, but it also connects the legs
(via the hamstrings’ origin point) to the base of the spine. This cooperation between the
hamstrings and the spine that results from this ligament (and others) enables the hips,
legs, and spine to work together to control flexion and extension.
■■The abductors lengthen to slow down hip and leg adduction when force is being trans-

ferred to the weight-bearing leg during gait.
■■The erector spinae muscles help lift the spine upright, but they also work in a lengthen-

ing fashion to slow the spine down as it bends forward and from side to side.
■■The abdominal muscles help flex, side bend, and rotate the spine. They are commonly

conditioned to perform these movements using concentric exercises such as sit-ups or
crunches. However, since their function is also to help slow down spine rotation, side
flexion, and extension as they lengthen, they should also be strengthened with exercises
that require eccentric movements.
■■The hip flexor muscles contract to swing the leg forward when walking, but they also

work in a lengthening fashion to slow down hip and leg extension. Musculoskeletal deviations such as overpronation, a valgus knee, or an anterior pelvic tilt affect the alignment
of the leg in the hip socket, thereby affecting the ability of the hip flexors to lengthen
and load correctly.

Self-Check
Your understanding of the bungee cord concept of how muscles lengthen to slow movement
(and subsequently store potential energy to produce movement) should be improving. The
loading and unloading of muscles in this way ensures that joints experience less stress from
the forces of nature and that movement is more effective and efficient.
Try to think of a movement for each of the following muscles where the muscle works to
help slow down gravity, rotary forces, or both. For example, if someone were to bend over
and pick up a coin, the spinalis muscle would help slow down the spine as it rounds forward
against the force of gravity.
