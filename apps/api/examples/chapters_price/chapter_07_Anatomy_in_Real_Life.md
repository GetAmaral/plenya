## Chapter 7: Anatomy in Real Life

CHAPTER 7
Anatomy in Real Life
Anatomy instruction has long been a standard part
of the education of health and fitness professionals. Until recently, however, most of what has been
taught has come from a traditional anatomy perspective—that is, muscle A goes from bone 1 to bone 2,
and when it contracts it pulls these bones together.
For example, traditional anatomy texts explain
that the quadriceps muscles of the leg extend or
straighten the knee (Gray 1995; Golding and Golding
2003; Draves 1986).
Traditional anatomy instruction has its place, but
most of that information has come from studying
cadavers to find where specific muscles attach. This
has resulted in an incomplete concept of muscle
function that only reflects what happens when an
isolated muscle group, such as the quadriceps, is
manually contracted in a non-weight-bearing situation. In real-life settings, however, fitness clients
are not lying motionless on an examination table.
They are upright, moving in all directions and
constantly dealing with different environmental
stressors, including gravity and ground reaction
forces. Therefore, fitness professionals must also
understand how muscles function during these
activities. Unfortunately, real-life functional
anatomy information is almost entirely absent from
traditional anatomy instruction. Understanding the
real-life actions of muscles is essential to a complete
understanding of how movement dysfunction and
musculoskeletal imbalances are caused, and thus
it is central to the design of effective corrective
exercise programs.
In this chapter, you will learn about the components of the musculoskeletal system, which include
bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. You

will also learn how gravity and ground reaction
forces influence muscles and the effect this has
on their ability to both contribute to and prevent
common musculoskeletal deviations.

where Justin talks about the difference
between traditional and functional anatomy.

HOW GRAVITY AFFECTS
MOVEMENT
Gravity is a force of attraction put out by the earth
that pulls everything on its surface toward the core
of the planet. To help you understand how gravity
affects human movement, imagine the center of
the earth as a giant magnet and imagine that your
entire body is covered by a thin metallic coating.
Naturally, the magnet would attract the metallic
coating to itself, thereby preventing your body from
being dragged into deep, dark space. However, since
the magnetic core of the earth is very far away from
the surface upon which you live, you can temporarily break contact with the magnetic force and move
around. Nevertheless, the magnetic pull on your
body is constant and always more powerful than
your attempts to defeat it. When you lift your foot
to walk, jump to catch a ball, or climb into bed, you
can momentarily break free from the ground, but
you are almost instantly pulled back to earth again
by gravity.
The force of gravity is intense, and it acts on the
body at all times. This means that while gravity helps

keep people grounded, the structures of the body
must also work hard against this downward pull to
remain upright. If we could not do this, we would
be crushed like aluminum cans against the ground.
One of the most important parts of the human body
is the skeletal system, which provides a strong,
unyielding frame to support the body’s resistance
to the pull of gravity.
The human body is also equipped with soft tissue
systems (muscles, ligaments, tendons, and fascia)
whose role is to help the skeleton move. As you know
from traditional anatomy, when muscles contract,
they bring bones together. As we will discuss in
later chapters, muscles also lengthen to slow bones
and joints as they move apart. Soft tissue structures
also help minimize stress on the skeletal system
from gravity (Siegfried 2016). If you were standing
upright and were in perfect structural alignment, for
example, your skeletal system, along with the ligaments, would keep you erect; your center of gravity
would be balanced over a solid foundation, and your
muscles would not need to work much against the
force of gravity. However, if you were to lean forward
as if to pick up a pencil on the floor, your center of
gravity would shift forward, and the muscles on the
back of your torso would lengthen (with tension in
them) to help slow down the movement of your skeleton as you reach toward the ground (Price 2014).

HOW GROUND REACTION
FORCES AFFECT
MOVEMENT
Ground reaction forces are explained by Newton’s
third law of motion, which states that for every action
there is an equal but opposite reaction. Simply put,
when force is applied by one object to another object
(for example, by your body coming into contact with
the ground through your foot when you walk), the
ground returns the same amount of force through
the foot to the body in the opposite direction (Ayyappa 1997).
What this means for our musculoskeletal system
is that in addition to dealing with the constant pull
of gravity, the body must also contend with the
resulting shock that is created and transferred back
into the system every time any part of you comes
in contact with another object or surface. Muscles,
tendons, ligaments, and fascia help regulate this
stress from ground reaction forces by lengthening
and stretching in order to slow the transmission of
energy as it travels through the body to the joints and
underlying skeletal system (Myers 2008; Price 2010).

The amount of force exerted on the bones,
joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and fascia by
gravity and ground reaction forces is remarkable.
If every component of the musculoskeletal system
is in perfect working order, the body can withstand
tremendous pressure without any negative effects.
However, if any of the elements are not functioning
at their best, then musculoskeletal imbalances that
can affect movement and performance may develop
over time. To help people to identify and overcome
musculoskeletal imbalances, a fitness professional
must understand how the body and its soft tissue
structures work both individually and together to
resist gravity and absorb ground reaction forces.
This will enable you to choose appropriate corrective
exercises to correct imbalances and retrain a client’s
musculoskeletal system to effectively deal with these
constant forces of nature (Price and Bratcher 2010).

OVERVIEW OF THE
MUSCULOSKELETAL
SYSTEM
Before we go into the functions of specific muscles
and other soft tissues in depth, an overview of all
the major structures of the musculoskeletal system
will be presented, briefly describing how they work
together to facilitate movement. Understanding the
anatomy of individual muscles, especially where they
originate and insert, will help you to link together
chains of muscles and fascia from the feet to the
head. As you begin to see the body as an integrated
chain of bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and
fascia, you will better appreciate how musculoskeletal dysfunction in one part of the body can have
its roots elsewhere. The remainder of part II will
examine the purposes of individual muscles (and
other soft tissue structures) and their role in some
of the most common musculoskeletal imbalances.

BONES
At birth, the human body contains about 300 bones
(Marshall 2010). As we grow and age, some of these
bones, such as those in the head, pelvis, and sacrum,
fuse together. As a result, an adult has approximately
206 bones. The exact number can differ from person
to person due to the fact that some people are born
with extra bones, such as ribs (Gray 1995). Bones
provide the internal framework for the body (see
figure 7.1). They also protect vital organs and nerves,
and together with muscles, ligaments, tendons, and
fascia they comprise the musculoskeletal system.

Bones are made of hard, inflexible tissue that
contains mainly calcium and collagen (Gray 1995).
There are five types of bones in the body: long,
short, flat, sesamoid, and irregular. The long bones
are so named because they are usually longer than
they are wide. They are designed to provide mobility. Examples of long bones include the femur in
the upper leg, the humerus in the upper arm, the
metatarsals in the feet, and the metacarpals in the
hands (Dimon and Day 2008). A short bone is usually
about as wide as it is long. Short bones are designed
to provide support and stability. Examples include
the tarsal bones toward the back of the foot, such
as the navicular bone and the cuneiforms (Dimon
and Day 2008). Flat bones are generally flat and help
protect the body and its vital organs. They also provide surface area for muscular attachment (Dimon
and Day 2008). Examples of flat bones include ribs,
the bones of the skull, the scapula, and the pelvis
(Price and Bratcher 2010). Sesamoid bones are usually embedded in tendons, and their function is to
protect the host tendon (Gray 1995). The patella is
an example. Irregular bones have an irregular shape

and cannot be classified as any other type of bone.
The vertebrae, the sacrum, and the mandible (jawbone) are examples of irregular bones (Gray 1995).
Bones are usually covered in smooth cartilage at
either end to help prevent the two ends from rubbing together and to protect the joint space. Since
cartilage is a firm, rubbery tissue, it also helps aid
in shock absorption; it serves this function between
the intervertebral discs of the spine (Gray 1995). The
joint spaces between bones contain synovial fluid,
a clear substance that is secreted to help lubricate
the joint and keep it mobile (Dimon and Day 2008).
Some bones have rounded edges called condyles
that protrude from the ends of the bone to enable
smooth articulation between bones, particularly at
a joint (Gray 1995).

LIGAMENTS
The word ligament comes from the Latin word
ligare, which means to “bind or tie.” Ligaments are
tough bands of connective tissue that join bones
together at a joint like the knee. Ligaments provide

65


66

stability to the body by keeping bones together and
preventing excessive movement at a joint (Dimon
and Day 2008).
The anterior cruciate ligament in the knee is a
well-known protective ligament. It binds the femur
of the upper leg to the tibia of the lower leg and
prevents too much forward motion or rotation of the
knee (Draves 1986). There are also ligaments that
support such internal organs as the liver, uterus,
bladder, and diaphragm and help keep them in place
(Gray 1995). The bones and ligaments are the main
structures that support the body when a person is
not moving. However, any time there is movement,
the muscles, tendons, and fascia also get involved
to help create, accelerate, and decelerate motion.

MUSCLES
Muscles are specialized tissues made from bundles
of cells responsible for controlling movement in
the body by either contracting (i.e., shortening) or
expanding (i.e., lengthening) (Price 2010). There are
three types of muscle tissue in the body (Martini,
Timmons, and Tallitsch 2014):
1. Smooth muscle tissue regulates unconscious
movement in the body. An example of a smooth
muscle is the digestive or intestinal tract.
2. Cardiac muscle is only found in the heart and
is not under conscious control.
3. Skeletal muscle, which is under conscious control, is so named because it usually attaches to
the bones of the skeleton.
Skeletal muscle is the most common type of
muscle in the body and is generally what people
think of when we say “muscles.” The adult human
body contains over 650 named skeletal muscles
(Gray 1995). Skeletal muscle enables us to move
about from place to place because it can produce
both gross and fine voluntary movements (Golding
and Golding 2003). Examples of skeletal muscle
include the gluteal muscles, calf muscles, and hamstrings. In later chapters you will learn about the
functions of many of the major skeletal muscles and
the effect they have on the most common musculoskeletal imbalances.

TENDONS
The word tendon comes from the Latin word tendere which means “to stretch.” Tendons are flexible,
yet tough connective tissues that attach muscle to
bone (Dimon and Day 2008). A tendon is formed as

fibers come together at the end of a muscle (similar
in nature to bunching a group of rose stems together
at the bottom). This tapering of the muscle enables
it to attach, via the tendon, to the appropriate site
on a bone (Price and Bratcher 2010). An example of
a tendon is the Achilles tendon.
Muscles can produce a lot of power, so the accompanying tendons must be rigid but also flexible
enough to ensure that the muscle does not detach
from the bone when it shortens and lengthens during
movement. When a person ruptures an Achilles
tendon, for example, this means that the tendon has
torn away from its attachment site on the back of
the calcaneus. Excessive wear and tear to a tendon
can cause it to become irritated and inflamed, a
condition called tendonitis (Kendall, McCreary, and
Provance 2005).

FASCIA
Fascia is a three-dimensional web of connective
tissue that wraps around, supports, and separates
nearly every structure in the body (Myers 2008). It
is one of the most important, but sometimes most
overlooked, elements of a healthy musculoskeletal
system. Since fascia is involved in every part of
the musculoskeletal system, any restrictions or
irritations in the fascia can affect the functioning
of structures there (i.e., the muscle it envelops and
the joint or joints that muscle acts upon) as well as
in other areas (Rolf 1989). Because it plays such a
vital role in the functioning of the musculoskeletal
system, expanded information on fascia and myofascial networks is provided in chapter 13.

HUMAN BUNGEE
CORD SYSTEM
Most anatomical texts describe the primary function
of a muscle as pulling two bones toward each other.
However, in real life muscles do not always function
this way. Muscles also work like bungee cords; tension in a muscle increases as the bones move away
from each other and the muscle fibers elongate. This
tension helps slow down forces acting on the body
while also storing potential energy for use when the
fibers contract (Price 2016). For example, if you were
to squat down, your gluteal muscles would stretch
and lengthen and would act to slow down your hips
as they bent. The stored tension in the lengthened
muscle would then be released as the muscle contracted to help straighten your hips and stand you
back upright (Price and Bratcher 2010).

To better appreciate how the muscular system
is akin to bungee cords, visualize a person who is
attached by his feet to the end of a bungee cord as
he jumps off a bridge. If the bungee cord gets the
right amount of tension on it as the person nears
the ground/water, he will be saved from crashing
into it. However, if the bungee cord does not pull
tight at the right time, the person will hit the surface with dire consequences. Muscles, tendons, and
fascia act in a similar way. Together they protect our
musculoskeletal structures (especially our joints)
from excessive stress by pulling tight at the right
moment to help slow down forces on our bodies as
we move (figure 7.2).
In addition to helping regulate stresses on the
musculoskeletal system, these soft tissue “bungee
cords” also store energy that can be used to create
strong, powerful movements when that energy is
released—that is, when the muscle fibers subsequently contract. This is akin to when the bungee
cord reaches its maximum stretch and then retracts,
pulling the person powerfully back up to where the
bungee cord is anchored.

Review of Key Points
The musculoskeletal system is comprised of an intricate arrangement of several different
types of bones and soft tissue structures that work in concert to control movement, deal
with the constant pull of gravity, and dissipate ground reaction forces.
■■Traditional anatomy texts emphasize the functions of muscles as contracting to bring

bones together. However, muscles also help regulate the transfer of energy through the
body by elongating, or working eccentrically.
■■Bones occur in five main types to provide shape, support, and protection for our bodies:

long bones, short bones, flat bones, sesamoid bones, and irregular bones.
■■Ligaments are a type of connective tissue that connects bones together and helps provide

stability and mobility for our joints.
■■There are three types of muscle in the human body: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal.
■■There are over 650 skeletal muscles in the human body. They apply force to bones to

help create and regulate movement.
■■Tendons are a type of connective tissue that binds muscle fibers together to enable indi-

vidual muscles to attach to bone. It is the attachment of muscles to bones via tendons
that enable muscles to produce movement.
■■Fascia connects everything together in the body. Since fascia is interconnected and

wrapped around every part, any restrictions or irritations in the fascia can affect the
functioning of structures both in the immediate area and in other areas of the body.
■■The human muscular system works in a fashion similar to bungee cords in that muscles

and soft tissue structures must lengthen under tension, and at the right rate, to help
slow movement and prevent injury. Muscles and soft tissue structures also use potential
energy stored in them as they lengthen under tension to produce powerful movements
when they contract.
