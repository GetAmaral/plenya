CHAPTER 22
Building Successful Client
Relationships
Designing effective corrective exercise programs
requires you to apply your technical skills. However,
an equally important aspect of program design
involves forming productive working relationships
with clients. This requires you to evaluate a client’s
motivations for seeking out your help and to adapt
your communication, teaching, and coaching strategies for each person. Understanding the needs of
clients is important to ensuring the success of your
corrective exercise programs (Price and Bratcher
2010).

UNDERSTANDING BASIC
MOTIVATIONS AND
BEHAVIOR
There are two main reasons why clients who suffer
from the effects of musculoskeletal imbalances seek
help from allied health and fitness professionals.
1. They lack the knowledge (or the time required
to gain the knowledge) they need to resolve
the problem on their own. Clients may not be
aware of what is causing their problems or what
techniques can help solve them.
2. They lack confidence in their own abilities. This
lack of confidence, which is usually linked to
their lack of knowledge, often results from a

bad experience with exercise or with another
fitness professional in the past. This fuels their
anxiety and their fear of failure about engaging
in a program of regular exercise (Caissy 1998).
These psychological factors can present a challenge for you if you do not address them properly
when building client relationships.
To develop an effective working relationship with
a client who lacks knowledge or confidence, you
must understand some basic principles about human
interaction and behavior. There are some fundamental dynamics that exist whenever a relationship is
created between two parties, particularly in those
relationships where one party is seeking help or
advice from the other. In this type of relationship,
each person assumes a role, either as the expert or as
the subordinate, based on whether one is the person
providing assistance or the person being assisted
(Bandura 1986).
This chapter will briefly address the major
components of an expert–subordinate relationship
so that you can learn to manage them to create
productive client relationships. They will also be
highlighted in later chapters to help you understand
the intricacies of such relationships and how you
can use appropriate coaching, communication, and
teaching skills to achieve positive outcomes for your
programs.

HOW ROLES AFFECT
BEHAVIOR

them responsible for program outcomes, accountable for their own actions, and full participants in
everything that contributes to program success.

When clients seek your help to address their musculoskeletal imbalances, they will naturally view
you as the expert in this field. They will assume the
role of subordinates who will rely on you to provide
the guidance and direction they need to resolve
their issues (Altman, Valenzi, and Hodgetts 1985).
This assumption of roles (and of the behavior that is
expected from each party) is fraught with potential
problems. While you are a specialist in the area of
musculoskeletal assessment and corrective exercise,
immediately assuming the role of expert will reinforce clients’ perception that you (and you alone)
are responsible for fixing their problems. This will
hamper your ability to help your clients to learn and
to gain self-confidence, because they are now relying
on you to take control of every aspect of their program. They may act in very distinctive ways by not
speaking up, becoming disinterested, blaming you
when things are not working out as expected, and
ultimately dropping out of the program. In short, if
clients view you as the expert with all the answers,
your ability to encourage them to participate, learn,
build confidence in themselves, and adhere to their
programs will be greatly diminished (Tyler, Kramer,
and Oliver 1999; Williams 1993).
By the same token, clients who assume the role
of subordinates will usually do whatever the expert
tells them to do, often without question. You may
have seen this yourself when observing another
personal trainer or fitness professional working
with a client. You may have seen a trainer’s clients
lift weights that are too heavy for them or perform
exercises that are unsafe or beyond their abilities
because the trainer instructed them to do so. This
happens because the clients believe it is not their
place to question the expert. While you may wish to
have clients follow your instructions without question, this kind of relationship means that if anything
goes wrong, the clients will blame you. They will
think you should have known better (Tyler, Kramer,
and Oliver 1999).
In addition to being aware of how clients view
each of your roles, there are several other elements
that factor into accurately shaping their expectations. The activities they engage in, any past injuries, surgeries, or diseases they may have had, their
adherence to performing their homework, and their
mindset about their musculoskeletal health and your
ability to help them can all limit progress or hinder
goal attainment. Therefore, to achieve their goals
of becoming pain-free and functional again, clients’
relationships with you must be developed to make

ENCOURAGING CLIENT
PARTICIPATION
You can help clients assume a sense of empowerment for the outcomes of their programs in two
distinct ways:
1. Educate them.
2. Get them to take personal responsibility.

EDUCATION
Since most clients don’t know how to help themselves
overcome their musculoskeletal imbalances, teaching them about their bodies is an effective way to
encourage their participation. Specifically, you can
■■explain how each part of the body works indi-

vidually and with other parts,
■■show them what musculoskeletal imbalances
they are experiencing,
■■discuss how these imbalances affect their muscles and other soft tissues,
■■talk about what they can do to overcome these
limitations, and
■■examine what they might be doing that could
affect the progress of their program.
Once clients begin to understand why they experience pain or movement restrictions, and what may
be contributing to their problems (e.g., sitting at a
desk for eight hours or wearing high-heeled shoes),
they become more aware of the things they are
doing (or not doing, as the case may be) that might
be problematic. This will strengthen their desire to
do things differently (Reeve 2015).

RESPONSIBILITY
You can encourage clients to take responsibility
for the success of their programs by encouraging
them to ask questions, contribute ideas, and offer
information when you discuss their programs. This
will help them feel that they are important to the
process, and it will bolster their confidence and
self-esteem. The more a client’s self-reliance grows,
the more he will contribute to planning the exercise
program and the better his adherence will be (American College of Sports Medicine 2014). When used
consistently, these communication and program
design techniques will have a cascading effect on a
client’s behavior; ultimately, he will feel personally

responsible for achieving his goals. Encouraging
his participation in program design will also have a
direct impact on his mindset, his physical and mental
efforts, and his level of attainment.

FUNCTIONING AS A
FACILITATOR
Shaping client expectations and encouraging client
participation also require you to redefine the part
you play in program design. You may initially assume
an authoritative role in client relationships. However,
you too must adjust your approach. The simplest
and most effective way to do this is to view your role
as that of a facilitator rather than an expert. This
subtle but important shift helps promote teamwork
from the outset.
You can strengthen your role as a facilitator
during consultations and assessments by asking
open-ended questions and paying attention to
clients’ verbal and nonverbal responses. Active
listening (i.e., paying attention to clients’ body
language, having empathy for their situations, and
not just waiting for them to finish talking so you
can say what you want to say) will also enable you
to help clients to identify strategies or changes they
need to make on their own to improve their condition (Brockbank and McGill 2006; Bryant, Green,
and Newton-Merrill 2013; Price 2012). Specific
communication strategies for initial consultations
and exercise sessions will be discussed in detail in
chapters 23 and 24.
While it may be easier and less time consuming to

direct clients to a specific course of action because
you as a professional know what will help them,
their motivation and ultimate success depend on
their making their own decisions. Involving them
in designing their own programs is important to
shaping their expectations and behavior, and it
will help them to understand what you can both
achieve by working together. While you are a source
of professional knowledge and guidance, it is not
your job to solve all of a client’s problems. Be aware
of any tendency you may have to try to step in and
fix things when clients share their stories and complaints. This type of response only positions you as
an expert, not a facilitator. As you listen to clients
share their concerns, and as you ask follow-up questions, you can reduce their anxiety and encourage
them to take responsibility for the things they have
identified that are influencing their musculoskeletal
health (Schwarz 2017).
As you talk or work with clients, issues that may
affect their progress, such as depression, anxiety
disorders, or other psychological conditions, may
come to light. It is not within your scope of practice
to diagnose or treat any psychological or medical
condition, but you should have a referral system in
place to qualified doctors and mental health practitioners who can assist clients when appropriate.

Review of Key Points
In order to design successful corrective exercise programs, you must understand basic human
behavior and motivations in addition to having skills in assessment, anatomy, and exercise.
■■There are two main reasons why people with musculoskeletal imbalances seek assistance

from fitness professionals:
1. They lack the knowledge needed to resolve problems on their own.
2. They lack confidence in their own ability to alleviate their condition.
■■Understanding basic human dynamics and behavior can help you to educate clients and

build their confidence, thereby validating their decision to seek your help.
■■When clients approach fitness professionals for help, they typically assume the role of

someone subordinate to the fitness professional’s expertise. The assumption of subordinate and expert roles affects the way each party views the actions and responsibilities
of the other.
■■To avoid the potential pitfalls of a subordinate-and-expert relationship, view your role

as that of a facilitator instead of an authority figure. Help your clients to understand the
basic principles of designing a corrective exercise program.

■■By adopting a facilitator approach, you can develop a teamwork approach to working

with clients on their programs.
■■Requiring or encouraging clients to contribute ideas and suggestions from the outset will

help build their confidence. As their confidence grows, clients will get more involved in
the process, and they will feel a sense of responsibility for program outcomes.
