## Chapter 18: Static Postural Considerations

CHAPTER 18
Static Postural
Considerations
There are many common postures that people
assume for extended periods of time each day,
including sleeping postures, seated postures, and
standing postures. They vary from person to person
depending on occupation, lifestyle, and hobbies.
However, the cumulative effect of spending time in
certain static postural positions can be devastating
from a musculoskeletal, movement, and myofascial
perspective. Sustained postures have been found to
negatively affect soft tissue structures, joint position,
and movement, leading to musculoskeletal imbalances and pain (Sahrmann 2002). Nonexercisebased strategies to help clients both address and
prevent prolonged postures must be considered
in conjunction with a client’s corrective exercise
program.
The average person spends about six to nine
hours per day sleeping (Plotnik, and Kouyoumdjian
2014). If we sleep in positions that stress certain
body structures or exacerbate musculoskeletal
imbalances, these sleeping postures can eventually
cause pain or dysfunction (Sahrmann 2002). When
we are awake, we may spend an additional seven to
nine hours in a dysfunctional position slumped over
a desk, driving a vehicle, or standing over a table,
workstation, counter, or patient. The remaining six
to ten hours of the day are then typically spent in
positions that compound musculoskeletal issues,
such as sitting on a couch in front of the television
or playing on a computer.

STANDING POSTURES
Although the human body is designed to stand
upright, the environments in which we stand today
and the postures themselves are much different
than our early ancestors experienced (Donatelli
and Wooden 2010). With the advent of the Industrial
Revolution, work speed became of paramount importance, particularly in the manufacturing, agriculture,
and trade industries, and workplace environments
were redesigned to enhance productivity. The lasting result of this innovative time in history is that
unnecessary movements have been eliminated from
most everyday jobs, and superfluous tasks have been
eradicated with the goal of increasing production.
Standing still for long periods of time, especially in
a stressful environment that values speed, increases
biomechanical stresses on muscles, tendons, joints,
synovial fluid, and nerves (Hillstrom and Hillstrom
2007). Constrained standing environments designed
to increase productivity have also helped create
musculoskeletal imbalances. For example, an anterior pelvic tilt is a typical compensation pattern for
continuously leaning forward over a workstation.
Excessive rounding of the spine and shoulders,
internally rotated arms, and a forward position of
the head are also common postural adaptations that
occur when confined in typical modern standing
working environments (DeLisa, Gans, and Walsh
2005; Karwowski 2006; Price and Bratcher 2010).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

The addition of technology and electronic devices
to the modern environment compounds the problem
of prolonged standing with poor posture. In today’s
high-tech society, people spend hours standing
with shoulders rounded, heads forward, and arms
crossed over their torsos using phones and other
handheld devices to browse the Internet or communicate. This recent phenomenon has already
reached epidemic proportions, with much research
devoted to the problematic postural deviations and
pain being caused by such activities (Atkins, Kerr,
and Goodlad 2015).
Machines, electronic devices, and workstations
are not the only things that have affected our standing postures and resulting musculoskeletal health.
The pedestrian surface areas of the world until only
100 to 200 years ago were typically dirt floors, gravel
trails, and uneven paths. Historically, this meant that
standing and walking upright were always paired
with a dynamic and ever-changing environment.
This is vastly different from the smooth, concrete
indoor surfaces, sidewalks, and roads of today. In
the evolutionary scheme of things, smooth surface
areas are a very drastic change for the body to have
to contend with, both when standing still and when
moving around. The musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems are designed to instinctively interact
far more gently with the ground when the foot comes
in contact with or treads upon dynamic surfaces
(Donatelli and Wooden 2010). This is because the
foot must adapt to what it has encountered, and send
signals back to the brain to be wary of the unpredictable terrain it might encounter next. Conversely,
when interaction with the ground can be predicted
consistently because the surface is smooth and
flat, the feet (and brain and body) no longer have
to anticipate what they will encounter. As a result,
contact between the body and the ground becomes
much less stimulating and more forceful.
In adapting to these predictable surfaces, the
feet lose their ability to adjust to dynamic situations
and undulating terrain. More accurately, they adapt
so well to being on flat surfaces that they begin to
habitually flatten out, or overpronate. As a result,
the feet and ankles can no longer function optimally
on the rare occasions when they must navigate
unstable surfaces. You might even have observed this
deterioration of foot and ankle function in yourself.
For example, have you ever gone on vacation to a
place such as the beach, kicked off your shoes, and
headed straight for the sand, only to find that later
that day or evening your feet and legs were cramping and sore? Or perhaps even your back hurt? This
was probably due in part to the fact that your feet

no longer can strongly support you on surfaces like
sand that require the use of all of the muscles in your
toes, feet, legs, hips, and back.
When the feet do not work properly or have pain and
musculoskeletal imbalances, it is difficult and uncomfortable for them to support the full weight of the body.
Consequently, people develop the habit of shifting their
body weight more onto one leg in an effort to distribute
their weight differently and alleviate the discomfort.
However, propping the weight of the body on only one
hip, leg, or foot can cause problematic changes in all
the structures of the body as they adjust to keeping
the body balanced in this perpetually unstable position. Not surprisingly, the cumulative stress of this
fairly recent change in the pedestrian environment
is showing up in the form of myriad musculoskeletal
imbalances (Karwowski 2006).

TIPS TO HELP WITH
STANDING POSTURES
There are many nonexercise-related suggestions
that can help clients to alleviate some of the problems that can arise from standing with poor posture
for long periods of time.
1. Help clients to become aware of any tendencies
they have to chronically shift their weight from
side to side or to prop their weight on one hip,
leg, or foot when standing. For example, it is
quite common for mothers to carry their young
children predominantly on one hip. This can
create heavily ingrained compensatory shifts
in their bodies, especially on the side used to
carry the child. These patterns can continue to
exist long after their children are grown.
2. Educate clients about their footwear choices,
and encourage them to select appropriate
shoes. Radical changes in footwear or adding
orthotics too quickly, however, will cause
additional stress and will likely create other
aches and pains due to tissues and structures
not having sufficient time to adapt. Therefore,
as with any element of an exercise program,
remind clients to adopt the suggested footwear
changes gradually. For more information on
making appropriate footwear recommendations, see Footwear and the Role of Orthotics
later in this chapter.
3. Make clients aware of the positions they assume
with their hands and arms when they are standing. Prolonged positioning of these extremities
can lead to myofascial and musculoskeletal
changes and compensatory movement patterns.


Static Postural Considerations

For example, crossing the arms or resting the
hands in pockets can round the shoulders forward; holding one’s smartphone with one hand
to text can shift the head, neck, and spine to
one side; carrying a bag on one shoulder can tip
the body to one side and shift the body’s center
of gravity; holding a cell phone to one ear while
standing can tip the head to one side and cause
side shifting. Over time, these habits can result
in dysfunction and pain.
4. In cases where clients are forced by their work
environment to stand for extended periods,
encourage them to adjust their body position
continually so that many parts can share the
workload of maintaining an upright position.
For example, you can suggest that clients
switch hands throughout the day when performing repetitive tasks, vary the height of their
workstations, raise or lower their computer
monitors, take their shoes off or change shoes
throughout the day, incorporate hands-free
technology with their telephone, carry tools or
bags on alternating sides of their bodies, and so
on. These subtle changes will provide different
stimuli and will ensure that undesirable longterm postural patterns do not become habitual.
5. Coach clients on the principles of standing
with correct posture. When they stand upright
looking ahead, instruct them to pull their heads
back with their chins in (to minimize a forward
head position and excessive cervical lordosis),
keep the thoracic spine upright and the shoulders pulled back (to minimize excessive thoracic kyphosis and protracted shoulder blades),
tuck the pelvis under (to minimize an anterior
pelvic tilt and excessive lumbar lordosis), and be
aware if they are collapsing their body weight
into their feet (to avoid a valgus knee position
and overpronation). These subtle adjustments
will enable their center of gravity to shift back
into the heels, permit the skeletal structures
to support their weight more correctly, allow
their soft tissue structures to rest, and help
promote a better standing posture. For more
detailed information on standing posture and a
diagrammatic representation of ideal standing
posture, see How the Head and Neck Relate to
the Rest of the Body in chapter 6.

Shoes with heels, such as pumps, high heels, running
shoes, and boots, are designed to be higher in the
back than they are in the front, and these types of
shoes tip the body’s center of mass forward (Greene
and Roberts 2017). Hence, when feet are placed into
shoes that have a standing surface not parallel to the
floor, the entire body has to compensate in order to
avoid tipping over forward. People who wear shoes
with very high heels may even stand or walk with
their knees constantly bent to stop themselves from
falling forward. This continual, sustained flexion of
the knees can, over time, lead to inflammation and
pain and additional musculoskeletal imbalances. An
elevated heel can also cause the back of the pelvis
to tilt up at the back and down at the front (i.e., an
anterior pelvic tilt), resulting in excessive lumbar
lordosis and compensatory shifts all the way up the
rest of the body to the head (see figure 18.1).
High-heeled shoes (and almost all footwear made
for fashion-focused purposes) are also problematic
for the musculoskeletal system for a different reason.
These types of shoes are typically designed to be
narrow toward the front of the shoe, which compresses the toes together. This squeezing together of
the toes narrows the width of the foot and decreases
the base of support for the entire body. As a result,
balance is affected, and the rest of the body must
compensate to maintain an upright and stable posture (Greene and Roberts 2017). Educating clients

FOOTWEAR AND THE ROLE
OF ORTHOTICS
The wrong footwear can contribute to the development of painful and dysfunctional standing postures.

about the effect of heeled shoes on the mechanics
of the body, and encouraging them to wear more
appropriate footwear like neutral-soled or flat-soled
shoes with wide toe boxes, is an important supplement to their corrective exercise program.
Go to the online video to watch video 18.1,
where Justin talks about helping clients
choose the right footwear.

In some cases, arch supports or orthotics, in addition to alternate footwear choices, may be advisable
for clients to address their painful symptoms at
the outset of a corrective exercise program. At the
beginning of the program, their feet and ankles may
benefit from the artificial support. However, as they
progress with the corrective exercises, they should
be able to phase out the use of artificial supports and
begin to rely on their own bodies to support their feet
and ankles naturally (Chinn and Hertel 2010; Price
2014). The use of arch supports, supportive footwear,
and orthotics is usually only recommended as a
long-term solution to specific and diagnosed conditions of the feet and ankles when a licensed medical
professional has said that such devices are needed.

SEATED POSTURES
Prolonged seated postures can have a detrimental
effect on various soft tissue structures and muscles
(Sahrmann 2002). Similar to the changes in our
pedestrian environment discussed previously, the
everyday activities of humans have changed drastically over the past few hundred years. Daily life for
most people in the Western world used to be full of
various activities that required coordinated movements using the entire body. However, the standardization and automation of many tasks, coupled with
huge technological advances in the past 50 years,
has launched humans into a brand-new era where
multiplanar and dynamic movements are greatly
diminished. Instead of being weight-bearing to
accomplish a variety of tasks throughout the day,
people are spending more and more time in seated
positions. Typical days spent sitting down to eat
breakfast, driving to work, sitting at desks looking at
computers all day, riding spinning bikes or performing seated exercises at the gym, driving back home,
sitting down for dinner, and watching TV (or reading) are taking a toll on the human musculoskeletal
system (Hertling and Kessler 2006).
The unique design of the human body enables
people to assume practically any position they
want. However, the body is distinctly designed to

support essential weight-bearing functions that
are performed in an upright position, such as walking. When a person is seated, the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle, thoracic spine, and shoulder girdle, legs, and
feet no longer have to perform some of their major
functions, like extending the hips to support the
torso, keeping the spine erect on top of the hips, and
bearing weight on the feet and ankles. Instead, the
hips remain in flexion, and the body weight is supported by the chair on which the person is sitting.
Since the glutes no longer have to extend the hips,
they soon become dysfunctional and can no longer
perform adequately. The hip flexors also become
chronically shortened and dysfunctional as a result
of sustained hip flexion (McGill 2016). Consequently,
when we stand after a prolonged period of sitting,
the glutes cannot extend the hips effectively, and
the hip flexors are too tight to allow the hips and
spine to extend as they should. Movement to an
erect position is thus initiated incorrectly and by
fewer muscles—for example, the lumbar erectors
overworking to hyperextend the lumbar spine to
pull the torso upright (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Several upper body problems can also develop
as a result of constant and continual sitting. When
a person is seated in front of a computer or in the
driver’s seat of a vehicle, for example, the tasks that
must be performed in those situations require the
arms and hands to be placed across and in front of the
torso. This position of the arms requires the shoulders
to round forward and the thoracic spine to flex, eventually leading to musculoskeletal imbalances such as
excessive thoracic kyphosis, internally rotated arms,
a protracted shoulder girdle, and elevated shoulder
blades (Frontera, Silver, and Rizzo 2015; Price and
Bratcher 2010). These changes in the thoracic spine
and shoulder girdle affect the neck and head, causing
the head to move forward of its optimal position and
the neck to arch backward to keep the eyes aligned
with the horizon or whatever they are focused on (see
figure 18.2). Over time, these sustained postures can
lead to imbalances in the head and neck (i.e., excessive cervical lordosis and a forward head posture)
and resultant pain and dysfunction.

TIPS TO HELP WITH SEATED
POSTURES
There are many nonexercise-related recommendations that can help clients to alleviate some of the
musculoskeletal problems that can arise from sitting
for long periods of time:
1. It may seem impossible in today’s technologically advanced world, but coach clients to sit

down as little as possible. Reducing the overall
amount of time spent in seated positions will
complement the range of exercises you provide
to address the detrimental musculoskeletal
effects of continual sitting. Encourage clients
to get out of their chairs several times a day to
promote hip, leg, and spine extension.
2. Suggest proactive strategies to minimize the
need for sitting, such as converting conventional desks and workspaces to standing desks
or walking instead of driving when possible.
In cases where clients have no choice but to
remain seated, suggest that they use stretches
or myofascial release techniques several times
a day to target some of the undesired effects
that prolonged sitting has on the musculoskeletal system (Higgins 2011; Price and Bratcher
2010).
3. Remind clients who must remain seated for
prolonged periods to check the positioning
and alignment of their computer monitors,
telephones, steering wheels, chairs, televisions,
computer accessories, and keyboards to ensure
that these objects are situated in a manner that
helps keep the spine upright, the head neutral,
and the arms relaxed.
4. Remaining stationary in a fixed posture for any
amount of time can have detrimental effects on
the musculoskeletal system. Encouraging clients to fidget throughout the day when seated
to encourage micromovements and lessen the

negative effects of prolonged sitting may prove
helpful (Weisberg and Shink 2015). Reminding
clients to assume neutral positions of the thoracic spine, neck, and head whenever possible
when seated will also prove beneficial.

SLEEPING POSTURES
Chronic muscular imbalances and myofascial
restrictions that are exacerbated by prolonged
standing and sitting can be made even worse by poor
sleeping postures (Sahrmann 2002). For example,
people with an anterior pelvic tilt and excessive
lumbar lordosis will often have very tight hip flexors; as a result, they may find it difficult to sleep on
their backs, especially with their legs straight. This
is because the combination of an anterior pelvic tilt
and tight hip flexors pulls the lumbar spine even
further forward into extension, creating a greater
arch in the lower back (see figure 18.3). When these
people lie on their backs with their legs straight, the
muscles and fascia in the lower back will compress
and tighten. This can make it uncomfortable to bend
forward and flex the lumbar spine after getting out
of bed in the morning. Furthermore, an anterior
pelvic tilt with excessive lumbar lordosis is also
exacerbated by lying on the stomach (especially if
the mattress is soft) because this places the spine
into extension and tilts the pelvis anteriorly (Wilmink 2010). People with excessive lumbar lordosis
and an anterior pelvic tilt will most likely feel most
comfortable sleeping on their sides.

lumbar lordosis when lying down.

Unfortunately, sleeping on the side of the body
for prolonged periods can create musculoskeletal
problems as well (Simons, Travell, and Simons 1999).
Side sleeping promotes rounding of the shoulders
throughout the night as the arms come across the
front of the chest to meet on top of the mattress. This
position protracts the shoulder blades, especially the
shoulder blade not touching the mattress because it
has to move farther across the torso in order for the
top arm to rest on the bed. In addition, blood supply
to the bottom arm and shoulder is restricted in a side
sleeping posture because of the weight of the body
on the arm (Scheumann 2007). These problematic
sleeping positions can exacerbate musculoskeletal
imbalances in the upper body, causing compensatory
shifts of the pelvis, lower back, hips, and the rest of
the lower kinetic chain upon waking and standing.
Occasionally, you will encounter clients who like
to sleep on their stomachs. People who prefer this
position may be younger clients with an anterior
pelvic tilt and excessive lumbar lordosis who have
not had these imbalances long enough to experience pain. However, it is very important to encourage clients who sleep on their stomachs to change
this habit because it causes the lower back to arch
excessively and the pelvis to tilt anteriorly, and it
leads to habitually rotating the neck and head to

one side. These irregular spine and pelvis positions
will exacerbate (or create) musculoskeletal problems
that may eventually produce pain and dysfunction
(Ombregt 2013; Simons, Travell, and Simons 1999).

TIPS TO HELP WITH SLEEPING
POSTURES
There are many nonexercise recommendations that
can help clients alleviate some of the problems that
can arise from inappropriate sleeping postures:
1. Encourage clients to try to sleep predominantly
on their backs on a firm mattress. The bed
should be firm enough so that neither the lower
back nor the thoracic spine sinks into the mattress. For those who can easily achieve a neutral
lumbar spine, sleeping flat on their backs with
their legs out straight is an ideal sleeping position. However, clients with excessive lumbar
lordosis and an anterior pelvic tilt will find this
position very uncomfortable to maintain. If this
is the case, recommend that they place a wedge
or pillow under their knees to help to posteriorly
tilt their pelvises and flex their lumbar spines
to help keep these structures closer to a neutral
position (Sahrmann 2002). Coach clients to


Static Postural Considerations

start off in this position for just a few minutes a
night, then to gradually increase their time in
that posture. As the myofascial structures of the
lumbar spine begin to adjust, the height of the
pillows under the knees can be lessened. Eventually, they will be able to sleep on their backs
with straight legs and no tightness or discomfort.
2. People with excessive lumbar lordosis also
probably have excessive cervical lordosis.
Therefore, a small pillow should be used to help
keep the head and neck in a neutral position
when sleeping on the back (Simons, Travell,
and Simons 1999). Tell clients to choose a pillow
thickness that puts their eyes in a position
that is perpendicular to the ceiling to properly
support the back head and align the neck. The
pillow thickness should not be so great, however, that it pushes the head up into a forward
head posture.
3. Encouraging clients to sleep on their backs
with their arms at their sides will help promote
thoracic extension and let the shoulder blades
fall into a more neutral, retracted position.
Moreover, sleeping on the back with the palms
up will externally rotate the arms and help mitigate some of the negative effects of maintaining
an internally rotated arm position throughout
the day (Price and Bratcher 2010).

4. Although you should not coach clients to sleep
on their sides, for some people it is inevitable.
If you have a client who insists on sleeping on
her side, have her place a pillow between her
knees to help keep the upper and lower leg in
line with the hip socket, and have her use a
pillow thick enough to keep her neck in line
with the rest of her spine. If the client is willing, encourage her to place a pillow under her
top arm to prevent the arm and shoulder from
rolling inward toward the chest. Finally, remind
her to be aware of the placement of her head
in relation to her neck on the pillow in order
to avoid a forward head position as she sleeps
(Simons, Travell, and Simons 1999).
Myriad structural and soft tissue changes can result
from standing, sitting, and sleeping in malaligned
postures. The impact of prolonged static positions
can be far-reaching and can have a direct effect
on the success of corrective exercise programs.
While it is important to design at-home exercises to
help undo myofascial restrictions caused by these
postures, it is equally important to help clients
to become aware of their posture throughout the
day and to use the nonexercise strategies we have
described to reduce their negative effects.

Review of Key Points
Posture refers to the way a person carries his body or assumes certain static positions.
■■People assume different postures throughout the day that vary depending on their

activities, occupations, and lifestyles. Muscular and fascial restrictions caused by prolonged static postures can lead to painful imbalances, and they should be addressed in
a corrective exercise program.
■■Technological advancements may make life easier, but they are harder on the muscu-

loskeletal system when it must adapt to maintain rigid positions for extended periods.
These problematic advancements include:
–– Smooth, paved, even surfaces for standing and walking
–– Standardization and automation in most trade industries
–– Comfortable office chairs, recliners, couches, and beds
–– Computers, TVs, automobiles, phones, and other handheld devices
■■Standing and walking on dynamic surfaces requires coordinated use of all the muscles

in the ankles, toes, and feet. Muscles and soft tissue structures that have become deconditioned by chronic exposure to flat surfaces and predictable terrain require attention
throughout the course of a corrective exercise program. The recommendation of supportive shoes, arch supports, or orthotics may be helpful at the outset of a client’s program
to reduce their painful symptoms. However, these devices should rarely be considered a
long-term and complete solution to addressing your client’s musculoskeletal imbalances.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

■■Any type of footwear that is higher in the back than in the front is considered a high-

heeled shoe. These types of shoes tip the body’s center of mass forward, which can cause
or exacerbate musculoskeletal imbalances.
■■Sitting for prolonged periods of time can lead to a variety of musculoskeletal problems:

–– Excessive cervical lordosis
–– Excessive thoracic kyphosis
–– Internally rotated arms and a protracted shoulder girdle
–– Weak glutes and thoracic extensors, tight hip flexors
■■Ideally, people should learn to sleep on their backs on a firm mattress. However, this

position may not always be possible for clients to maintain. Provide recommendations to
minimize the postural implications of side sleeping, and encourage clients not to sleep
on their stomachs.
