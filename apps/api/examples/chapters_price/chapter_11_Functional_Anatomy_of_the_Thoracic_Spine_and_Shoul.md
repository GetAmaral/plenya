## Chapter 11: Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

CHAPTER 11
Functional Anatomy
of the Thoracic Spine and
Shoulder Girdle
The thoracic spine is the middle portion of the
spinal column that articulates with the rib cage. The
shoulder girdle connects and moves with this area
of the body through muscles, tendons, ligaments,
and joints (McMinn 2005).

BONES AND JOINTS
The thoracic spine and shoulder girdle is comprised
of the many bones of the upper torso and the 12
vertebrae of the thoracic spine. The scapulae sit on
the back of the rib cage (which is formed by 24 bones
that attach to either side of each of the thoracic vertebrae). The acromion extends outward from the top
of the shoulder blade (via the spine of the scapula)
(see figure 11.1) (Middleditch and Oliver 2005).
The sternum is a broad, flat bone located on the
front of the chest where the ribs come together to
form the front of the rib cage. The clavicle bones
attach to and extend outward from the top of the
sternum (i.e., the sternoclavicular joint) to help
form the upper part of the shoulder girdle with the
acromion (i.e., the acromioclavicular joint). The
end of the humerus articulates with the labrum
and glenoid cavity to form the main shoulder joint
(i.e., the glenohumeral joint) (Siegel 2002). All of
the movements of the shoulder girdle are highly
complex and depend on perfect coordination of all

the bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia
in that area.

SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES
Several soft tissue structures in the thoracic spine
and shoulder girdle assist with and influence movement. This area also contains other soft tissue
structures that assist with essential life functions,
such as breathing, that can be negatively affected
by musculoskeletal imbalances.

DIAPHRAGM
The thoracic diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle
that extends across the bottom of the rib cage (figure
11.2). Unlike other skeletal muscles, the diaphragm
is a membrane surrounded by muscle fibers that
separates the thoracic cavity of the torso (which
contains the heart and lungs) from the abdominal
cavity (which contains the digestive organs). It can
expand and contract like other muscles and, along
with the intercostals, it is the main muscle used for
breathing (Rhoades and Bell 2009).
Breathing in (inhaling) causes the diaphragm
and the intercostal muscles of the rib cage to contract, resulting in an increase of space in the thoracic
cavity. This increase allows the lungs to expand
into the empty space that has been created by the

contraction of those muscles. Once the lungs have
filled with air, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. This reduces the amount of space available in the thoracic cavity and forces air back out
of the lungs (exhalation) (Rhoades and Bell 2009).
In addition to its role in breathing, the diaphragm
helps increase intra-abdominal pressure when
contracted by pushing down on the contents of the

abdomen during movements that require expulsion
such as coughing, sneezing, urination, and defecation (West 2000). This pressure increase during
inhalation further helps to stabilize the lumbar spine
for lifting heavy loads, and it increases blood supply
to the organs, keeping them healthy (Middleditch
and Oliver 2005).


Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES
The group of muscles that lies between the ribs and
facilitates breathing is called the intercostals (figure
11.3). There are 22 individual intercostal muscles, 11
internal and 11 external. The external intercostals
expand the rib cage when they contract, allowing the
lungs to intake air. The internal intercostals, which
are located underneath the external intercostals,
compress the rib cage to expel air from the lungs
(Singh 2005).
Common musculoskeletal imbalances in the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle can have adverse
effects on the way a person breathes. For example,

excessive thoracic kyphosis causes the rib cage
to collapse forward and down, which chronically
compresses the ribs, intercostals, and diaphragm
and makes it more difficult to draw in air. Since we
need air to survive, breathing may be initiated by
other structures when imbalances exist; for example,
the upper rib cage and shoulders may shrug upward
to allow the lungs to expand. This dysfunctional
adaptation can lead to muscle fatigue and musculoskeletal compensation patterns developing in the
shoulders and neck. Therefore, the thoracic spine
and shoulder girdle must be aligned and functioning
correctly to facilitate the act of breathing (Karageanes 2005).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Latissimus Dorsi
Muscle specifics: A broad muscle on the back of the
torso that sweeps upward and across from either side of
the lower back to the top of the arm. It originates from the
spinous processes of the bottom five thoracic vertebrae
and the lumbar vertebrae, the top and sides of the pelvis,
the thoracolumbar fascia, the bottom four ribs, and the
bottom edge of the shoulder blade and inserts at the top
of the arm on the humerus toward the front (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Brings the arm downward behind
the body and rotates it inward. When the arms are fixed,
the latissimus dorsi helps to move the trunk and pelvis
toward the arms (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
latissimus dorsi decelerates the arm as it moves up and
away from the body. It also helps decelerate the trunk as
it moves away from the arms when they are fixed. Due to
its origins on the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and the
fascia of the lower back, it also helps to stabilize the spine.
Real-life movement example: Works in traditional
anatomy terms to pull the arms down and toward the
body during movements like swinging the arms when
walking, chopping downward with an ax, or swimming.
Acts like a bungee cord to help slow down the arms and
torso as they move away from each other during movements like climbing down from a tree.

Latissimus dorsi

E6993/Price/TF11.01/584348/mh-R1

Helpful tips: People who have chronically shortened
latissimus dorsi muscles typically have internally rotated
arms and a protracted shoulder girdle.

Pectoralis Major
Muscle specifics: A muscle that fans across the chest
on the front of the upper torso. It originates from the
fascia of the external obliques, the cartilage of the first
six ribs, and the sternum and medial half of the clavicle.
It attaches to the front of the upper arm on the humerus
(Di Giacomo, Pouliart, Costantini, and De Vita 2008).
Muscle action(s): Lifts the arm up and across the body
and helps rotate the arm inward (Di Giacomo, Pouliart,
Costantini, and De Vita 2008).

Pectoralis
major

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
pectoralis major decelerates the arm as it moves down
and away from the midline of the body. It also helps slow
down the arm as it rotates outward.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to slow down the arm(s) during
movements such as taking a forehand backswing in tennis or reaching
behind you to grab
E6993/Price/TF11.02/584349/mh-R2
something from the back seat of a car.
Helpful tips: During prolonged computer use, the arms must come forward and across
the body to type on the keyboard. This action can chronically shorten the pectoralis major
muscle over time.


Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

Pectoralis Minor
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the front, upper
portion of the torso. It originates from the anterior
portions of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs and
inserts on the coracoid process of the scapula (Di
Giacomo, Pouliart, Costantini, and De Vita 2008).

Pectoralis minor

Muscle action(s): Pulls the shoulder blade down
and forward. If the shoulder blade is fixed, the
pectoralis minor also assists with breathing by elevating the third, fourth, and fifth ribs (Di Giacomo,
Pouliart, Costantini, and De Vita 2008).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of
the pectoralis minor helps stabilize the shoulder
blade against the rib cage when the shoulder blade
retracts and the arm is taken behind the body.

E6993/Price/TF11.03/584350/mh-R1

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to help slow down (and stabilize)
the shoulder blade as the shoulder girdle is put under stress during such movements as
taking a backswing in golf.
Helpful tips: A chronically tight pectoralis minor can protract the scapula, raising the
vertebral border and bottom of the shoulder blade away from the rib cage.

Rhomboids (Minor and Major)
Muscle specifics: Muscles on the back of the
torso between the spine and the shoulder blades.
Both rhomboid minor and major originate from
the upper thoracic spine (and last cervical vertebrae and nuchal ligament for rhomboid minor),
travel on a downward angle to the shoulder blade,
and insert on the edge of the shoulder blade closest to the spine (Rockwood and Matsen 2009).

Rhomboid minor

Rhomboid major

Muscle action(s): Moves the shoulder blades
closer to the spine (i.e., retracts them) (Rockwood and Matsen 2009).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action
of the rhomboids helps slow down movements
of the shoulder blades away from the spine (i.e.,
protraction of the shoulder blades).

E6993/Price/TF11.04/584351/mh-R5

Real-life movement example: Work in a traditional sense during all movements that involve
pulling the shoulder blades toward the spine, like rowing. Act like bungee cords to help slow
down the shoulder blades as they move away from the spine, such as when lowering a box
to the ground or when the arms swing forward when walking.
Helpful tips: People with a protracted shoulder girdle usually have chronically lengthened
rhomboid muscles that cannot contract effectively.

Serratus Anterior
Muscle specifics: A muscle that wraps around the
sides of the upper torso. It originates on the front of
the rib cage from the top eight ribs, travels under the
shoulder blade, and attaches to the border of the scapula closest to the spine (Clippinger 2007).

Serratus
anterior

Muscle action(s): Stabilizes the shoulder blade and
keeps it flat to the rib cage as it moves away from the
spine so the vertebral edge does not protrude outward
(Clippinger 2007).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
serratus anterior decelerates the shoulder blade as it
moves toward the spine (retracts) to help stabilize the
entire shoulder girdle.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee
cord to help slow down the shoulder blades as they
move toward the spine during closed-chain movements
of the arms, such as push-ups and crawling.
Helpful tips: The serratus anterior works as an antagonist to the rhomboid muscles.

Trapezius (Upper Fibers)
Muscle specifics: One portion of a large triangular muscle
on the back of the torso. The upper fibers of the trapezius
originate on the base of the skull, the nuchal ligament on the
back of the neck, and the bottom of the cervical spine, travel
in a downward sweeping motion, and insert on the outside
edge of the clavicle, the acromion, and the spine of the scapula
(Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998).

E6993/Price/TF11.05/584352/mh-R2

Upper trapezius

Muscle action(s): Elevates the shoulder blades. When the
shoulder blades are fixed, it helps extend the neck and head by
pulling the base of the skull closer to the top of the shoulder
blades (Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the upper
trapezius decelerates the shoulder blades as they depress. The
lengthening action of this part of the trapezius muscle also
helps decelerate the neck and head as the head tips down and
forward into flexion.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
slow the downward movement of the shoulder blades during
activities such as lowering a box from a high shelf. The bungee
cord feature of the upper fibers also activates when nodding
the head forward or looking down during activities like texting.
Helpful tips: All three portions of the trapezius muscle perform different functions to help control the shoulder blades as
they move up and down and in and out.

E6993/Price/TF11.06/584353/mh-R1


Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

Trapezius (Middle Fibers)
Muscle specifics: One portion of a large triangular
muscle on the back of the torso. The middle fibers of
the trapezius originate on the last cervical vertebra and
upper part of the thoracic spine, run outward toward the
shoulder blade, and attach to the top of the spine of the
scapula (Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998).

Middle trapezius

Muscle action(s): Pulls the shoulder blades toward the
spine, retracting them (Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
middle fibers of the trapezius decelerates the shoulder
blades as they move away from the spine.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord
to help slow the movement of the shoulder blades as they
travel away from the spine during activities such as bending over and lowering a weight to the ground or trying to
hold a rope at arm’s length during a game of tug-of-war.
Helpful tips: The middle fibers of the trapezius work in
concert with the rhomboids to stabilize, decelerate, and
retract the shoulder blades.

Trapezius (Lower Fibers)

E6993/Price/TF11.07/584354/mh-R2

Muscle specifics: One portion of a large triangular
muscle on the back of the torso. The lower fibers of the
trapezius originate from the middle and lower thoracic
spine, travel upward and outward to the shoulder blade,
and insert near the top of the shoulder blade on the spine
of the scapula (Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998).
Muscle action(s): Pulls the shoulder blade downward
(i.e., depresses it) (Palmer, Epler, and Epler 1998).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
lower fibers of the trapezius decelerates the shoulder
blade as it moves upward.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord
to decelerate the upward movement of the shoulder
blades during activities like the downward phase of
pull-ups or throwing a medicine ball over and behind
your head.

Lower trapezius

Helpful tips: Typically, the lower fibers of the trapezius
are chronically lengthened and weak in people who have
elevated shoulder blades.

Subscapularis (Rotator Cuﬀ Muscle)
Muscle specifics: One of four rotator cuff
muscles of the shoulder. It originates on the
underside of the shoulder blade on the edge
closest to the spine, runs under the scapula
and armpit, and inserts on the front of the
humerus (Clippinger 2007).
Muscle action(s): Responsible for inward
rotation of the arm and taking the arm behind
the body (adduction and extension). It also
helps secure the head of the humerus in the
shoulder joint (i.e., the glenohumeral joint)
(Maffulli and Furia 2012).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord
action of the subscapularis decelerates the
arm as it moves forward, out, and away from
the body. This muscle also helps stabilize the
glenohumeral joint.

Subscapularis

E6993/Price/TF11.09/584356/mh-R1

Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense by rotating the arm inward and
behind you, like when you tuck the back of your shirt into your pants. Acts like a bungee
cord to slow the arm as it swings forward of the body like when clapping your hands and also
helps stabilize the arm in the glenohumeral joint in movements like push-ups.
Helpful tips: Injuries to the rotator cuff muscles are common among baseball pitchers,
tennis players, weightlifters, volleyball players, and other athletes who place the shoulder
girdle and arms under a lot of continued stress.

Supraspinatus (Rotator Cuﬀ Muscle)
Muscle specifics: One of four rotator cuff
muscles of the shoulder. It originates on the
top edge of the shoulder blade closest to the
spine, travels across the top of the shoulder
blade, tucks underneath the acromion, and
inserts on the top of the humerus toward the
outside (Clippinger 2007).

Supraspinatus

Muscle action(s): Raises the arm out to the
side away from the body (i.e., abduction). Also
helps to hold the head of the humerus in the
glenohumeral joint (Maffulli and Furia 2012).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord
action of the supraspinatus decelerates movements of the arm as it is lowered to the side
of the body. It also helps stabilize the head of
the humerus in the glenohumeral joint.
E6993/Price/TF11.10/584357/mh-R1
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense
during movements like lifting
the arm to wave goodbye. Acts like a bungee cord and shoulder joint stabilizer in activities
that require the slowing down of the arm while lowering an object, such as returning the
hand to your side after waving farewell.

Helpful tips: The supraspinatus is the most often injured of the four rotator cuff muscles
because the tendon of this muscle passes under a bone, the acromion, in a highly mobile
area of the shoulder girdle.


Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

Infraspinatus (Rotator Cuﬀ Muscle)
Muscle specifics: One of four rotator cuff muscles
of the shoulder. It originates from the edge of the
shoulder blade nearest the spine, runs upward across
the shoulder blade, and inserts on the top of the upper
arm near the outside of the humerus (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Outwardly rotates the arm. It
also helps stabilize the arm in the glenohumeral joint
(Maffulli and Furia 2012).

Infraspinatus

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of
the infraspinatus decelerates internal rotation of the
arm. It also helps stabilize the head of the humerus
in the glenohumeral joint.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense to help rotate the arm outward during
movements like reaching diagonally behind you into
the back seat of a car. Acts like a bungee cord to slow down the arm as it internally rotates in
activities where the arm swings forward and across the body, such
as when walking or when
E6993/Price/TF11.11/584358/mh-R1
hitting a topspin forehand shot in tennis. It also helps stabilize the arm in the glenohumeral
joint when performing an exercise like the seated row.
Helpful tips: People who always have their arms forward and internally rotated, such
as long-distance drivers or those with computer jobs, likely have chronically lengthened
infraspinatus muscles.

Teres Minor (Rotator Cuﬀ Muscle)
Muscle specifics: One of four rotator cuff muscles
of the shoulder. It originates from the outside edge
of the shoulder blade and inserts on the outside of
the humerus near the top (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Outwardly rotates the arm. It
also helps stabilize the arm in the glenohumeral
joint (Clippinger 2007).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of
the teres minor helps slow down the arm as it moves
forward and internally rotates. It also helps stabilize
the head of the humerus in the glenohumeral joint.

Teres minor

Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense in situations where the arm and hand
are turned upward, like when carrying a tray of
food. Acts like a bungee cord to help slow down the
arm as it comes across and in front of the body—for example, in the follow-through part of
a golf or baseball swing. It also helps stabilize the shoulder during movements like pull-ups.
E6993/Price/TF11.12/584359/mh-R1

Helpful tips: The teres minor and infraspinatus are called external rotator cuff muscles
because, when they contract, they help stabilize the shoulder as the arm rotates outward.
These two muscles can get overly lengthened, irritated, and sore from prolonged rounded
shoulder postures.

Biceps Brachii
Muscle specifics: A dual-headed muscle on the front of the
upper arm. It originates from the top of the scapula, runs
down the arm, crosses the elbow, and attaches to the lower
arm on the radius (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Bends the elbow and supinates the forearm
(i.e., turns the palm upward). Due to its origin on the shoulder
blade, it also helps lift the arm at the shoulder (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the biceps
brachii decelerates the elbow as it straightens and the forearm
as it pronates (i.e., turns the palm down). The biceps brachii
also helps stabilize the shoulder blade.

Biceps brachii

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
help slow down the arm as it straightens and turns inward,
which happens when the arms swing behind the body during
gait or when a ball is thrown. Also helps stabilize the shoulder
blade during these movements.
Helpful tips: People who sit with their elbows bent for
prolonged periods, such as when typing or driving, can have
chronically shortened biceps brachii muscles. When they
try to extend their elbows while walking, the biceps brachii
cannot lengthen effectively, and this can pull the shoulder
blade out of alignment.

brachii muscle works in real-life.

EFFECT OF THE THORACIC
SPINE AND SHOULDER
GIRDLE MUSCLES ON
THE MOST COMMON
MUSCULOSKELETAL
DEVIATIONS
Today’s high-tech environment can have adverse
effects on the structures of the thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle. People often spend hours with their
shoulders and upper backs rounded forward and
their arms internally rotated as they use computer
devices (Plotnik and Kouyoumdjian 2014). When not
at a computer, they are often either driving or sitting
in front of a television. Many people spend most of
their waking hours in a seated, rounded posture.
These prolonged positions can lead to chronic
musculoskeletal imbalances that disrupt function in
the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, causing pain
and affecting arm and torso movements (Sahrmann

2002). The neck, lower back, hips, knees, ankles, and
feet then must compensate for immobility and dysfunction in the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle.
The resulting overuse in these other areas can lead
to more imbalances and pain. So the alignment of
the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle is important
to the entire body.
Here are three examples of how the bungee cord
feature of specific groups of muscles can prevent
the most common deviations of the thoracic spine
and shoulder girdle.

EXAMPLE ONE: THE
LATISSIMUS DORSI AND
PECTORALS
The latissimus dorsi and pectoral muscles work
together to control the movement of the arm and
torso. The latissimus dorsi lengthens like a bungee
cord to slow the arm as it swings forward during gait.
During this forward movement of the arm, tension
in the latissimus dorsi also helps keep the lower
thoracic spine upright (see figure 11.4).


Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

Conversely, the pectorals (minor and major) act
like bungee cords to slow down the arm as it swings
behind the body during gait. Tension in the pectorals
as they lengthen also pulls on the upper part of the rib
cage, keeping it upright and keeping the thoracic spine
extended (see figure 11.5). Therefore, it is the combined working of these muscles during gait that helps
control movement of the arms and shoulder girdle and
keeps the thoracic spine upright, thereby reducing
excessive thoracic kyphosis (Price and Bratcher 2010).

The rhomboids, trapezius, serratus anterior, and
biceps brachii muscles work together to control
movement of the scapula on the rib cage to ensure
correct functioning of the shoulder girdle and arm.
As the arm swings forward during gait, for example,
the shoulder blade rotates up and away from the

spine (i.e., it elevates and protracts). This lifting of
the shoulder blade is initiated by momentum and
contraction of the upper fibers of the trapezius.
The rate at which the shoulder blade elevates is
controlled by the lengthening of the lower fibers of
the trapezius. The middle fibers of the trapezius and
the rhomboids also lengthen during this movement
to slow the protraction of the shoulder blade as it
moves away from the spine (see figure 11.6).
The serratus anterior also helps to control movement of the shoulder blades as the arm swings
forward by helping keep the vertebral border of
the scapula flat so that it glides smoothly over the
ribs as it protracts. Conversely, as the arm swings
behind the body, the serratus anterior lengthens
like a bungee cord to help control the position of
the scapula on the ribcage, and the biceps brachii
lengthens to control the extension of the arm and
to stabilize the scapula (Hertling and Kessler 2006)
(see figure 11.7).
The correct functioning of the trapezius, rhomboids, serratus anterior, and biceps brachii can

minimize the potential for imbalances such as
elevated scapulae and a protracted shoulder girdle.
Moreover, because the function of the shoulder
girdle directly affects the position of the thoracic
spine, these muscles also influence the presence or
absence of excessive thoracic kyphosis (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
Go to the online video to watch video 11.2,
where Justin talks about how dysfunction of
the biceps brachii muscle can affect the most
common imbalances.

EXAMPLE THREE: THE
ROTATOR CUFF MUSCLES
The rotator cuff muscles work together to control
the movement of the humerus in the glenohumeral

joint. When the arm swings forward during gait,
for example, it internally rotates and moves slightly
toward the midline of the body. This turning inward
of the arm is controlled and decelerated by the
bungee cord action of the subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. If these rotator cuff muscles
are chronically lengthened or dysfunctional, they
cannot effectively control the extent to which the
arm moves forward and across the body. Therefore,
these muscles must work properly to minimize the
effects of internally rotated arms.
When the weight of the arms is increased by
holding a heavy object, or when they come in contact with a surface to perform a movement like a
push-up, it is important that all the rotator cuff
muscles effectively stabilize the humerus in the
glenohumeral joint so that the rest of the shoulder
girdle and thoracic spine can function properly
(Hertling and Kessler 2006).


Functional Anatomy of the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

Review of Key Points
Optimal alignment of the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle is important to long-term health.
Since the shoulder girdle articulates with the thoracic spine and rib cage, the shoulders and
arms can be affected by imbalances in these areas.
■■The diaphragm and intercostal muscles attach to the rib cage and are the key muscles

used for breathing. Imbalances in the thoracic spine directly affect the rib cage and thus
can affect a person’s ability to breathe correctly.
■■The rhomboids help retract the shoulder blades and help to correctly align the thoracic

spine and shoulder girdle. Prolonged sitting can result in a protracted shoulder girdle,
which can lead to chronic lengthening of the rhomboid muscles.
■■The trapezius muscles form a large diamond shape that runs downward from the head,

out to the shoulders, and then back inward toward the bottom of the thoracic spine.
The upper, middle, and lower fibers of the trapezius help to elevate, depress, and retract
the scapulae. The upper trapezius also helps extend the neck and head.
■■There are four rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder. Working together, these rotator cuff

muscles help move the arm and stabilize it in the glenohumeral joint.

Self-Check
The following exercise is designed to increase your awareness of daily activities that might
