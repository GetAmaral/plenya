## Chapter 27: Marketing Your Corrective Exercise Services

CHAPTER 27
Marketing Your Corrective
Exercise Services
As your corrective exercise skills and professional
reputation develop, you must start considering marketing strategies to effectively promote your business. Marketing a business is not just about launching a website, handing out brochures, and offering
everyone you meet a business card. It is a thoughtful
process designed to educate potential clients in a
manner that encourages them to purchase what you
have to sell, make current clients feel better about
patronizing your business, and increase potential
referrals (Hayes 2012; Silk 2006).

UNDERSTANDING HOW
MARKETING WORKS
Successful marketing takes time and effort, and it
can also cost a lot of money. Therefore, your marketing efforts should be deliberate, well-prepared,
and focused on a specific audience. Developing an
effective marketing strategy requires an in-depth
appreciation of the things that make your business
unique. This includes your business processes, your
current customer base, your competition, your current services and products, any services you plan to
add, and the needs and wants of potential clients.
The particulars of these elements of your business
will have a direct impact on the way you market it.
This chapter presents some simple assessments
and activities you need to conduct in order to gather
this information about your business so that you

can develop an effective marketing strategy. They
are as follows:
■■Conducting a SWOT analysis
■■Considering your competitive edge
■■Defining your service features and benefits
■■Surveying your current clients
■■Developing a value proposition statement

Gathering this valuable information will help you
to understand your current business position and to
identify those aspects of your business that should be
highlighted with your marketing efforts. It will also
help you to identify any weaknesses in your operations that need improving, as well as opportunities
that you can capitalize on (Hall 2003).

CONDUCTING A SWOT
ANALYSIS
A SWOT analysis is a simple but effective tool commonly used in the development of marketing plans.
It is used to assess your business strengths and
weaknesses and to determine the opportunities
and threats you may encounter as you try to attract
clients to your corrective exercise services. Conducting this type of business assessment can help you
focus your marketing activities on areas where you
can derive the most benefit. This type of analysis is
also an effective way to determine what parts of your

business are helping you to move forward and what
parts may be holding you back. It can also help you
to predict potential problems so you can attend to
them before they disrupt your business (Hall 2003).
The best way to complete a SWOT analysis is by
answering the following questions and recording
your responses. The more thought you put into this
assessment of your business, the more it will help
you in developing your marketing plan.

IDENTIFY YOUR BUSINESS
STRENGTHS
■■What advantages do you have over peers in your

community or industry?
■■What do you do well?
■■What do others see as your strengths?
■■What relevant resources do you have access to?

Consider these questions as they pertain both to you
and to your competitors. For example, if all of your
competitors offer corrective exercise programs, then
the provision of corrective exercise services is not
considered a strength; it is a market expectation.
However, if you are one of only a few professionals in
your business area with a corrective exercise background or qualification, then you should consider
that a strength.

IDENTIFY YOUR BUSINESS
WEAKNESSES
■■What can you do to improve your business skills,

communication techniques, or networking
abilities?
■■How strong are your qualifications or certifications?
■■What things do you do badly?
■■What do you (or should you) avoid doing?
■■What makes your business vulnerable?
Consider your responses carefully and from every
perspective. For example, what do your competitors
do better than you? What would your clients say
you need to improve? An honest assessment of your
weaknesses will help you to target areas for growth
and development.

IDENTIFY YOUR BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES
■■What are the industry trends in corrective exer-

cise at the moment?

■■What networking opportunities are you aware

of or can you create?
■■Does the use of technology factor into your
business?
■■What kinds of local events are happening in
your area?
■■Whom do you know who can be a resource or an
asset (and do they owe you favors)?
Think carefully about whether your identified
strengths can open up any additional opportunities
for your business. For example, if you have contacts
in the hotel and hospitality industry, you could discuss with these people the possibility of creating
in-room, spa-like bundles in order to provide guests
with corrective exercise self-massage treatments.
You should also ask yourself if opportunities might
present themselves by eliminating your previously
identified weaknesses. If you are not very well versed
in the nuances of social media, could you open up
new marketing opportunities by educating yourself
on the topic, or hiring someone part-time to help
you set up and manage your social media platforms?

IDENTIFY THREATS TO YOUR
BUSINESS
■■What is your competition doing?
■■What is your cash flow situation like?
■■What business obstacles do you face?
■■Can any of your weaknesses threaten the suc-

cess of your business?
Identifying those things that could negatively affect
your business can enable you to sidestep adversity.
For example, if all of your competitors offer free
consultations but you do not, you should investigate
whether your decision not to do so is perceived positively or negatively by potential customers. If your
target customers expect free consultations, your
decision not to offer them may prove to be a threat
to your livelihood.

DEFINING YOUR
COMPETITIVE EDGE
A competitive edge refers to the characteristics
of your business that make you stand out over the
competition (Hall 2003). Pinpointing your competitive edge is a valuable exercise because once you
determine what your business has that others do not,
you can highlight that in your marketing materials
to attract potential customers and even entice them
away from the competition.


Marketing Your Corrective Exercise Services

To determine your competitive edge, consider
how you and your business differ from others in your
area. An obvious example is that you might be the
only person in your community who offers corrective
exercise services. While this is certainly an advan-

tage, it would be helpful from a marketing standpoint
to clarify this point in more detail. For example, in
addition to being the only corrective exercise service
provider, you may have documented success helping
clients specifically overcome lower back pain so they

SWOT Example
The following SWOT analysis is for a selfemployed personal trainer who currently sees
regular personal training clients and runs a
few boot camps per week. She also intends
to add dedicated corrective exercise services
as one of her offerings.
Strengths

• As a sole proprietor (and my own boss),
I can adjust my services as needed to
meet the needs of my clients.

• My current workload enables me to
devote time to clients and provide
exceptional customer service.

• I have a good reputation in the gym

where I am an independent contractor.

• I am mobile, so I can travel to clients’
homes if necessary.

• My overhead costs are low, so I can offer
value to my clients and have money to
spend on quality marketing materials.

• I am one of the only personal trainers

in my community who has a structured
approach to corrective exercise.

Weaknesses

• Outside of my current clients, I have
very little market presence in the
community.

• When I am sick or out of town, I do not
get paid (and my clients also suffer).

• My cash flow is unreliable due to
fluctuations in my client load.

• The gym I work out of is noisy and is not
conducive to helping clients who have
corrective exercise needs.

• I do not market myself as a trainer with
specialty skills.

Opportunities

• The field of corrective exercise is

greatly expanding, and there are many
opportunities for success.

• My competitors are slow to realize this
expanding market opportunity.

• People are discouraged with the

traditional approaches to helping to
alleviate musculoskeletal pain and
dysfunction.

• Boot camp classes are popular, but
people do not want to get injured.

Threats

• People are using the Internet to find
exercises for their musculoskeletal
problems.

• People tend to use physical therapy

instead of corrective exercise because it
is covered by insurance.

• Routine prescription of pain medication
may lessen the demand for corrective
exercise.

The results of this trainer’s SWOT analysis
enable her to understand her strengths
and where she can capitalize on her
opportunities. This may prompt her to create
a market presence in her community by
promoting her corrective exercise services
and “injury-free” boot-camp classes at
the gym where she sees clients. If it is not
feasible for her to see additional clients or run
specialty classes in her current workspace,
her independence, schedule flexibility, and
access to a vehicle would allow her to provide
mobile corrective exercise services and
classes. As her corrective exercise clientele
and service roster grows, she may consider
opening her own facility to create an optimal
teaching and training environment.
In reviewing her weaknesses and threats,
she may realize the advantage of advertising
her services as personalized, unlike the
cookie-cutter approach of Internet-based
program suggestions. She may also come
to realize that rather than viewing physical
therapists as a business threat, she can
network with them to act as a referral source
once a client has been discharged from
physical therapy. (For more on networking,
see chapter 28.)

can return to working out regularly. Alternatively,
you may have strong relationships in place with
the medical community. Or, if you are not the only
professional in your business area with corrective
exercise expertise, you might be the only one who
has a recognized certification or the only one who
specializes in helping professional athletes.
Being aware of your competitive edge is obviously
helpful for making marketing decisions. However, it
is also a valuable way to determine where your time
and resources should be spent on further developing
those skills you need to make sure you always stay
ahead of the competition (Hall 2003).

IDENTIFYING FEATURES AND
BENEFITS
All of the services you now offer (or plan to offer in
the future) have features and benefits. The features
of your corrective exercise services are the characteristics that describe your offerings (e.g., you use
self-myofascial release [SMR] exercises). The benefits of your service are the positive value that the
features bring to your customers (e.g., the benefits
of SMR exercises include increased range of motion
and decreased pain). Understanding the difference
between features and benefits, and knowing which
of these to highlight in your marketing messages,
will prove helpful when the time comes to create
your promotional pieces (Kuzmeski 2010).
Creating a list of features and benefits for your
service offerings is useful for two reasons:

1. It compels you to take stock of the types of
services you offer.
2. You can use the information from this assessment to develop compelling marketing and
advertising messages.
The best way to discern the benefits of your
corrective exercise services is to think about and
list their unique features. Once you have identified
what the features are, you can extract all the possible benefits of those features to describe how they
will appeal to customers. Figure 27.1 provides an
example of some features and benefits of corrective
exercise services in general.
Effective marketing typically emphasizes the
benefits of a service rather than the features
because these benefits are what customers really
want (Kuzmeski 2010). For example, consider a yoga
instructor who plans to offer a corrective exercise
stretching class along with her traditional yoga
classes. A feature of the special class is static and
dynamic stretching exercises based on the concepts
of functional anatomy. However, potential clients
probably will not be interested in the stretching
exercises themselves or their scientific justification; they are more interested in the benefits (pain
relief and increased mobility) that the stretches can
bring them. Therefore, although this instructor may
mention the features of her stretching class in her
advertising materials, the focus should be primarily
on the benefits clients will receive from attending
the class.

Marketing Your Corrective Exercise Services

EXAMINING YOUR CURRENT
CLIENT BASE

CREATING A VALUE
PROPOSITION STATEMENT

If you already have a strong client base, you may
wonder why you need to assess your business to
develop a marketing strategy at all. This may be a
valid point if you are never interested in expanding your services, increasing your revenue, or
knowing for certain that your client base will not
shrink. However, if you want to raise your rates,
grow your business, and improve your reputation
as a corrective exercise service provider, you must
continue to improve your understanding of your
target market. Asking clients directly for input,
either in person or in a survey, about what they
want, what they would like to have available, and
why they choose to work with you will give you
the answers you need to satisfy both current and
future customers.
The following questions can be used to help you
gather information from your existing client base:

The final assessment activity to help you focus your
marketing strategy is to state the aims and objectives
of your business in terms of the unique value you
offer to clients (e.g., injury prevention, injury recovery, pain relief, performance enhancement, maintenance). This statement is called a value proposition.
Creating a value proposition statement helps direct
your marketing strategies by assessing and defining
your target market group, the benefits you offer, and
the relative pricing of your services in relation to
your competitors (Schultz and Doerr 2011).
Here is an example of how a personal trainer with
the business name Advantage Fitness could phrase
a value proposition statement to include corrective
exercise services:

■■Do you have any musculoskeletal or movement

limitations that are affecting your ability to exercise or enjoy daily activities? If so, what kind(s)
of problems do you experience, and what do you
currently do about it?
■■Do you seek professional help for these prob-

lems? If so, who do you see?
■■Are you satisfied with the service you receive

from these other professionals? If so, what do
you like about their service?
■■If you are not satisfied with the services you

receive, what could the service provider do
differently to make you more satisfied?
■■How important is it that you address your

musculoskeletal imbalances and get rid of your
aches and pains?
■■What could I do to help you with these problems?
■■What could I do differently to help you in gen-

eral?
■■What are you prepared to do to help alleviate

your musculoskeletal problems?
Assessing your existing client base will help you
to appreciate what your current (and potential)
clientele want and need from a corrective exercise
provider. It also keys you in to what may be currently
missing from your business in terms of corrective
exercise services so you can tailor your future
offerings and marketing strategies accordingly
(Humbatov 2015).

Advantage Fitness offers busy executives
convenient, mobile exercise services that help
alleviate muscle and joint pain and improve
fitness at an exclusive price point.
In this example, the target market is clearly defined
(i.e., executives pressed for time). The benefits of
the services are also identified (i.e., mobile services
that save the customer time by not having to travel,
exercise programs that improve fitness as well as
alleviate muscle and joint pain), and there is a clear
indication that the cost for the services is going to
be high (i.e., exclusive) compared to other providers.
When using your value proposition statement to
develop and implement your marketing strategy, it
is important that your marketing messages accurately reflect the stated elements of your business.
Every part of your value proposition—target market,
benefits, and pricing—should be communicated
through your advertising, promotions, positioning, public relations, customer service policies,
networking, and day-to-day operations (Schultz
and Doerr 2011). For example, the value proposition statement for Advantage Fitness would direct
them to use high-quality, professionally created
advertising and promotional materials that reflect
their exclusive price point and exceptionally high
levels of customer service. It would also require that
they use name-brand equipment, have recognized
and respected qualifications in corrective exercise,
drive a nice vehicle (since it is a mobile business),
have excellent punctuality and time-keeping skills,
be able to accept credit card payments, and other
such considerations that would echo the message
promised in their value proposition statement.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Developing a value proposition statement can
be challenging, but it is one of the most important
assessment activities because it requires you to have
a precise understanding of your business objectives.
Identifying your business aims and stating them in
terms of what you will deliver (and to whom and at
what price) is an excellent way to direct marketing
decisions (Schultz and Doerr 2011).

CREATING MARKETING
MESSAGES
Once you have completed the assessment of all the
unique qualities of your business and know the
image you want to present to consumers, it is time
to begin creating content and selecting methods
for distributing your marketing messages. This will
include the content itself and the vehicles you will
use to inform and attract your target market, such as
your website, brochures, or word-of-mouth advertising (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Marketing messages are the verbal, nonverbal,
and written communications used to attract potential customers and keep current customers satisfied
(Kuzmeski 2010). While everyone’s message will be
unique, the process by which the marketing content
is produced is similar for everyone. Use the information from your SWOT analysis, your features and
benefits chart, your competitive advantage summary, your current client analysis, and your value
proposition statement to develop the core content
for your marketing materials. Focus on the following aspects:
1. Emphasize the positive traits of your business.
2. Identify the specific yields your services can
provide for both current and prospective clients.
3. Capitalize on elements that differentiate your
business from the competition.
4. Maintain continuity of content across all your
messages.

EVALUATING DELIVERY
METHODS
As you create your marketing messages, you must
decide how you will get this information to your
intended audience. There are many distribution
channels you can use, ranging from inexpensive
options such as social media to very costly options
like running your own infomercials on television.

Most delivery methods fall at various points along
the cost spectrum. Websites, email marketing campaigns, brochures, newspaper and magazine ads,
flyers, and press releases are all delivery methods
that can vary in price. Before putting energy and
money into developing and distributing your messages, revisit the research you have already done
on your business and potential market to help you
to narrow your options. Also consider the following
questions when choosing what delivery methods
to use:
■■How does your target market spend their

time? Thinking about the ways in which your
potential customers spend their time will help
you to figure out the smartest ways to get your
marketing messages in front of them. For example, if your target market consists of retired
professionals who mostly stay at home, consider
how they might spend a typical day. If they read
magazines, check the mail, and occasionally go
to health-related appointments, then the use of
direct mail postcards or newsletters, circulars or
flyers, or advertisements in relevant magazines
or local newspapers might be good distribution options for your business. You might also
consider networking with other health professionals who serve your target market or make
brochures available at their offices (Cynthia
2012; Urquhart-Brown 2008).
■■What distribution methods will emphasize

your skills and services? When considering
ways to persuade customers to buy your services, choose distribution methods that will
present your business and your skills in the best
possible light. For instance, if you have a knack
for developing warm relationships with people
as you help them with personal matters related
to their musculoskeletal health, this would be
something you would want to highlight in your
marketing materials. Pictures or videos that
show you working with relaxed and satisfied
clients would likely help potential customers
with similar issues feel comfortable about
approaching you (Cynthia 2012).
■■What kind of message do you want to send
potential customers? Your target market’s
opinions and attitudes will greatly influence
their perception of your marketing pieces,
so take that into account when determining
which distribution methods to use. For example, if you plan on marketing private corrective
exercise sessions to very successful business
professionals (who have a lot of discretionary


Marketing Your Corrective Exercise Services

income), then the marketing and distribution
channels you choose must give the impression
that your services are exceptional and worth the
amount of money you intend to charge. Flyers
taped to car windshields or brochures delivered
to receptionists are not going to convey that
message. In fact, such distribution choices may
have the opposite effect, so you must evaluate
whether these choices are congruent with your
marketing messages (Cynthia 2012).
■■How much money do you have to spend?
The most vital aspect of deciding what distribution method(s) to use for your marketing
messages is how much you can reasonably
afford to spend. It does not matter how appealing a distribution method may appear, or how
many potential customers may be exposed to
it. If you spend more than you can afford, your
business might go bankrupt before you can see
any return on your marketing efforts (Price and
Bratcher 2012).

IMPLEMENTING YOUR
MARKETING STRATEGY
Creating the content for your marketing strategy
and choosing the best delivery methods for your
marketing messages is an extensive, but invaluable
process. To help you evaluate the best distribution
techniques for you and your business, and the most
effective way to use them, some of the most popular
methods are described next.

WEBSITES
In chapter 26, you learned about the importance of
having an online presence in today’s marketplace
and some basic website tactics for informing both
potential and current clients about your new skills.
As you further expand and distribute your marketing messages, you will need to revisit your website
to update the content, redesign its structure (if
necessary), and employ strategies to maximize your
website’s search engine exposure (Rieva 2001).
When you begin the process of refining or building your site, first determine what the main purpose
of the site will be. Decide whether you want to use
your website to
■■be a first point of contact for interested pros-

pects,
■■sell corrective exercise products and services,

■■interact with customers (e.g., through the use

of a forum or members-only area), or
■■serve mainly as a virtual information display.
Understanding the primary marketing function
of your site will make it easier to develop or adjust
the content (Rieva 2001). Once you have decided
what type of site to build (or rebuild), seek out a
reputable web design company to help you. If you
want to be able to make changes and updates to
your website yourself once it is complete, ask your
designer to include a content management system
or administrative portal in conjunction with the site
(Rieva 2001).
The use of relevant keywords that correspond to
your site content is what enables well-designed websites to appear higher in search engine results than
others. This is important because sites that appear
higher in search engine results are more likely to be
seen and visited by potential customers (Shepherd
and Augenti 2012). If you decide to submit your site
for paid inclusion to search engines like Google or
Yahoo!, you will need to generate a list of relevant
keywords or phrases that describe your business so
search engine robots can find and rank your site.
When you create your list of keywords, do not just
use words or phrases that include your name, professional label, credentials, or the processes you use
to help clients. Remember that potential customers
are more interested in their own musculoskeletal
problems than in your resumé, and they will search
for services using keywords that relate to their problems. The keyword search engine optimization site
Semrush.com, for example, reported that on March
31, 2017, the term “lower back pain” was searched on
the Internet 330 times more often than “corrective
exercise specialist.” (Keyword Magic Tool, Semrush,
accessed March 31, 2017, https://www.semrush.com/
features/keyword-magic-tool/) You can generate a
list of useful keywords or phrases for your website
by identifying words that focus on your prospects’
problems. Once you have exhausted that list, think
of words that describe the solution to their problems
(i.e., the benefits of your services). There are several
online tools that can help you find words and phrases
that your prospects are interested in. You can also
use these services to test phrases and words to find
out which ones are most often used by people for
Internet searches (Neuman 2007).
In additional to optimizing your site’s keywords
and content, linking (and backlinking) your website to the most popular social media platforms (i.e.,

395


396

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) will also raise your
search engine visibility (Shepherd and Augenti
2012). Potential customers often use social media
when searching for services, and you can use this
to your advantage. Furthermore, linking to social
media platforms will enable you to easily update
your customers about developments with your
business, provide them with useful information, or
generally keep you and your business in the forefront of their minds. Encouraging current clients
to share your social media feeds with their friends,
families, and colleagues is also a terrific way to
encourage new referrals (Price and Bratcher 2012).
If you are unsure how to set up or create quality
social media platforms, ask your website designer
to include this as part of the website development
service.

PRESS RELEASES
Another excellent way to inform people of your
new or expanding corrective exercise services is to
send out press releases to local television stations,
community magazines, and newspapers (Hiam
2014). The submission of press releases to media
outlets is a free distribution method you can use to
build potential hype around you and your business.
There are also online press release companies that
provide press release services for a fee. Regardless
of whether your choose paid or free release services,
bear in mind that media outlets typically receive
press releases in abundance, so make sure the content of your release is unique and interesting from
a news and marketing perspective. A press release
should contain the following elements:
■■The date of your release and the words “For

Immediate Release”
■■A catchy headline that sums up the contents

of the release
■■Information about you and your business that

is newsworthy from a particular media outlet’s
perspective (e.g., notify local TV and newspapers that your business won a national corrective
exercise award)
■■A summary of the who, what, where, when, and

why of your announcement in the first paragraph
and a brief expansion of the details in the following paragraph(s)
■■Concise and easy-to-read content with no gram-

matical or punctuation errors
■■Information and details on the person to contact

for further information

■■A separate section in the release that summa-

rizes your company background information
and contact details

MASS MARKETING
CAMPAIGNS
If you plan to offer generalized services such as
weight loss in association with your corrective exercise services, and you intend to appeal to a broad
market of clients with similar needs, you might
want to consider implementing a mass marketing
campaign (Frazer-Robinson 2003). Mass marketing promotion is designed to get your name out to
as many potential customers as possible through
the use of distribution channels such as television,
radio, flyers, direct mail, print ads, email campaigns,
and Internet-based ad promotions through sites like
Facebook and YouTube. While it can potentially be
an effective way to distribute your marketing message, the outlay for these channels can be costly. It
is also important to remember that although mass
marketing campaign messages may be received by
many people, it does not mean that the leads generated by such campaigns will translate into paying
customers (Frazer-Robinson 2003). If you choose
to deploy a mass marketing campaign, it is critical
to ensure that all the elements of that campaign
match the image you wish to convey due to the vast
numbers of people who will be exposed to it.

WORD-OF-MOUTH
ADVERTISING
The most valuable distribution method for your
marketing messages is word-of-mouth marketing. It
is, by far, the most effective way of getting and keeping business referrals—and it is virtually free! The
best way to generate word-of-mouth marketing is to
provide clients with program success, exceptional
customer service, and positive experiences every
time you interact with them (Friedmann 2009).
You can then draw on the positive experiences of
those clients (or family members or friends you
have helped with their musculoskeletal issues) to
establish new business. Many of your clients, friends,
family members, and colleagues love to talk about
their involvement with you, so give them an excuse
to do so. Here are some ways to do this:
■■Encourage clients to invite friends, family

members, spouses, or work colleagues to attend
sessions with them so these potential customers
can witness your expertise in person.


Marketing Your Corrective Exercise Services

■■Use client workbooks to inspire word-of-mouth

■■You can target your marketing specifically to

marketing for your business to potential customers who might see these materials in use
by one of your clients. Consider branding each
page of the workbook with your business name
and logo, or including informational pages about
The BioMechanics Method process, because this
is an excellent way to add value to your services
and promote your business.
■■Offer incentives for referrals such as free
T-shirts, free sessions, or discounted rates to clients who refer their friends. Similarly, developing
professional networking relationships with the
medical community is a great way to cultivate
word-of-mouth referrals (see chapter 28).

people who have chronic musculoskeletal issues,
thereby reducing marketing costs and achieving
a better return on your efforts.
■■You can charge higher fees that reflect your
specialty services.
■■You can focus your education efforts purely on
corrective exercise and biomechanics to improve
your skills and streamline your continuing education requirements, both of which will lead to
increased client success and increased revenue
for your business.
■■You will have a platform from which to be recognized as an industry expert, and you will be
able to develop secondary revenue streams by
presenting, writing, and educating others about
corrective exercise.
■■You can work less and have more time to pursue
leisure activities and interests as your rates
increase with your elevated status.

Many small businesses pay lip service to the
importance of marketing, but they do not spend
the required time or invest the necessary capital
to create the right type of exposure for their businesses. However, just as you need to practice your
corrective exercise assessment, anatomy, and program design skills, you must continually improve
your marketing know-how to ensure a steady stream
of customers. By frequently reexamining your service offerings, communicating with clients to understand their needs, predicting future requirements,
paying attention to what your competition is doing,
and adapting to evolving trends in the industry, you
can tailor your marketing messages and the way you
deliver them to constantly improve your marketing
skills and promotional efforts.

where Justin talks about how to market your
corrective exercise skills.

TRANSITIONING TO A
FULL-TIME CORRECTIVE
EXERCISE SPECIALIST
As you continue to experience success by applying
your expertise and marketing yourself effectively,
the demand for your services will grow. Eventually,
there may come a time when you need to make a
decision about the direction you would like your
business to take. If you are enjoying your standing as a specialist in corrective exercise, it may
be advantageous to become a full-time corrective
exercise service provider. Narrowing your business
focus to specialize exclusively in corrective exercise
has many benefits:

Making the decision to transition to a full-time
corrective exercise specialty business can be a very
profitable one. However, in order to realize your full
business potential as a specialist provider in corrective exercise, you must continue to take a calculated
approach to developing your image as an expert in
the field and positioning your business as a leader
in the industry.

As with any type of specialist, clients want to know
that the people they are working with are indeed
qualified to do what they are doing. Obtaining a
corrective exercise specialty certification from a
reputable education provider in the fitness industry (and keeping your certifications current) is an
absolute must if you plan to be a full-time corrective
exercise provider. You will also need to update your
qualifications on a regular basis.

CONCENTRATE YOUR
BUSINESS AIMS
In order for consumers to instantly recognize you
as a successful corrective exercise provider, every
component of your business will need to reflect your
commitment to corrective exercise. This includes
your marketing materials, website, newsletters,
social media efforts, continuing education courses,
speaking engagements, and media opportunities.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Restricting your business focus to your area of
expertise will help concentrate your operations as
well as increase your perceived value as a specialist
practitioner of corrective exercise.

RESTRUCTURE YOUR CLIENT
PROFILE
If you have operated a successful health and fitness
business for quite some time, you will likely have
established clientele on your appointment rosters
who are not corrective exercise service clients. If
you intend to become a full-time corrective exercise specialist, begin the process of transitioning or
reducing the number of sessions “traditional” clients
come to see you for non–corrective exercise services.
It is also important that you reshape the programs
of these clients so that you help them primarily
with corrective exercise needs and raise their rates
progressively to meet your current fees. While this
may be a difficult and uncomfortable challenge for
you, this restructuring of your business will cement
your reputation as a corrective exercise specialist,

allow you to attract quality referrals, and enable you
to increase your rates accordingly. You can refer
your non–corrective exercise clients to other professionals (such as a personal trainer, nutritionist, or
weight loss specialist) as you restrict your services
to corrective exercise. You will likely find that these
colleagues will, in turn, begin referring clients with
musculoskeletal limitations to you for specialty corrective exercise services.

OPEN YOUR OWN FACILITY
When you have enough revenue and a solid roster
of clients, you might consider opening your own
corrective exercise facility. This will give you the
opportunity to design your workspace to fully
accommodate corrective exercise clients and brand
your business to reflect the specialty services you
offer. Operating your own facility can be more costly
than other workplace arrangements, but it can also
help you to create an unmistakable professional
image as a specialist and open up many possibilities
for additional revenue streams (Rieva 2001).

Review of Key Points
Marketing your corrective exercise services effectively requires you to take an in-depth look
at your business, your current offerings, your competition, and the needs of your client base.
Once you have completed this assessment of your business, use that information to develop
attention-grabbing and persuasive marketing messages, and implement them in ways that
will attract customers and support your business growth.
■■Completing a SWOT analysis will help you to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses

and any threats or opportunities you may have in the market.
■■The creation of a value proposition statement will help you to be clear about the image

you want to project for your services and to whom you will offer them.
■■Assessing your business rivals enables you to pinpoint the competitive advantage you

have over them in order to cultivate a unique image for your corrective exercise business.
■■All services have features and benefits. Potential clients are typically more interested in

benefits than in features, so emphasize those in your marketing messages.
■■Researching current and potential customers enables you to evaluate precisely how

your business can satisfy their needs, and it helps determine what specific niche your
services fill in the marketplace.
■■The distribution options you choose for your marketing messages will vary depending

on your target market and the goals of your marketing campaign. Choose options that
accurately reflect your business image and that fall within your budget.
■■The most productive of all marketing channels is word of mouth. You can generate this

type of marketing by providing exceptional customer service, concrete results, and positive experiences every time you interact with clients and potential customers.
