CHAPTER 14
Elements of Corrective
Exercise Programs
Chronic imbalances can affect the health and condition of all musculoskeletal structures, including
the bones, joints, muscles, fascia, tendons, and
ligaments. Therefore, the corrective exercises you
recommend must first promote the rest, recovery,
and rejuvenation of all structures you identified as
problematic during the assessment process. You
must then help these areas regain function, health,
and suppleness by introducing corrective exercises
to retrain, reinforce, and strengthen them in order
to improve the overall health of the musculoskeletal
system, and curtail future problems.
Many things factor into the selection of appropriate corrective exercises for your clients’ programs. In
addition to choosing safe and effective techniques,
you must also address clients’ practical and emotional needs and abilities, and the exercises you
recommend should build their confidence (Price and
Bratcher 2010). You must also know how to introduce
corrective exercises in a logical sequence so that
clients can achieve the greatest possible benefits in
the least amount of time.

BUILDING CLIENT
CONFIDENCE
When clients first come to you to discuss their goals
or the musculoskeletal issues they are experiencing,
understand that they have probably been concerned
about it for some time. As a result, they may have
lost confidence in their ability to perform certain

activities, especially those that require the use of
the affected or painful areas (Bandura 1986).
Bearing this in mind, it is important to build
clients’ confidence when you first introduce them
to corrective exercise. This is best done by taking
the time to listen to their concerns and answering
their questions honestly, avoiding the use of technical jargon. Proceed slowly at first, and use different
teaching approaches as you explain each technique
and the corrective exercise process in general. If you
notice that a client appears confused, is not asking
questions, or is simply agreeing with everything
you say—or if he seems overenthusiastic—do not
assume that he understands (Fuller 2004). These
types of responses often indicate just the opposite.
Clients who lack confidence in their abilities are
less likely to tell you when they do not understand.
Learning to recognize when a client is feeling anxious or overwhelmed will allow you to address these
issues as they arise, gain the client’s trust, and build
a positive, long-lasting relationship (Whitworth et
al. 2007).
In addition to addressing clients’ concerns about
their physical condition, you can boost their confidence by choosing easy-to-perform exercises at
the outset of the program. When they can try and
successfully perform a new corrective exercise, their
self-confidence increases. This will motivate them
to repeat the action (i.e., it will increase their adherence), and it will make them more likely to try the
next exercise you ask them to perform (Feltz 1992;
Rejeski 1992).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Remember, the guiding principle of corrective
exercise programming is the same as that of traditional fitness programs: gradual progression (Bryant
and Green 2010). This strategy applies from both
a mental and a physical standpoint. Introducing
concepts and exercises at a manageable pace will
improve the likelihood that your clients will adhere
to their programs and reach their goals.

confidence.

ORDER OF EXERCISES
Successful corrective exercise programs must
address a client’s imbalances and deviations in a
logical and sequential format. Structures that have
been damaged and stressed must first be allowed to
rest and regenerate before any attempts at retraining
through stretching or strengthening can be made
(Price and Bratcher 2010). Therefore, when designing a corrective exercise program, use activities that
achieve the following goals in the order listed:
1. Let inflamed joints rest while incorporating
techniques for rejuvenating and regenerating
the fascia, muscles, and tendons.
2. Increase blood flow and range of movement.
3. Strengthen the muscles and challenge the
nervous system.
In other words, every corrective exercise program
should begin with self-myofascial release techniques, then progress to stretching, and ultimately
advance to strengthening exercises.
■■Self-myofascial release: The term myofas-

cial comes from “myo” meaning muscle and
“fascial” referring to fascia. This technique of
self-massage is used to restore and rejuvenate
soft tissues that have become adversely affected
by chronic musculoskeletal imbalances (Rolf
1989; Myers 2008; Travell and Simons 1992).
Self-myofascial release also helps clients feel
better by reducing aches and pains that accompany excessive soft tissue stress. Always start
each exercise session and each program with
some form of self-massage that clients can also
do between sessions at home, at the office, or
anywhere they feel completely comfortable.

■■Stretching: As the soft tissue structures

become more fluid and healthy with the regular
performance of self-myofascial release exercises, the next step in the corrective exercise
process is to increase flexibility of the muscles
and fascia and to increase the range of motion
of the joints. Many different types of stretching
exercises can be used to increase safe ranges
of motion and retrain movement in those parts
of the body that have become dysfunctional
because of chronic musculoskeletal imbalances
(Walker 2011).
■■Strengthening: Once a client has begun to
improve the condition of specific soft tissue
structures, add strengthening exercises to
the program. These will fortify the soft tissue
structures and will increase the client’s confidence about movements that were previously
difficult. Strengthening exercises are also
used to reeducate the client’s body so it can
eliminate musculoskeletal imbalances (Price
and Sharpe 2009).
The appropriate application and progression (or
regression, when appropriate) of self-myofascial,
stretching, and strengthening exercises is vital to
the design of corrective exercise programs. Each of
these modalities will be discussed in greater detail
in later chapters.

EVALUATING EXERCISES
Selecting effective corrective exercises involves
determining whether the techniques you recommend are both effective and practical. Clients are
unlikely to adhere to exercises that call for equipment they cannot easily obtain. Therefore, you
should always evaluate both the usefulness and the
practicality of an exercise before choosing it.
The following SIMPLE exercise evaluation process can help you determine the suitability of an
exercise by identifying the target structures, the
imbalances being addressed, the clients’ ability to do
the exercise, practicality, and possible alternatives,
regressions, and progressions.


Elements of Corrective Exercise Programs

■■Structure: What structures (muscles, fascia,

■■Level: Can this exercise be progressed or

joints, bones) are targeted with this exercise?
■■Imbalance: Which musculoskeletal imbalance(s) are you addressing with this exercise?
■■Mechanics: What are the correct mechanics of
the exercise (so the imbalance is addressed and
not exacerbated), and can the client perform it
correctly?
■■Practical: Will the client perform this exercise
effectively and regularly? (Are the constraints of
the exercise reasonable, and are the equipment
needs practical?)

regressed for a greater or lesser challenge to
meet the client’s needs?
■■Exercise alternatives: Is there a similar exercise that targets the same imbalance that is
more likely to increase client adherence—that
is, an exercise the client likes better or that
can more easily be incorporated into his or her
daily routine?
Use this SIMPLE procedure to evaluate every
corrective exercise you recommend to ensure that
you meet each client’s needs.

Review of Key Points
Many factors must be considered when selecting effective corrective exercises.
■■The three most important components of successful corrective exercise selection are:

–– the ability to assess clients’ musculoskeletal imbalances and evaluate the condition
of their soft tissue structures,
–– the ability to recognize client anxieties and build their confidence using appropriate
communication strategies, and
–– knowing which corrective exercises to use for each client and the order in which
they should be introduced.
■■Corrective exercise programs will be most successful if the strategies you first recom-

mend promote healing and regeneration of the affected structures and can also be easily
adhered to.
■■Clients with musculoskeletal imbalances, injuries, or pain will likely feel anxious about

their condition. Look for indications that anxiety levels may be rising as you discuss
exercises and other program variables with them. You can adapt your strategies as needed
to help keep them comfortable, confident, and focused.
■■The best strategies for building client confidence are:

–– Speak in a straightforward manner and avoid using complex, technical terms.
–– Begin a program with exercises you know they can perform successfully.
–– Apply the guiding principle of gradual progression to all aspects of a corrective
exercise program.
■■Every corrective exercise program should incorporate self-myofascial release techniques,

stretches, and strengthening exercises, in that order.
■■Evaluate every corrective exercise using the SIMPLE procedure so that those you choose

are appropriate, effective, and practical.

Self-Check
Due to the anxiety that accompanies chronic musculoskeletal imbalances and pain, it is
important to explain corrective exercise to your clients without using technical jargon. To
help you hone this valuable skill, use the following spaces to explain the concepts and benefits of self-myofascial release, stretching, and strengthening exercises in simple, everyday
language. An example for self-myofascial release has been provided.

Type of exercise

Jargon-free description

Self-myofascial release

Self-myofascial release is just a fancy name for self-massage. Self-massage is used to
bring blood supply to tight muscles and other tissues that have been affected by the imbalances we found during your assessment. These techniques will rejuvenate and regenerate
your body, which will alleviate some of your symptoms and prepare to you progress with
your program when the time comes.
