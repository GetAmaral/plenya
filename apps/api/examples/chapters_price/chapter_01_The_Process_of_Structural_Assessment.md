CHAPTER 1
The Process of Structural
Assessment
A structural assessment is one of the most important tools a fitness professional can use to gather
information about the condition and function of a
client’s musculoskeletal system. The BioMechanics
Method structural assessment process is designed to
collect this information in an organized, sequential,
and logical format. The process involves an initial
verbal consultation followed by visual and handson assessments of a client’s feet and ankles, knees,
lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, thoracic spine, shoulder
girdle, neck, and head. The results of this structural
assessment will provide information about the current state of a client’s musculoskeletal system. It will
also give you insight into the way the client moves
and any dysfunction he or she might exhibit when
engaged in daily activities, exercise, and sports. For
example, if a structural assessment reveals overpronated feet (i.e., flat feet) when standing, then it
is likely that the client’s feet will also overpronate
during more dynamic activities like walking and
running (Bryant and Green 2010).
Before you meet with a client for the structural
assessment, a number of matters should be considered to make sure the process runs smoothly. The
following guidelines will help you to be proficient
and to minimize stress for the client.

INITIAL CONTACT
WITH CLIENT
Contact a client before the in-person assessment
to answer questions about the appointment. This
first exchange, while casual in nature, sets the tone
for your ongoing relationship with the client, so it
must be done well to help establish your professional credibility. Despite the current popularity of
email and texting, you should make this contact via
telephone whenever possible, and you should speak
with the client directly. The client may feel very
anxious about the structural assessment process,
and she will likely have questions about such things
as what to wear, how long the appointment will last,
how much it will cost, and whether she can bring a
family member to the appointment. Making contact
in person will help you to alleviate these initial
anxieties and set up a more encouraging and supportive relationship from the outset (Bryant, Green,
and Newton-Merrill 2013). See chapter 22 for more
information on client relationships.
To prepare clients adequately for the consultation, give them a basic overview of what to expect.
For example, you might say something like, “During

the initial session I will be asking you a series of
questions about your body, and I will perform a
thorough musculoskeletal assessment. This will
help us identify any areas of possible dysfunction
that might affect your ability to exercise effectively
or that might contribute to any aches and pains you
feel. I will also happily answer any questions you
might have about the process as we go.”
Tell clients that the assessment process requires
you to view certain areas of their bodies clearly.
Therefore, it will be necessary for them to wear
assessment-friendly clothing. Advise male clients to
wear (or bring to the appointment to change into)
shorts and a tank top and female clients to wear
shorts and a sports bra or tank top. Also be sure to
let clients know they will need to remove their socks
and shoes for the assessment.
If clients indicate that they are not comfortable
wearing the clothing just described, or if you hear
in her voice that she is anxious about wearing such
attire, simply find an acceptable alternative that
will meet both your needs. A form-fitting T-shirt
may suffice for upper body assessments, and running leggings or yoga pants may be worn instead of
shorts. Never insist that clients wear clothing that
makes them feel uncomfortable.
If a client has never been to your facility, gym, or
place of business before, give him accurate directions to the building or meeting area, information
about parking, and any other useful information
about your premises. Follow up your conversation
with an email detailing this information so he can
refer to it on the day of the appointment.
Scheduling an initial consultation can be a
stressful experience for a client. Do not overwhelm
prospective clients with too much information when
you first speak on the telephone or in your follow-up
email. Keep your instructions concise, clear, and
simple. You can elaborate on additional matters when
you meet in person (Price 2012).

STRUCTURAL
ASSESSMENT PROCESS
The structural assessment process includes the following three elements:
1. A verbal assessment
2. A visual assessment
3. A hands-on assessment
Each part of this process is designed to gather
significant information about the client. Complete

each element of the process in turn, and do not omit
any part.

where Justin talks about The BioMechanics
Method structural assessment process and
the importance of the Client Assessment
Diagram.

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
The verbal assessment is the first part of the structural assessment process. It is used to acquire health
history information about a client’s musculoskeletal
well-being. The verbal assessment begins informally
during the initial contact with the client on the telephone. It continues in a structured format when you
meet the client in person for the first visit. The verbal
assessment contains questions about musculoskeletal discomfort, past injuries and surgeries, types
and intensity of physical activity, occupation, and
information the client may have about diagnosed
medical conditions that might be affecting her musculoskeletal system. The responses will help you to
evaluate her current level of function. It will also
provide valuable insight about how the client feels
both physically and mentally about her musculoskeletal health. Moreover, the verbal assessment helps
you and the client to develop trust and rapport as
you progress into the visual and hands-on parts of
the assessment process (Price and Bratcher 2010).
The Client Assessment Diagram (CAD) (which
will be discussed in detail later in this chapter and
is available in the appendix) will guide you through
the questions that must be asked during the verbal
assessment. There is a space on the CAD for the client’s response to each question. You can mark an X
on the CAD to indicate areas of the body where the
client has experienced pain or dysfunction either
now or in the past.
Conduct the verbal assessment in its entirety
at the beginning of the appointment so the client
can answer all your questions while seated and
comfortable. Do not ask clients to fill out the CAD
themselves. It is vital that you ask all of the questions
and record the information on the CAD yourself.
Taking the time to ask each question enables you
to encourage feedback, observe body language,
and foster an atmosphere of teamwork and communication (Whitworth et al. 2007). Occasionally,
clients may be nervous about forgetting something
during the verbal assessment. Assure them that
you will make a note of any additional information


The Process of Structural Assessment

they remember as you are conducting the visual and
hands-on assessment.

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENT
The visual and hands-on assessment portion of the
structural assessment process involves visually
and manually inspecting each major area of the
client’s body (Kendall, McCreary, and Provance
2005). These two components of the assessment
process are distinct, but they should be carried out
simultaneously to make the process more practical
and less time consuming. As an inquisitive fitness
professional, you may take a keen interest in gathering information about a client’s musculoskeletal
imbalances, but a nervous client standing before you
in tight clothes may not share your level of interest.
Therefore, conduct the visual and hands-on assessment quickly and efficiently while also making sure
that the client understands each stage of the process.
As the name implies, hands-on assessments will
require physical contact between you and the client.
Always ask permission before touching a client in
any way, and explain what you are going to do before
doing it. You should also ask clients to tell you if they
feel uncomfortable, do not wish to be touched, or do
not wish to continue with an assessment.
You will begin the visual and hands-on assessment at the feet and ankles. This is not because the
feet and ankles are more relevant than other parts of
the body, but because beginning the assessment here
is less intimidating for your client. Once you have
completed your assessments for the feet and ankles,
you will work your way up the body, performing your
assessments on the knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle,
thoracic spine, shoulder girdle, neck, and head. This
foot-to-head approach will allow the client to relax
as the process unfolds, enabling him to feel more at
ease as you assess each subsequent area of his body
(Price and Bratcher 2010).
Go to the online video to watch video 1.2,
where Justin explains why the assessment
process starts at the feet.

As you conduct the visual and hands-on assessment, you should explain the process and share your
findings so the client understands what is happening
at each stage. As you assess each body part, record
your findings in the appropriate space on the CAD.
If a client expresses pain or discomfort at any time
during an assessment, stop the assessment imme-

diately and, where appropriate, continue to the next
assessment.
As you become more proficient and practiced in
performing structural assessments, it will become
easier to demonstrate each procedure and to explain
the results in simple terms to the client. Your ability
to conduct the assessments in an interesting manner
will also help to strengthen clients’ interest in the
process. Then they will begin to appreciate how
their own musculoskeletal imbalances are negatively
affecting the function of their bodies.
Effective communication during the assessment
process can also help with a client’s subsequent
adherence to a corrective exercise program (Price
2016). Take, for example, a client seeking help to
alleviate discomfort in her knees when she exercises. During the structural assessment, you note
imbalances in her feet and ankles that could be
influencing the discomfort in her knees. As a result,
you recommend a series of corrective exercises for
the feet and ankles. If you fail to effectively explain
during the structural assessment how the foot and
ankle imbalances can affect her knees, she may not
see the value in doing the exercises. In fact, she may
even become annoyed that you are providing the
“wrong” exercises since they are for her feet/ankles
and not for her painful knees. On the other hand, if
you have successfully explained how the imbalances
in her feet and ankles can cause her knee pain, she
will be more likely to perform the exercises you
recommend.
As you evaluate each body part, think about the
body as a whole, and try to determine how other
structures may be affecting the area you are currently assessing. For example, if you discover a
client has an imbalance in his feet and ankles, then
consider whether other imbalances elsewhere in his
body may be contributing to his foot and ankle problem. The remaining chapters in part I of this text
describe in detail how each body area is affected by
the other parts. It is critical to understand that each
structure in the human body functions as a link in
an interconnected chain.

CLIENT ASSESSMENT
DIAGRAM
As you progress through the structural assessment
process, record all the information you gather
about the client. The easiest way to do this is to use
the Client Assessment Diagram (CAD), which has
been designed for this purpose. The CAD lists all
the questions that should be asked and the assessments that should be conducted. It also has space

for you to mark when an item has been completed,
and it includes areas to record the verbal, visual,
and hands-on results for each area of the body.
An anatomical figure is provided for you to mark
those areas of pain and dysfunction reported by
the client during the verbal assessment. Making

quick reference marks with an X on this figure will
allow you to remain focused on what the client
is saying and on nonverbal clues the client may
reveal as you conduct the assessment. A blank
copy of the Client Assessment Diagram can be
found in the appendix.

Review of Key Points
The structural assessment process enables fitness professionals to gather pertinent information about a client’s musculoskeletal condition in an organized, sequential, and logical format.
■■The assessment process consists of three distinct parts:

1. Verbal assessment
2. Visual assessment
3. Hands-on assessment
■■The verbal assessment begins with your initial contact on the telephone and continues

in a structured format during your first meeting with a client.
■■The visual and hands-on assessments are distinct assessments; however, they should be

conducted simultaneously to make the process more practical and efficient.
■■The visual and hands-on assessment begins with the feet and ankles and moves up the

body to the knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, thoracic spine, and shoulder girdle, and it
ends at the neck and head.
■■The structural assessment process includes protocols that make the experience less

stressful for client and assessor alike:
–– Providing information on what to expect during the appointment
–– Providing clear directions to the facility or meeting spot
–– Providing information about what to wear for the assessment
–– Answering any additional questions the client may have about the appointment
■■All of the questions and assessments used during the structural assessment process

are listed on the Client Assessment Diagram. Spaces are also provided on this form to
record your assessment results.

Self-Check
There are a number of obstacles that can make conducting a structural assessment more
confusing or stressful than necessary for both you and your client. Consider the following
potential problems one might encounter before, during, or after an assessment. Indicate in
the space next to each issue who (you, your client, or both) would be affected by each difficulty and what you could do to rectify the problem.
