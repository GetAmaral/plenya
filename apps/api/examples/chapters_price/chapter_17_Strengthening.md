# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 17: Strengthening

CHAPTER 17
Strengthening
In this chapter you will learn how to progress from
stretching exercises to introducing various techniques for strengthening muscles and other soft
tissue structures that have been adversely affected
by musculoskeletal imbalances. You will learn about
several different types of strengthening exercises
and how they can be used to recondition, retrain, and
develop those parts of the body needed to address
the underlying causes of a client’s musculoskeletal
imbalances. You will also learn teaching and cueing
tips to help you communicate these strategies to
clients as well as procedures for progressing and
regressing these techniques.

WHAT IS
STRENGTHENING?
Musculoskeletal imbalances have a dramatic effect on
both the skeleton and the soft tissue structures. They
cause myofascial restrictions that affect joint range
of motion or function. Muscle length and tension are
also affected, thus influencing the muscles’ ability to
contract, lengthen, and relax appropriately. As various muscles and other soft tissue structures lose their
ability to function correctly, other musculoskeletal
structures in the body take over for these dysfunctional areas, leading to further compensations and
additional imbalances (Fritz 2013; Houglum 2016).
The appropriate and progressive application of
self-myofascial release techniques and stretching
exercises into a client’s program helps to restore
muscle function and range of motion. Once the soft
tissue structures are reasonably healthy and pliable
again, you can begin to introduce loads and resistance through the use of strengthening exercises

(Clark and Lucett 2011). Strengthening is the process of activating, coordinating, and continuing to
reinforce correct motor and movement patterns by
challenging the musculoskeletal and neuromuscular
systems under load or tension (Clark and Lucett
2011; Price and Bratcher 2010). Strengthening exercises facilitate changes to these systems, resulting
in physiological adaptations such as improvements
in neural firing and increases in muscle size, endurance, power, and strength (Clark and Lucett 2011).
When performed correctly and consistently,
resistance exercises help strengthen muscles to
support the correct alignment and movement of the
skeleton and to improve neuromuscular coordination. The successful performance of these exercises
also increases clients’ confidence in their ability to
move a previously injured, painful, or dysfunctional
body part. Strengthening exercises that address
and correct musculoskeletal imbalances rather than
exacerbate them will reduce unnecessary stress to
other parts of the body. This allows overworked or
inflamed areas to rest, recover, and recuperate. The
introduction and regular use of corrective strengthening exercises is vital for helping clients to reach
both their short- and long-term health and fitness
goals (Price and Bratcher 2010).

ORIGINS OF
STRENGTHENING
EXERCISES
Resistance training programs have been used for
over 3,500 years in different parts of the world to
better prepare people for a task, such as sports or

battle (Kraemer and Häkkinen 2002). The ancient
Greeks, in particular, regularly integrated structured weight training into their daily routines to
develop healthy, strong, and muscular physiques
(Price 2008).
However, the development of precise and specialized exercise modalities to help people recover from
injuries and to address musculoskeletal imbalances
did not begin to develop until after the Industrial
Revolution in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Kraemer and Häkkinen 2002; Price 2008).
After World War I, the modern practice of physical
therapy was introduced to the medical community
as a means of restoring movement and function to
injured soldiers, primarily through the application
of strengthening exercises (Price 2008).
Since that time, physical therapy has been used to
treat incapacitated patients recovering from injuries.
However, over the past several decades there has
been an epidemic rise in the number of people suffering from common musculoskeletal imbalances that
are not caused by an injury. These imbalances are
caused by environmental factors, such as prolonged
static postures, footwear choices, and sedentary
lifestyles (Price and Bratcher 2010). Many people
with common musculoskeletal imbalances do not
need physical therapy, and so the field of corrective
exercise is evolving to fill the gap in care for this
population. As a result, the use of musculoskeletal
assessments, self-myofascial release, restorative
stretching, and corrective strengthening exercises
in fitness settings is fast becoming commonplace.

BENEFITS OF
STRENGTHENING
EXERCISES
There are many documented benefits of strengthening exercises for corrective exercise clients. Specific benefits of corrective strengthening exercises
include the following (Clark and Lucett 2011; McGill
2002; Miller 1995; Stone, Stone, and Sands 2007):
■■Increases in muscular strength
■■Increases in muscular endurance
■■Promotion of growth and strength of connective

tissue
■■Improved joint stability
■■Improved joint mobility
■■Promotion of growth in joint cartilage

■■Increased bone mineral density
■■Increased muscular coordination
■■Improved motor skill activity
■■Improved motor unit and neuromuscular acti-

vation

TYPES OF
STRENGTHENING
EXERCISES
Six kinds of strengthening exercises are highlighted
in this chapter:
1. Isometric
2. Concentric
3. Eccentric
4. Single joint
5. Multijoint and kinetic chain
6. Multiplanar and multidimensional coordinated
movements
Each type of strengthening exercise offers a
unique benefit to clients as they progress through
their corrective exercise programs or exercise sessions.

ISOMETRIC
An isometric contraction occurs when a muscle
becomes activated by neural input (i.e., movement
information through nerves from the brain) but
stays the same length during the contraction—that
is, it neither shortens nor lengthens (Higgins 2011).
This is the easiest type of movement for the nervous
system to coordinate. Once the nervous system
has generated an isometric muscle contraction,
it can usually continue sending a strong signal to
the muscles involved to maintain a state of activation. An example of an isometric exercise would be
holding the Straight Arm Raise (see figure 17.1) in
a static contracted state for an allocated amount
of time.
When a muscle cannot activate correctly, or when
it has disrupted neural input as a result of chronic
musculoskeletal issues, it is important to get that
muscle working again before progressing to more
challenging types of strengthening exercises. You
should never assume that a muscle that is not working correctly in isolation will work as part of a more
complex multijoint or kinetic chain motion.


Strengthening

CONCENTRIC AND
ECCENTRIC
A concentric muscle action involves shortening a
muscle to bring the origin and insertion points of that
muscle closer together, and it results in the movement of bones at a joint (see figure 17.2) (Fishman,
Ballantyne, and Rathmell 2009). Concentric muscle
contractions are usually easy for clients to see and
feel because the muscle they are contracting will
usually appear (or feel to the touch) larger as it contracts and shortens. An eccentric muscle action, on
the other hand, involves the lengthening of a muscle
and serves to slow down parts of the body as they
move (Fishman, Ballantyne, and Rathmell 2009). For
example, lowering a heavy weight from shoulder to
waist height involves an eccentric muscle action of
the biceps to counterbalance the weight of the dumbbell and the force of gravity as the elbow straightens.
Concentric strengthening exercises can involve
a single joint (see Single Joint section that follows)
or multiple joints (see Multijoint section later in this
chapter). Concentric strengthening exercises are generally safer for clients to perform than eccentric exercises because a concentric action typically initiates

movement at a joint. An eccentric action, on the other
hand, involves slowing down forces on a joint. Clients
who cannot perform an eccentric movement correctly
may experience more stress on a joint or pain if they
cannot perform it correctly. Therefore, strengthening
exercises that involve concentric muscle actions are
usually better initial choices to start the strengthening
phase of a corrective exercise program. Bearing this
in mind, always look to progress clients safely into
incorporating eccentric movements that train their
musculoskeletal system how to slow down movement
and minimize stress to their body.

SINGLE JOINT
Single-joint strengthening exercises strengthen
the muscles that move one joint at a time (Ackland,
Elliott, and Bloomfield 2009). There is usually less
risk for injury when you introduce single-joint
strengthening exercises into a client’s corrective
exercise program because movement is controlled
and is restricted to only one bony juncture. However,
single-joint strengthening exercises should only be
used once you are confident that a client is proficient
at activating and controlling the muscle or group of
muscles that must move the target joint. For example,

a client must be able to activate her quadriceps muscles concentrically in order to extend the knee and
eccentrically to slow down knee flexion. Isometric
strengthening exercises (see Isometric section earlier
in this chapter) can be used to evaluate the quality
or strength of contraction for a muscle or group of
muscles before you introduce either concentric or
eccentric single-joint strengthening exercises.
If you recommend an exercise to a client and later
find that a muscle or muscle group is not activating
correctly, you may need to increase or decrease the
input to those muscles by providing concentric or
eccentric loading to stimulate the muscle to respond.
For example, if you notice a client’s abductors (e.g.,
gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) are not contracting—or she does not feel them contracting—
when she performs a single-joint exercise like the
Side Lying Leg Lift, you can help to activate those
muscles by using your hand to place a gentle load on
the movement. (Pushing down on the knee as she
lowers the leg emphasizes the eccentric phase.) See
figure 17.3. This extra pressure will help increase the
neuromuscular demand on the muscles, stimulating
them to activate in response (Reider, Provencher,
and Davies 2015).
Adding a load in a controlled manner is a safe
way to manipulate this particular exercise because
the client is at little risk for injury when she moves
a single joint while lying on the ground. However,
when adding a load to any exercise, do not apply
more pressure than a client can reasonably control.
Otherwise, she will have to recruit other parts of her

body to help with the movement if the force is too
great (that is, she will have to “cheat”).
Single-joint strengthening exercises are also
recommended at the outset of a client strengthening
program because they do not overload the nervous
system with too much information, and they can be
coordinated easily (Ackland, Elliott, and Bloomfield 2009). Clients can rapidly become proficient
at single-joint strengthening exercises, thereby
increasing their confidence in moving a previously
painful or injured part.

Figure 17.3 Example of a single-joint exercise
with external load.

Figure 17.4 Example of a multijoint exercise.

MULTIJOINT
Multijoint strengthening exercises involve the
movement of more than one joint (Ackland, Elliott,
and Bloomfield 2009). Multijoint movements are
designed to target one muscle that moves multiple
joints, but they usually also involve the strengthening and integration of ancillary muscles that
affect the joints being targeted. For example, the
Gluteal Activation Over Ball exercise (see figure
17.4) is a multijoint exercise specifically designed
to strengthen the gluteus maximus muscle.
However, it also strengthens the hamstrings and
quadriceps muscles isometrically because they
are involved in stabilizing the knee and keeping
the leg straight during this exercise. Multijoint
exercises should be added to a client’s program
only when you are confident that the client has
gained control over the muscle or muscle group
involved in the movement.


Strengthening

KINETIC CHAIN
Kinetic chain exercises are comprised of a sequential series of motions or actions that rely on each
other to produce a desired movement. This type of
exercise is designed to teach a client how to use a
number of muscles (or muscle groups) to create a
chain of motion involving several areas of the body.
Kinetic chain exercises are only appropriate for use
when a client can control the muscles involved in
the sequence both concentrically and eccentrically,
and all of the joints those muscles cross. Kinetic
chain movements can be open (i.e., the end of the
“chain”—the hands or feet—can move freely) or
closed (the end of the “chain”—the hands or feet—is
restrained or fixed) (Ellenbecker and Davies 2001).
For example, the Wave Goodbye (see figure 17.5a)
is an open kinetic chain exercise because it involves
coordination of the muscles that depress the scapula
and bend the elbows while the rotator cuff muscles
externally rotate the arms, which are not fixed (or
closed) in any way.
On the other hand, The Pivot exercise (see figure
17.5b) is designed to strengthen many muscles that
cross all of the joints in the lower body. However,
one end of the chain (the foot) is in contact with the
ground during the exercise. Therefore, this is considered a closed kinetic chain strengthening exercise.
Closed kinetic chain strengthening exercises

a

Figure 17.5

typically require more neuromuscular coordination than open kinetic chain movements due to the
increased demand of forces being exerted at the ends
of the chain. Consequently, closed-chain exercises
are potentially more stressful to the muscles and
joints being targeted because any imbalances or
restrictions can cause compensatory movements
elsewhere (Ellenbecker and Davies 2001). Therefore,
open-chain exercises should be introduced first
when using kinetic chain exercises to reduce the
likelihood of injury as you teach clients to coordinate multiple joints and multiple muscles working
together as an integrated unit.

MULTIPLANAR AND
MULTIDIMENSIONAL
COORDINATED MOVEMENTS
Multiplanar exercises are those that move the body
up and down, and in different directions, such as
forward and backward, side-to-side, and in rotation (see figure 17.6). When groups of muscles
work efficiently as part of a kinetic chain, you can
progress to using whole-body, dynamic exercises
that incorporate multiple planes and dimensions
to ensure coordinated function of the entire body
(Houglum 2016). Multidimensional exercises
apply more scope to kinetic chain and multiplanar

exercises by moving the body against resistance or
on an unstable surface like a BOSU Balance Trainer,
for example (see figure 17.7) (Shumway-Cook and
Woollocott 2007).
Multidimensional and multiplanar exercises are
designed to mimic real-life activities. They can be
used to prepare a client for the performance of activities such as running or engaging in sports. Before
introducing multiplanar and multidimensional
strengthening exercises to a client’s corrective exer-

cise program, however, you must evaluate whether
she can correctly perform all of the movements
required to execute the multifaceted movement you
are proposing. Once you are confident she has the
necessary skills, progress to using a multidimensional and multiplanar exercise that fosters improvement in those movements she needs to perform her
chosen activity or sport. For example, if a client is an
avid, right-handed tennis player, you can progress
the Lunge With Knee Pull exercise (see figure 17.8)


Strengthening

more proficient in the long run. As they attempt
an exercise, clients will begin to learn how to
coordinate previously dysfunctional or injured
parts, and their brains and neuromuscular systems will become stronger as they learn to correct mistakes and make improvements (Coyle
2009). It is very important, however, to watch
them closely and offer detailed feedback when
they try any type of new exercise in order to
minimize mistakes that could result in pain or
injury or exacerbate existing problems.

when she is ready by coaching her to hold a medicine
ball or tennis racket as she lunges forward onto her
left leg. This will mimic setting up to hit a backhand
in tennis.
You can progress any multiplanar and multidimensional kinetic chain exercise by adding external
load, a variety of arm and leg movements, torso rotations, or multidirectional upper body movements to
mimic real-life movements. The correct and efficient performance of these types of exercises is the
ultimate goal for your corrective exercise program
clients. When they have reached this level, they
should be free from pain, highly functional, and
able to perform coordinated, dynamic movements.

TEACHING TIPS FOR
STRENGTHENING
EXERCISES
There are a number of cueing, conditioning, and
communication techniques to help you to implement
strengthening exercises in clients’ programs:
1. Clients will rarely perform strengthening
exercises perfectly on their first try. Allowing
clients to make mistakes as they try new movements and exercises gives them a wonderful
learning opportunity that will help them to be

2. Strengthening exercises that are used to
retrain the neuromuscular system use different
variables than strengthening exercises that are
used only to build muscle mass (Hoffman 2014).
While general guidelines are provided in chapter 21, the variables of any corrective strengthening exercise—such as number of sets, repetitions, and frequency—should be tailored for
clients’ individual needs and abilities. When
you establish these variables, bear in mind that
the correct execution of the exercise is more
important than achieving a specific number
of sets or reps (Price and Bratcher 2010). As a
client’s abilities improve, the variables for each
exercise should be adjusted accordingly.
3. As your teaching relationship with your clients
builds, try to familiarize yourself with their
learning styles. For example, you might find
that one client learns more effectively by watching you demonstrate an exercise first, while
another may need you to explain the exercise
in words so he can process the information
before attempting the movement. Yet another
client may want to try to perform the exercise
right away to get a feeling for what it is like. As
you come to understand the learning styles of
individual clients, you can teach subsequent
exercises much more easily by using cues that
match the way they learn (Wrisberg 2007).
More information on learning styles can be
found in chapter 23.
4. As clients progress into the strengthening
phase of their corrective exercise programs, you
can strengthen their motivation by reminding
them of movements they are now doing that
used to be difficult or impossible (Wrisberg
2007). For example, a client might have initially
come to see you because she could not raise her
arms very high without experiencing shoulder
pain. However, as she performs strengthening
exercises such as the Straight Arm Raise, you
can remind her that she can now lift her arms

169


170

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

without pain. This will not only show her how
far she has progressed, but it will also give her
a reason to continue to perform these exercises
at home.
5. As clients are introduced to various strengthening exercises, it is also important to link the
reason why they are performing a particular
exercise to the initial musculoskeletal imbalances you identified during the assessment
process (Price and Bratcher 2010). For example,
if you are at the stage of a program where you are
teaching a client how to do a Pelvic Tilt, remind
him that his assessment results revealed that he
had an anterior pelvic tilt and that this exercise
will help address this imbalance (with the goal
of alleviating his back pain). Call attention to the
fact that the muscles of his lumbar spine are now
flexible enough to allow his lower back to round,
permitting him to perform the Pelvic Tilt exercise correctly. This indicates that his lumbopelvic hip girdle is becoming more mobile and
is releasing its “grip” on the structures of his
lower back. Describing exercise selection in
this way can help your clients to become more
mindful of their habitual movement patterns
and postures and give them a reason to adhere
to their corrective exercise programs.
6. It is also helpful to link specific strengthening
exercises you are recommending to those selfmyofascial release and stretching exercises that
helped prepare the client for such a progression.
For example, if a client has progressed to the

Butt Lift strengthening exercise (see chapter
21), point out how he can do this exercise
correctly now because he first rejuvenated
and regenerated the gluteal muscles with the
Foam Roller Gluteal Complex exercise and then
stretched the area with the Glute Stretch and
Lower Back Stretch. Consequently, his lower
back has released, and the glutes are now working effectively to lift the hips as they perform
this strengthening exercise. This teaching
technique not only helps your clients to see how
they have progressed, but it also provides solutions (i.e., suitable regressions) for them if they
are having trouble performing a strengthening
exercise on their own.

WHEN TO REGRESS
STRENGTHENING EXERCISES
It is important that clients be able to successfully perform the strengthening exercises you recommend,
both under your supervision and when doing them on
their own. Therefore, you will need to know when it
is appropriate to regress any strengthening exercise.
1. If you are teaching an exercise and the client
experiences pain of any kind, regress that exercise to one that she can perform without pain
(Price and Bratcher 2010). For example, if you
are trying to teach your client The Pivot exercise and she has knee pain, regress to an appropriate exercise such as the Duck Stand to help
activate the gluteal muscles (see figure 17.9) or

Figure 17.9 Regression of a strengthening exercise.


Strengthening

WAYS TO REGRESS
STRENGTHENING EXERCISES

a self-myofascial release exercise, if necessary,
such as Foam Roller on the Gluteal Complex or
Foam Roller IT Band (see chapter 20) to loosen
the structures that affect the knee first.
2. Regress a strengthening exercise if a client has
difficulty performing or coordinating the movement correctly. You must watch your clients’
body language when they perform any kind
of strengthening exercise. If their breathing
rate increases unnecessarily, or they bite their
lips, stick out their tongue over their top lip,
look uncomfortable, or exhibit other nonverbal
signals of anxiety and discomfort, it could mean
that they are overloaded with too much information. If you see indications of neuromuscular
overload and confusion, it is wiser to regress
than to have a client persist with the exercise
(Chaitow and Delany 2005).
3. Regress a strengthening exercise if a client
reports excessive soreness the next day or later
the same day. Corrective exercises are designed
to slowly retrain the way the body moves by
gradually retraining the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems (Bryant and Green 2010).
They are not designed to overtax the muscles,
nervous system, joints, or connective tissues. If
there is excessive muscle soreness or joint pain
in one area after an exercise session, it can create
additional musculoskeletal imbalances as they
try to avoid the soreness in subsequent sessions.

There are many other possibilities for regressing
strengthening exercises. Additional ideas and suggestions for regressions can be found in chapter 21,
Strengthening Exercises.

Figure 17.10 Adding a balance aid is a way to
regress an exercise.

Figure 17.11 Lying down is a way to regress an
exercise.

There are many ways you can regress a strengthening exercise:
1. If clients have trouble maintaining balance
when performing an exercise, have them use a
balance aid (McGill 2002). For example, clients
can tap their other foot on the ground for balance when performing The Pivot exercise (see
figure 17.10), or they can perform the exercise
beside a wall or chair in case they need something to grab onto during the exercise to feel
more secure.
2. You can regress a strengthening exercise by
having the client perform the exercise lying
down (McGill 2002). The Straight Arm Raise
(see figure 17.11) is an exercise that can be very
easily regressed in this manner.
3. A strengthening exercise can also be regressed
by revisiting or repeating a self-myofascial exercise or stretch that will help the client return
to the strengthening exercise more adequately
prepared (Price and Bratcher 2010).

WHEN TO PROGRESS
STRENGTHENING EXERCISES
Clients will enjoy progressing through the various
stages of their strengthening programs as they
improve their functional capabilities and experience
less pain as they move. It is important to advance
each exercise as soon as they become proficient with
that movement or phase of the program.
1. Progress a strengthening exercise when a client
has achieved a suitable level of competency
and can perform the movement satisfactorily.
If you find that clients can successfully do the
desired number of repetitions with the correct
technique, progress the exercise to keep challenging their musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems.
2. Progress a strengthening exercise if a client has
reached an acceptable level of proficiency and
indicates that her program is taking too much
time. For example, if when you are reviewing
homework with a client, you learn that she
regularly cannot complete the exercises because
they take too long, progress her program (Price
and Bratcher 2010). If the client has demonstrated proficiency at both the Gluteal Activation
Over Ball exercise (which targets the gluteus
maximus) and the Side Lying Leg Lift exercise
(which targets the gluteus medius and minimus),
replace both exercises with The Pivot (see chapter 21), which targets these muscles simultaneously as part of one kinetic chain movement.

3. As clients advance with their programs, they
often quickly achieve many of their initial pain
reduction goals (e.g., standing, sitting, and
walking without pain). As a result, they will
begin to feel more confident in their physical
abilities and may indicate that they would also
like to be able to play golf or tennis or engage
in some other sport. If a client is physically and
mentally ready to prepare to participate in an
activity, progress his strengthening exercises so
they start mimicking the movements required
for the desired activity (Shumway-Cook and
Woollocott 2007). For example, if a client says
that she wants to resume playing tennis, you
could combine Side Lunge With Rotation (see
figure 17.12a) and the movement of the right
arm in The Flasher exercise (see figure 17.12b)
to create a full-body kinetic chain exercise that
mimics the action of preparing to hit a forehand
volley (assuming the client is right-handed)
(see figure 17.12c).

WAYS TO PROGRESS
STRENGTHENING EXERCISES
There are many ways you can progress a strengthening exercise:
1. You can progress any strengthening exercise
by moving from one type of exercise to a more
challenging movement. For example, progressions can be made from an isometric single-joint
exercise to a concentric or eccentric multi-

c

Strengthening

joint movement. Similarly, you can progress
a strengthening exercise from a multijoint
exercise to a kinetic chain or multiplanar and
multidimensional exercise.
2. A strengthening exercise can be progressed
by adding external load to the exercise (Clark
and Lucett 2011). An example of this would be
coaching a client to hold light weights when
performing Back Step With Arm Raise (see
figure 17.13) so that the muscles of the lumbopelvic hip girdle, trunk, and shoulder girdle
all have to work harder to both accelerate and
decelerate the extra weight.
3. Using fewer props, supports, or tactile feedback is another effective way to progress any
strengthening exercise (Starkey and Johnson
2006). For example, once a client can maintain
the correct spine position for the Straight Arm
Raise against the wall, tell her to step away
from the wall and perform the exercise (see
figure 17.14). Without the wall to help guide
her posture and movement, it will be necessary
for her to tune into her body more to do the
exercise correctly.
4. The ultimate goal of a strengthening exercise is
to perform the movement at the speed at which
it would happen in real life (Price and Sharpe

Figure 17.13 Progress a strengthening exercise by adding external load.

2009). Therefore, as clients improve their technique in executing a particular exercise, have
them perform the movement more rapidly. For
example, the Back Step With Arm Raise is similar to the manner in which a person might reach
up to catch a ball. Having the client gradually
progress the exercise, until they can perform
the movement correctly at the same speed it
would occur in real life, ensures that their neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems learn
to coordinate the right muscles and movements
at speeds that mimic real-life activities.
There are many different possibilities for progressing strengthening exercises. Additional ideas and
suggestions for regressions can be found in chapter
21, Strengthening Exercises.

WHEN NOT TO USE
STRENGTHENING
EXERCISES
When introduced gradually and monitored carefully,
strengthening exercises are a safe and effective
means for progressing a client’s program. However,
following are some specific contraindications for

Figure 17.14 Progressing a strengthening
exercise by removing tactile
feedback, such as a wall.

strengthening exercises in a corrective exercise
setting (Clark and Lucett 2011; Houglum 2016; Price
and Bratcher 2010; Price and Sharpe 2009).
■■Have clients stop a strengthening exercise if

they complain of pain or discomfort.
■■Do not try strengthening exercises for muscles

that surround or cross a fracture site that is
still healing.
■■Do not try strengthening exercises with special
populations such as clients with coronary heart
disease, hypertension, or rheumatoid arthritis
before clearance has been obtained from a
licensed medical professional.
■■Do not use strengthening exercises around
joints that have sustained trauma (e.g., a dislocated shoulder or labral tear).
■■Do not use strengthening exercises that involve
muscles or soft tissues that have recently sustained an acute injury like a tear or have visible
bruising.
■■Do not use strengthening exercises that involve
joints that are acutely inflamed.
■■Use strengthening exercises cautiously and conservatively in those clients with osteoporosis.
■■Obtain clearance from a physician before introducing strengthening exercises to a client’s program immediately after an injury or surgery or
after clients have been diagnosed with a chronic
musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disease.

ADDITIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS
Here are a few more safety and conditioning tips
to be aware of as you incorporate strengthening
exercises into clients’ corrective exercise programs:
1. Corrective strengthening exercises are not just
designed to build up muscles. Many of these
techniques are also designed to retrain the
way the body coordinates movement of the
neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems.
This reeducation process requires patience and
persistence. Allow clients enough time between
their sessions with you to enable them to ade-

quately practice and hopefully improve their
performance with each exercise. Scheduling
strengthening sessions far enough apart will
help ensure that clients are ready to progress to
the next stage of their programs in subsequent
appointments (Price and Bratcher 2010).
2. Do not overestimate either the number of repetitions or the number of sets you recommend.
As clients tire during a session, their technique
will deteriorate. If you see this happening,
discourage them from performing additional
repetitions or sets. It is always better to coach
clients to do one less repetition or set than to
do one extra and risk harm or injury (Bryant
and Green 2010).
3. As you advance the strengthening elements
of clients’ programs, you should progress to
incorporating the use of primarily closed
kinetic chain movements that place particular
focus on the eccentric portion of the movement (especially with exercises designed to
strengthen the structures of the lumbo-pelvic
hip girdle, knees, feet, and ankles). The ability to decelerate the body as it moves is an
essential aspect of corrective exercise training
to help strengthen the body to resist gravity
and impact and reduce the likelihood of injury
(Magee, Zachazewski, and Quillen 2007). However, since eccentric movements can tire the
body easily and can potentially put clients at
risk of injury, be conservative with the volume
of eccentric work you recommend for clients’
programs.
4. If a client has continued difficulty in performing a strengthening exercise or movement, it
may be because that person’s brain or nervous
system is simply not ready to let go of an old
movement pattern. In these cases, you must
regress to either a self-myofascial release or a
stretching exercise to help prepare the body to
accept the new movement (Price and Bratcher
2010).
More information on strengthening techniques,

strengthening component of clients’ programs, can

Strengthening

Review of Key Points
Strengthening exercises are the ultimate progression for corrective exercise programming.
They strengthen muscles and other soft tissues, retrain the nervous system, and teach the
body how to coordinate dynamic, integrated movements to address the underlying causes
of musculoskeletal imbalances.
■■Six types of strengthening exercises are described in this chapter: (1) isometric, (2)

concentric, (3) eccentric, (4) single joint, (5) multijoint and kinetic chain, and (6) multiplanar and multidimensional coordinated movements.
■■There are many documented benefits of incorporating strengthening exercises into cor-

rective exercise programs. However, it is important to progress carefully through the
various types, introducing only those techniques that clients can successfully execute
without compromising form or technique or causing discomfort.
■■As you introduce strengthening exercises to a client’s corrective exercise program, do

not recommend techniques that require a lot of equipment or are not practical for the
client to perform at home or while traveling because this can hamper program adherence.
■■It is vital to know how and when to progress or regress the strengthening portion of

a corrective exercise program. Incorporating or eliminating additional body parts,
introducing or taking away unstable services, getting rid of or adding balance aids, and
subtracting or adding weight are ways to control the level of effort (and subsequent
success) the client experiences.

Self-Check
Take a few minutes to consider the unique aspects of each type of strengthening exercise
you learned about in this chapter. In the lists that follow, you will find the strengthening
exercise types listed on the left side of the page. Draw a line from each exercise type to the
appropriate sample strengthening exercise (taken from chapter 21) that matches it on the
right. There is one exercise match per exercise type.
