# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 20: Stretching Exercises

CHAPTER 20
Stretching Exercises
Stretching exercises are introduced into a corrective
exercise program after the consistent application of
self-myofascial release techniques (Clark and Lucett
2011; Price 2013; Price and Bratcher 2010). Once
the overall condition of dysfunctional soft tissue
structures has been addressed with self-myofascial
release techniques, stretching exercises are used
to introduce movement in order to increase range
of motion in those areas that have been adversely
affected by a client’s musculoskeletal imbalances
(Kovacs 2015; Price and Bratcher 2010).
Muscle tension, guarding, and movement restrictions are common in people with chronic musculoskeletal imbalances. While stretching exercises are
designed to overcome these dysfunctional patterns,
it is also important to remember that sensations of
pain, joint inflammation, and current injuries can
affect the success of any stretching program. In
some cases, stretching can actually do more harm
than good. Therefore, it is important to introduce
isolated and gentle stretching exercises gradually.
You must continually monitor your clients’ sensations
and body language, and you should progress to more
advanced stretching exercises only when they are
ready (Price and Bratcher 2010).

STRETCHING EXERCISE
QUICK TIPS
There are a number of tips and cueing tactics that
can facilitate the process of introducing clients to
stretching techniques. Following is a brief recap of
strategies for progressing your clients to the stretching portion of their corrective exercise programs.
■■Use your knowledge of muscles and movement

to teach clients to perform a stretch correctly,
telling them where they should feel the stretch
and how to adjust their technique if needed.
■■Explain to the client why she is performing a
specific stretch, and link the benefits of that
exercise to the musculoskeletal imbalances that
need correcting.
■■Regress a stretching exercise if it causes discomfort or if clients have difficulty performing
the exercise properly.
■■Regress a stretching exercise if the equipment
requirements make it impr actical for the client
to perform it on a regular basis.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

■■Regress a stretching exercise by allowing the

client to use a balance aid or to perform the
stretch lying down or seated, or return to a suitable SMR technique for the area being targeted.
■■Progress a stretch by removing a balance aid,
performing the exercise standing, or integrating
other body parts into the movement.
■■Progress a client’s stretching program if she has
demonstrated mastery and is ready for strengthening exercises.

Reminder
Review the comprehensive information on
teaching tips, progressions and regressions,
and when not to use stretching exercises in
chapter 16 before you introduce any of the
exercises in this chapter into a client’s corrective exercise program.


Stretching Exercises

STRETCHING EXERCISE LIBRARY
The stretching exercises highlighted in this chapter should be used as part of a complete
corrective exercise program that involves both self-myofascial release and strengthening
techniques. These stretching techniques are designed to be easy to perform in a gym or
personal training setting, at home, at the office, or when traveling. The required equipment
is minimal and is readily accessible to most people.

243


Foot and Toe Stretch
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles
Imbalance(s): Overpronation and lack of dorsiflexion
Structures addressed: Plantar fascia and muscles of the lower leg that terminate on the underside of the foot
Exercise benefits: Overpronation and lack of dorsiflexion constantly stress the
muscles that wrap around the ankle and terminate on the underside of the foot,
causing them to become tight or restricted. Stretching the toes and underside
of the foot can make the foot (and ankle) more flexible, allowing these areas to
function more effectively.
How to perform
1. Stand barefoot with one foot forward and toes pushed up against a wall or
half foam roller; keep the ball of the foot and the base of the toes in contact
with the floor.
2. Slowly roll foot and ankle forward and inward (i.e., into pronation).
3. Slowly bend the knee and ankle forward toward the wall to stretch the
underside of the foot.

244


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for about 10 to 15 seconds, release,
and then repeat. Perform the cycle 1 to 3 times at least once a day on both feet.
Tip: When performing this stretch using a wall, place your hands on the wall
to help keep your hips and torso straight and square.
Precaution: If a cramping sensation or discomfort is felt on the bottom of the
foot or on the front of the ankle, ease off, regress, or stop performing this stretch.
Progress: Pronate the foot more by letting the knee fall toward the midline
of the body to increase the stretch. When performing this progression, try to
keep the hips level.

Regress: Perform the Golf Ball Roll or the Calf Massage.

245


Calf Stretch
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees
Imbalance(s): Lack of dorsiflexion and overpronation
Structures addressed: Gastrocnemius and soleus; also activates and strengthens tibialis anterior when contracted to progress exercise
Exercise benefits: When the feet overpronate, the calf muscles and Achilles
tendon can get irritated and may not be able to function effectively. This stretch
helps release and realign the calf muscles to allow better dorsiflexion of the foot
and ankle and prevent overpronation.
How to perform
1. Stand with feet in a staggered stance (one foot forward and one foot back).
2. Place your hands on a balance aid if needed (e.g., a wall in front).
3. Align your pelvis left to right and tuck it under (i.e., posteriorly rotate it).
4. Keep the arches of your feet raised, and gently lean forward, keeping both
feet in contact with the ground.

246


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for about 20 to 30 seconds, release,
and repeat. Perform this cycle on each side 1 to 2 times at least once a day.
Tip: You can vary this stretch by adding a slight bend to the back knee. This
will stretch the soleus muscle (which will help increase dorsiflexion of the ankle
when the knee is bent).
Progress: Actively pull up on the toes using the tibialis anterior muscle of the
leg that is back, or add movement by bending and straightening the back leg
while performing this stretch on a dynamic surface like a BOSU Balance Trainer.

Regress: Perform the Calf Massage.

247


Quadriceps Stretch
Area(s) of body: Knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt and tracking problems of the knee
Structures addressed: Quadriceps muscles
Exercise benefits: Increasing the flexibility of the quadriceps muscles has many
benefits. If the quadriceps are flexible (specifically the rectus femoris muscle,
which originates on the front of the pelvis), the pelvis can posteriorly rotate and
the hips can extend well. Also, since all of the quadriceps muscles attach at the
knee, they are directly responsible for helping the kneecap to track correctly.
How to perform
1. Stand facing a tall object, such as a table or counter; place one hand on the
object to stabilize your body.
2. Grab your foot with the other hand, and pull your heel up toward your
buttocks.
3. Bring your knee back while gently rotating your pelvis under (i.e., posteriorly rotating) and straightening your upper back.
4. Do not excessively arch the lower back while performing this exercise.

248


Duration and repetition: Stretch each side for 20 to 30 seconds at least once
per day.
Tip: If the foot cannot be reached, simply wrap a towel under the foot of the
leg being stretched and pull the towel toward the buttocks to feel the stretch
in the thigh.
Progress: Place the ankle or foot of the stretching leg on a counter or bench.
Use a balance aid, if needed.

Regress: Use a towel to help with the stretch, and perform the exercise while
lying down on your stomach or side.

249


Hamstring Stretch
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees, lumbo pelvic-hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt, and
excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and hip flexors; activates
and strengthens tibialis anterior and quadriceps when exercise is progressed.
Exercise benefits: When the foot overpronates, the lower leg and knee rotate
inward and the front of the pelvis tilts down. This can cause the hamstrings
to become irritated because they must overwork to stabilize the pelvis and
control the excessive rotation of the lower leg. Stretching the hamstrings can
recondition these muscles and help the feet, knees, and lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
function more effectively.
How to perform
1. Place your right leg up on a bench or chair, with your leg straight and both
feet aligned forward.
2. Pull the right side of your pelvis back and away from the right foot as you
dorsiflex the right foot.
3. Switch legs and repeat on the left leg.

250


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds, and repeat
2 to 3 cycles on each leg at least once a day.
Tip: The quadriceps muscles are antagonists of the hamstrings. Isometrically
contracting the quadriceps during this stretch will help the hamstrings to
release.
Precaution: Do not hyperextend the knee when activating the quadriceps.
Progress: Rotate the torso to the right by reaching the left hand over the right
knee, and vice versa when stretching the other leg.

Regress: Perform this stretch lying down by placing the foot up on the corner
of a wall or on a door frame. Rotate your torso for maximum benefit.

251


Glute Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, valgus knee
position, and overpronation
Structures addressed: Gluteus maximus muscle and, to a lesser extent, other
abductor muscles and hip rotators (e.g., piriformis).
Exercise benefits: Improving the flexibility of the gluteal muscles will enable
them to work better eccentrically to assist with slowing down hip flexion during
movements like squatting. This can prevent the pelvis from rotating too far down
at the front and can prevent the lower back from arching too much. Healthy
gluteal muscles also help to slow down the internal rotation of the leg, thereby
controlling movement of the knee toward the midline and helping prevent a
valgus knee position and overpronation.
How to perform
1. Sit on the floor with one leg straight out in front; bend the other leg at the
knee and cross it over the straight leg.
2. Place the crossed foot flat on the floor and gently pull the bent knee toward
the chest.
3. Be sure to keep the glute being stretched flat on the floor and do not let it
rise up.

252


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 20 to 30 seconds at least
once per day.
Tip: Keep your torso upright and shoulders level while performing this stretch
to maximize effectiveness.
Progress: Perform the Lunge With Knee Pull.

Regress: Use a countertop or bench to support the stretching leg.

253


Piriformis Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt and valgus knee position
Structures addressed: Piriformis muscle and hip rotator muscles
Exercise benefits: People who have overpronated feet usually have weak
glutes. Consequently, the much smaller piriformis muscle (and other hip rotators) may try to take over the function of the glutes, and it can become irritated
as a result. Releasing the piriformis (and other deep hip rotator muscles) and
then strengthening the glutes can help improve the function of the entire hip
and leg complex.
How to perform
1. Sit down on the floor and place your right ankle on your left knee.
2. Let the right side of the pelvis drop away from the right shoulder.
3. Hold the stretch to help release the piriformis and other hip rotator muscles.
4. Repeat with your other leg.

254


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds at least once
a day.
Tip: The sciatic nerve runs over, under, or through the piriformis muscle
(depending on the individual). An irritated piriformis muscle is often responsible
for the pain and symptoms of sciatica.
Precaution: If discomfort is felt in the groin area, ease off or stop performing
this stretch.
Progress: Perform The Pivot.

Regress: Use a tennis ball to massage the glutes, or perform the exercise lying
down.

255


Abductor Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation and valgus knee position
Structures addressed: Abductor muscles
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps increase the flexibility of the abductor
muscles so that they can work more effectively to control the movement of the
femur toward the midline of the body during weight-bearing activities like
lunging and walking.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and a pillow under your head.
2. Let one knee drop toward the midline of the body while ensuring that the
pelvis on that side does not move excessively.
3. Place the ankle of the other leg over the knee that is toward the midline,
and gently push down on the knee to increase the stretch.
4. Keep the pelvis level and flat on the ground during the stretch.
5. Repeat on the opposite side.

256


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 20 to 30 seconds at least
once per day.
Tip: Be sure to keep the back of the hips pressed into the floor while shifting
the knee toward the midline. This stretch should be felt on the outside of the
leg and hip.
Precaution: If pain is felt in the groin or lower back, regress or discontinue
the stretch.
Progress: Raise the arm on the side that is being stretched over your head or
perform the Lunge With Side Reach.

Regress: Perform the Tennis Ball Side of Hip or the Foam Roller IT Band.

257


Adductor Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Valgus knee position and excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Adductor muscles
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps increase the flexibility of the adductor
muscles so they can work more effectively during weight-bearing activities
to control the movement of the leg and hip as they go into extension (to help
prevent excessive lumbar lordosis) and the movement of the leg as it internally
rotates when the foot is in contact with the ground (to help prevent a valgus
knee position).
How to perform
1. Sit on the floor with your left leg straight and placed away from the midline
of the body (abducted) and your left foot dorsiflexed.
2. Bend the right knee and place the sole of your right foot next to the inside
of the left knee.
3. Sit upright, and do not bend the spine to the side.
4. Repeat on opposite side.

258


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 20 to 30 seconds at least
once per day.
Tip: Try to feel your “sit bones” (ischial tuberosities) in contact with the floor,
and keep the pressure even as you perform the stretch. This will help keep the
pelvis in the right place.
Precaution: If pain is felt in the knee, bend the leg that is straight slightly until
you can progress to the point that the knee can be kept straight.
Progress: Bend forward at the hips, reaching the opposite hand toward the
outstretched leg, or perform the Side Lunge With Rotation.

Regress: Foam Roller on Inner Thigh.

259


Lower Back Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive lumbar lordosis and anterior pelvic tilt
Structures addressed: Lumbar erector spinae muscles; also activates abdominals when contracted to assist with stretch
Exercise benefits: Releasing the lumbar erectors will enable the pelvis to
posteriorly rotate and the lumbar spine to flex effectively.
How to perform
1. Sit on the floor with knees bent and feet forward.
2. Grab the backs of the knees, posteriorly tilt the pelvis, and lean forward to
round the lower back.
3. The stretch should be felt in the muscles of the lower back.

260


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Repeat 2 to
3 cycles at least once a day.
Tip: Activate the abdominals to posteriorly tilt the pelvis and help flex the
lumbar spine.
Precaution: People who have lower back pain should perform this stretch very
gently and only once they are warmed up sufficiently. Discontinue immediately
if any pain is felt.
Progress: Perform this exercise standing by bending forward toward the toes.

Regress: Perform the exercise lying supine by hugging the knees to the chest.

261


Lying Rotation Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive lumbar lordosis and excessive thoracic kyphosis
Structures addressed: Internal and external obliques, biceps, and pectorals
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps increase the flexibility of the oblique
muscles to improve trunk and spine rotation. Sufficient trunk rotation helps
prevent excessive lumbar lordosis and excessive thoracic kyphosis by encouraging the spine to rotate correctly during movements such as walking, hitting
a golf ball, running, or throwing a Frisbee.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back, with knees bent and lifted up over your stomach.
2. Place a foam roller or pillow between the knees to minimize any potential
for lower back discomfort.
3. Drop the knees to the left side of the body while keeping the shoulder blades,
arms, and the palm of the right hand flat on the floor.
4. Turn your head in the direction of your legs.
5. Keep your hips bent to 90 degrees, and do not let the lower back arch.
6. Repeat the stretch on the opposite side.

262


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Repeat 2 to
3 cycles at least once a day.
Tip: Keep the pelvis tilted, and encourage clients to relax their breathing during
this stretch.
Precaution: If pain is felt in the lower back, increase the thickness of the support
prop between the legs. If pain is felt in the shoulder or chest, turn both palms up.
Progress: Remove the foam roller or pillow from between the legs, or perform
the Wall Rotation Stretch.

Regress: Perform the Foam Roller Thoracic Spine or Abdominal Massage.

263


Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal)
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Hip flexor muscle group; also activates and strengthens
the gluteus maximus and abdominals when isometrically contracted during
stretch
Exercise benefits: Stretching tight or restricted hip flexors enables the lumbar
spine to flex more easily, thereby reducing excessive lumbar lordosis. This in
turn helps the pelvis to rotate posteriorly and addresses an anterior pelvic tilt.
How to perform
1. Kneel down on your right knee with your left foot forward; tuck the pelvis
under using the glutes and abdominals to assist with this motion.
2. Align the hips straight from front to back, and then tuck the right hip in
from the side (to keep the pelvis and hips in correct alignment); this stretch
should be felt in the front of the hip (on top of the right leg).
3. Repeat on the opposite side.

264


Duration and repetitions: Hold this stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
2 to 3 cycles on each side at least once per day.
Tip: Make sure the hip stays tucked in and under by activating the glutes to
keep the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle in good alignment.
Precaution: Avoid arching the lower back when you lift your arm overhead to
progress the stretch.
Progress: Extend your right arm over your head (if your left foot is forward)
and vice versa, or perform the Door Frame Stretch.

Regress: Round your lower back during the stretch, and use the rectus abdominis muscle to help tilt the pelvis under.

265


Hip Flexor Stretch (Frontal)
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and valgus knee
position
Structures addressed: Hip flexor muscles, quadratus lumborum, obliques;
also activates and strengthens gluteus maximus and abdominals
Exercise benefits: Stretching the hip flexors in the frontal plane (i.e., from
side to side) helps the pelvis, hips, and legs to move laterally more easily to take
stress off the lower back and knees as weight is transferred from left to right
during activities like walking and running.
How to perform
1. Kneel down on one knee; tuck the pelvis under using the glutes and abdominals to assist with this motion.
2. Raise your arm over your head on the same side as the kneeling leg, and
reach over the head toward the opposite side of the body.
3. Repeat on opposite side.

266


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
2 to 3 cycles on each side at least once per day.
Tip: If there is difficulty activating the glute, try rounding the lower back to
help activate this muscle.
Progress: Perform the Door Frame Stretch or the Gluteal Activation Over Ball.

Regress: Do not raise the arm over the head.

267


Hip Flexor Stretch (Transverse)
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and excessive thoracic kyphosis
Structures addressed: Hip flexor muscles and obliques; also activates and
strengthens gluteus maximus and abdominals
Exercise benefits: As the hip and leg go into extension during activities like
walking and running, the torso rotates over the front leg. The flexibility of
the hip flexors in the transverse plane (i.e., in rotation) helps displace stress
correctly through the legs, the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, and the thoracic spine.
How to perform
1. Kneel down on one knee; tuck the pelvis under using the glutes and abdominals to assist with this motion.
2. Rotate your arms across your chest; make sure your body does not shift
to the right or left.
3. Rotate the upper torso across the front leg; keep your head facing straight
ahead; extend your arms to achieve a greater stretch.
4. Keep your shoulders level during the stretch.
5. Repeat on the opposite side.

268


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
2 to 3 cycles on each side at least once per day.
Tip: If you feel pressure on the kneecap during this exercise, place a pad or
mat under the knee.
Progress: Perform the Wall Rotation Stretch.

Regress: Perform the Foam Roller Hip Flexors.

269


Door Frame Stretch
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle and thoracic spine
Imbalance(s): Tracking problems of the knee, excessive lumbar lordosis, and
excessive thoracic kyphosis
Structures addressed: Iliotibial band, abductors, obliques, latissimus dorsi,
and quadratus lumborum
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps increase the flexibility of many of the
muscles that help facilitate side-to-side movement of the legs, hips, and spine
(and rotation of the trunk) to improve the function of the entire kinetic chain.
How to perform
1. Stand in a door frame; reach one arm over your head and grasp the side
of the frame above head level; place the other hand lower on the frame at
thigh level.
2. Tuck the foot farthest from the hands behind the other foot; push the hips
away from the hands to stretch the side of your body that is away from the
door frame.
3. To increase the stretch, gently rotate the sternum under the arm that is
overhead while preventing the hips from rotating.
4. Repeat on the opposite side.

270


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 10 to 15 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times at least once per day.
Tip: To maximize the effectiveness of this exercise, keep your pelvis tucked
under and extend your torso upright from the thoracic spine and rib cage.
Precaution: If discomfort is felt in the lower back during this exercise, place
the feet hip width apart rather than crossing them over each other.
Progress: Perform the Straight Arm Raise or the Lunge With Arm Raise.

Regress: Perform the Hip Flexor Stretch (Frontal).

271


Chest Stretch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle, elevated
scapula, and internally rotated arms
Structures addressed: Stretches the pectorals; also activates and strengthens
the rhomboids and lower fibers of the trapezius when contracted isometrically
to assist with the exercise
Exercise benefits: Increasing the flexibility of the pectoral muscles and subsequently strengthening the shoulder retractors and depressors (e.g., rhomboids and lower trapezius) will help to retract and depress the shoulder blades,
externally rotate the arms, and allow the thoracic spine to extend effectively.
How to perform
1. Stand about 2 feet away from a wall with the body turned 90 degrees away
from the wall.
2. Reach your left hand behind your body, and place the palm flat on the wall.
3. Pull the left shoulder blade back and down to feel the stretch in the front
of the left shoulder and chest.
4. Repeat on the opposite side.

272


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
2 to 3 cycles on each side at least once per day.
Tip: Massaging the pectoral muscles while performing this stretch will help
increase the effectiveness of this exercise. This stretch can also be performed
in a door frame.
Progress: Perform the Wave Goodbye or the Seated Row.

Regress: Perform Chest Massage.

273


Biceps Stretch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Elevated scapula and protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Biceps muscles
Exercise benefits: Imbalances of the shoulder girdle can cause the biceps to
become tight and restricted, thereby compounding movement issues in this
area. Increasing the flexibility of these muscles (especially the biceps brachii,
as it originates on the scapula) will enable the shoulder blades to retract and
depress to achieve better alignment of the glenohumeral joint.
How to perform
1. Face away from a high countertop or a window sill; rotate one arm behind
you and place your hand (thumb side down) on the surface, keeping the
arm straight.
2. Pull your shoulder back and down and bend your knees until you feel a
stretch in the biceps.
3. Repeat on the other side.

274


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each arm for 20 to 30 seconds at least
once per day.
Tip: This exercise is great for people who have their elbows bent throughout
the day, like those who type on a computer or drive for many hours.
Progress: Make a fist around the thumb and pronate the wrist (i.e., bend and
turn it inward) to include the muscles and fascia of the forearm and wrist in
this stretch.

Regress: Perform the Tennis Ball on Biceps or the Lying Front of Shoulder
Stretch.

275


Why Stretch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, elevated scapula, protracted shoulder girdle, and internally rotated arms
Structures addressed: Subscapularis and pectorals; also activates and
strengthens the rhomboids, lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and teres minor
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps correct muscle imbalances in the thoracic spine, shoulder girdle, and arm (the glenohumeral joint) by stretching the
chest and the front of the shoulder while strengthening the rhomboids, lower
trapezius (traps), and external rotators of the shoulder and arm.
How to perform
1. Stand upright, with your pelvis tilted posteriorly and your arms externally
rotated out to the sides.
2. Contract the rhomboids and external rotators of the arm to help pull the
arms and shoulders back while activating the lower traps to help pull the
shoulders down.

276


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times on each side at least once per day.
Tip: This stretch can also be done while seated at a desk chair by hanging the
arms to the side.
Precaution: Keep your pelvis posteriorly tilted throughout this exercise to
ensure that the movement is not initiated through the lower back.
Progress: Perform the Shoulder Retraction on Floor exercise.

Regress: Perform the Front of Shoulder Massage or Chest Massage.

277


Lying Front of Shoulder Stretch
Imbalance(s): Protracted shoulder girdle, elevated scapula, and internally
rotated arms
Structures addressed: Front of shoulder, pectorals, and biceps; also activates
and strengthens rhomboids and lower trapezius
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps increase flexibility of the muscles in
the front of the shoulder and arm. Increased flexibility in this area will enable
the arm to rotate correctly in the shoulder joint while the scapula remains in
the correct position on the rib cage.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with knees bent; use a pillow to keep your head and neck
neutral, if needed.
2. Place one arm slightly away from the body on the floor palm down; keep
the arm straight.
3. Use the muscles that retract and depress the shoulder blades (the rhomboids
and lower trapezius) to gently pull the shoulder back and down toward the
floor until a stretch is felt in the front of the shoulder and the top of the arm.
4. A neck stretch can be incorporated into this exercise by turning your head
away from the shoulder being stretched.

278


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times at least once per day.
Tip: Massaging the front of the shoulder, chest, biceps, and forearm before
performing this stretch is highly recommended to improve the effectiveness
of this exercise.
Precaution: If pain is felt in the front of the shoulder, turn the palm slightly
upward during this stretch.
Progress: Bend your elbow and place the hand of the side you are stretching
under the lower back to increase the stretch.

Regress: Perform the Front of Shoulder Massage or the Biceps Stretch.

279


Neck Extensors Stretch
Area(s) of body: Head and neck
Imbalance(s): Excessive cervical lordosis
Structures addressed: Neck extensors; also strengthens the neck flexors
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps release tightness in the neck extensors
caused by excessive cervical lordosis. This stretch can also be progressed to
activate and strengthen the neck flexors.
How to perform
1. Place your hands on the crown of your head, keep your elbows together,
and pull your shoulders down using the lower traps.
2. Pull your chin to your chest to feel the stretch in the back of the neck and
shoulders.
3. This exercise can be performed either standing or while seated.

280


Duration and repetitions: Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times at least once per day.
Tip: The neck flexors can also be activated during this stretch (which will help
relax the neck extensors) by dropping the arms and actively pulling your chin
to your chest.
Precaution: Perform this exercise slowly. Discontinue immediately if any pain
or discomfort is felt in the neck.
Progress: Perform Neck Flexion (Lying) or (Seated).

Regress: Perform the Theracane Back of Neck.

281


Trapezius Stretch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, neck, and head
Imbalance(s): Elevated scapula, excessive cervical lordosis
Structures addressed: Upper fibers of trapezius muscle; also activates and
strengthens the lower fibers of the trapezius muscle and rhomboids when contracted isometrically during exercise
Exercise benefits: This exercise targets the upper fibers of the trapezius
muscle, which can become tight and restricted as a result of excessive cervical
lordosis. Increasing the flexibility of the upper traps will allow the shoulder
blades to depress and the neck to flex more easily.
How to perform
1. Sit on a stool or chair; fi rmly grasp the back leg or seat of the chair on one
side and pull the shoulder blade back and down.
2. Maintain a fi rm grip and bend the neck away from the hand that is grasping the chair.
3. Engage the lower trapezius and rhomboid muscles on the side being
stretched to help pull the shoulder into correct alignment so the upper
trapezius can release.
4. Repeat on the opposite side.

282


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times at least once per day.
Tip: Keep your chin tucked in as the neck is bent to the side during this stretch.
Precaution: Do not rotate the head and neck when bending it to the side.
Progress: Perform the Straight Arm Pulldown.

Regress: Perform the Theracane on Trapezius.

283


Palm on Wall Stretch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, neck, and head
Imbalance(s): Internally rotated arms, protracted shoulder girdle, and elevated
scapula
Structures addressed: Upper fibers of trapezius, biceps, and flexors of the
hand and wrist; also activates and strengthens the rhomboids and the lower
fibers of the trapezius
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps increase the flexibility of the muscles of
the arm and shoulder while stabilizing the scapula to help improve the function
of the glenohumeral joint and shoulder girdle.
How to perform
1. Stand beside a wall with your arm extended out to the side and your palm
flat on the wall; spread your fi ngers slightly and hold the shoulder back
and down.
2. Try to straighten your arm fully; do not let the shoulder come up and forward.

284


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times on each side at least once per day.
Tip: This stretch may be felt in a number of places (i.e., hand, wrist, forearm,
biceps, or the underside of the upper arm). Make a note of where the stretch
is felt the most, and perform self-myofascial release techniques to help release
those areas before repeating the stretch.
Progress: Rotate the arm forward (internally) while stabilizing the scapula.

Regress: Turn your body toward the wall to decrease the stretch, or perform
Forearm Massage.

285


Forearm Stretch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Internally rotated arms, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Forearm muscles
Exercise benefits: Increasing flexibility in the forearm and wrist will help
the entire arm be able to function better without compensations occurring at
the shoulder.
How to perform
1. Extend your arms out in front of your body; keep them straight, and cradle
the back of one hand in the other.
2. Gently bend the wrist and fi ngers of the hand being held toward the torso
until a stretch is felt in the outside of the forearm.

286


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 20 to 30 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times at least once per day.
Tip: Keep your shoulders back and down to maximize the effectiveness of this
exercise.
Progress: Rotate the forearm internally to increase the stretch.

Regress: Perform Forearm Massage.

287


Wall Rotation Stretch
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Lack of dorsiflexion, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, excessive thoracic kyphosis, and protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Gastrocnemius, hip flexors, abdominals, pectorals, and
latissimus dorsi; also activates and strengthens the gluteus maximus, spinal
erectors, rhomboids, and lower fibers of the trapezius
Exercise benefits: This stretch mimics many body movements that are
required for correct walking and running mechanics. It increases the flexibility of the ankle (to improve dorsiflexion), the flexibility of the hips (to improve
pelvis and lumbar spine function), and the flexibility of the trunk and scapula
(to improve spine and shoulder function). It is a great progression for combining
and coordinating the entire kinetic chain.
How to perform
1. Stand sideways to a wall in a split stance with the foot that is closer to the
wall forward.
2. Rotate the upper torso toward the wall, but keep the head, hips, legs, and
feet facing straight forward.
3. Place both palms flat against the wall.
4. Hold the stretch without lifting the heels off the ground or shifting the
spine or hips to the side.

288


Duration and repetitions: Stretch each side for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat
the cycle 2 to 3 times at least once per day.
Tip: If there is difficulty remembering which foot to put forward when doing
this stretch, simply mimic the movement of walking by rotating the torso and
arms over the front leg.
Precaution: Holding your breath during this stretch may cause muscle cramping
and tension around the torso. It is important to relax and breathe continuously
when performing this exercise.
Progress: Perform the Lunge To Step Up (with Rotation).

Regress: Perform the Hip Flexor Stretch (Transverse) or Two Tennis Balls on
Upper Back.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Review of Key Points
Stretching exercises are introduced into a corrective exercise program once the client has
performed the self-myofascial release techniques required to rejuvenate and regenerate
unhealthy muscles and fascia.
■■Stretches introduce range of motion to joints, muscles, and other soft tissues in prepara-

tion for the strengthening phase of a corrective exercise program.
■■Introduce stretching exercises gradually into a client’s program. Previous experiences

of pain, muscle tension, joint inflammation, guarding, and movement restrictions can all
influence the types and intensity of stretches needed.
■■There are many ways to regress and progress a client’s stretching program, such as adding

or removing balance aids and incorporating or excluding other body parts.
■■Use your knowledge of functional anatomy to select appropriate stretches, and teach clients

where they should feel each stretch.
■■Use stretching cautiously with clients who have chronic musculoskeletal imbalances, arthri-

tis, osteoporosis, or a history of steroid use, or who have recently had surgery or an injury.
■■Do not try to stretch tissues surrounding a broken bone, areas that have sustained trauma,

or joints or soft tissues that are acutely inflamed.

Self-Check
It is crucial to know how and when to progress a client’s corrective exercise program from
self-myofascial release techniques to stretching exercises. Following are examples of musculoskeletal problems and appropriate self-myofascial release techniques. In the second column,
identify a suitable stretching exercise for each client to progress to, and briefly explain why
you selected that stretch. The first situation has been completed as an example.
Client situation/imbalance with appropriate selfmyofascial release technique identified
A client has pain at the front of her ankle when she walks
long distances. Your assessment reveals that she has
limited dorsiflexion. She has been performing a Calf Massage.
A client experiences neck pain at the end of a long day
sitting at his computer. Your assessment reveals that he
has excessive cervical lordosis. He has been performing
Theracane on Back of Neck.
A client gets pain on the inside of her right knee after she
plays tennis. Your assessment reveals that she has overpronated feet. She has been performing the Golf Ball Roll.
A client complains of lower back pain after playing golf.
Your assessment reveals that he has an anterior pelvic
tilt. He has been performing the Foam Roller on Gluteal
Complex.

Recommended stretch
Calf Stretch (standing). Increasing flexibility of the calf
muscles in a weight-bearing situation will enable the lower
leg to come forward over the foot and improve the client’s
ability to dorsiflex, thereby eliminating pain in the front of
her ankle when she walks.
