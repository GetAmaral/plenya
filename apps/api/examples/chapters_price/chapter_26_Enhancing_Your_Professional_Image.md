# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 26: Enhancing Your Professional Image

CHAPTER 26
Enhancing Your
Professional Image
Throughout this text, at the conclusion of each
chapter, there have been a series of Self-Checks
designed to build your confidence surrounding the
use of corrective exercise skills in real-life settings.
Polishing your skills will enhance your ability to help
people with musculoskeletal imbalances and begin
to bolster your professional image.
As your practical corrective exercise knowledge
improves, it is time to focus on developing a professional image that will reflect your abilities. You want
to position yourself as a knowledgeable professional
in the field of corrective exercise and attract people
to use your services. This will require integrating
structural assessments and corrective exercise into
your business offerings (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Adding corrective exercise services to your existing fitness business, or beginning a new service
dedicated to corrective exercise, is a great way to
help people with musculoskeletal limitations and
muscle and joint pain. It also gives you an opportunity to profit from this rapidly growing service area.
To do this, you must
1. cultivate an image of yourself as a knowledgeable and successful professional proficient in
corrective exercise, and
2. consistently use specific, systemized, and
effective corrective exercise procedures when
working with clients.
When you consistently use your assessment and
corrective exercise skills, you strengthen your image

as a trusted professional. Making the effort to shape
your professional image will enable you to more
easily attract new clients and introduce corrective
exercise services to your current clients.

PERFECTING YOUR
PROTOCOLS AND
PROCEDURES
When you first begin to integrate The BioMechanics Method protocols, assessments, and exercises
into your service offerings, it will be natural to
experiment to see what works best for your business. However, avoid making it appear that you are
applying the procedures in a random fashion; it
will only diminish your effectiveness and damage
your image. Instead, refer back to this textbook as
often as needed to remind you of the step-by-step
nature of the assessments and exercise protocols.
You should also regularly practice the communication and teaching techniques as they are presented
in this text, and create procedures for their implementation. The routine application of these methods
will help refine your skills and establish you as an
experienced professional (Gerber 2001).
Following is a summary of important points about
presenting corrective exercise procedures to clients.
■■Be straightforward and concise about what

potential clients should expect during their
initial consultation. Providing clear instructions

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

will help to reduce their anxiety about their first
meeting with you (Price and Bratcher 2010).
■■Make people feel comfortable and confident
about consulting with you by having protocols in
place for welcoming all new or potential clients
(Norman 1999).
■■Conduct each initial consultation in a similar
fashion using The BioMechanics Method format
for verbal, visual, and hands-on assessment
(Price and Bratcher 2010).
■■Once you have completed your assessments,
summarize the findings for clients in a jargon-free manner, and answer any questions they
may have about their results.
■■Explain the corrective exercise strategies you
intend to teach to help them resolve their musculoskeletal issues. Base your recommendations
on the assessment results, and link your strategies directly to ways they can improve a client’s
condition.
■■Conclude the initial consultation with an
explanation of your use of client workbooks,
the number of sessions the client may require,
and your rates.
■■Whether working with a new corrective exercise
client or integrating corrective exercise into a
current client’s program, the procedures are
exactly same. All sessions should include:
1. A review of all homework exercises at the
start of each session.
2. Exercise recommendations based on findings from the review process and the client’s primary fitness goals.
3. Continual use of assessments during exercise sessions to provide feedback for both
you and the client. Performing assessments
after your client has successfully adhered
to his corrective exercise program for a few
weeks will help to reinforce his efforts; it
will also produce information you may need
for program adjustments (O’Donohue and
Levensky 2006).

IMPROVING YOUR IMAGE
TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS
Perfecting your assessment and exercise procedures
is an ongoing process. As you work on this aspect of
your professional identity, you will find it necessary
to expand the number and variety of people with
whom you interact. Whether you are an existing

fitness business owner or starting a new enterprise,
you will need to attract new clients to your services.
“You only get one chance to make a first impression” is a saying that is particularly relevant in terms
of developing your professional image. Potential
clients will make judgments and assumptions
about your credibility and skills based on their first
encounter with you (Galai, Hillel, and Wiener 2016;
Sobel and Sheth 2000). It is vital to convey to any
prospective client that you know exactly what you
are doing. There are many ways to instill feelings of
confidence about your services. Following are some
suggestions.

BUSINESS NAME AND LOGO
Your business name (and logo, if you have one) is
the first thing people see when they consider using
your services. Therefore, your business name and
logo should reflect your commitment to helping
people with corrective exercise needs. Many fitness
professionals choose business names that they think
will be motivational for clients, such as John’s Buff
Bodies or Lean and Trim with LeAnn. However,
names like these may intimidate prospective corrective exercise clients because these people often
do not feel confident in their physical abilities and
appearance. More appropriate names would include
references to improved function and movement—for
example, Movement Matters, or Functional Fitness.
Similarly, logos can easily send the wrong message
(Price 2003). When thinking about your business
name and logo, be prepared to revise them a few
times to ensure that you are communicating your
services and business image as intended.

PERSONAL APPEARANCE
Another crucial aspect of portraying yourself in
a professional manner is your appearance, which
includes your clothing, grooming, and demeanor.
While fitness environments are more tolerant of
casual dress standards, avoid dressing in shorts
and tank tops or in revealing fitness outfits. Choose
clothing that gives the impression you are a professional who provides services to like-minded professionals and people who are serious about reaching
their goals. You may even want to consider branding
your apparel or investing in a style makeover that
reflects your professionalism and service offerings.
Looking the part goes a long way toward convincing
people that you have the skills and expertise that go
along with your appearance (Price 2003). Portraying
a professional image will also boost your confidence
when dealing with clients. This will come across to


Enhancing Your Professional Image

prospective clients and will help you to turn more
initial consultations into sales. Furthermore, if you
give the impression that you are a knowledgeable
and successful professional, clients who seek you
out will expect to pay a premium for your services.

LOCATION, FACILITY, AND
EQUIPMENT
The appearance of your place of business should
also convey your professional status. People should
know from looking around your premises that you
regularly integrate corrective exercise techniques
into your business offerings. While it is easier to
create this type of atmosphere if you own the facility, you need not own the place if you are savvy in
the use of props. The inclusion of some or all of the
following items will help create the impression of a
well-qualified professional:
1. Textbooks. Several books relating to musculoskeletal health, corrective exercise, or
biomechanics should be visible to potential
customers. If you do not have a regular workplace where you can easily display these items,
bring a few books with you to meetings and
consultations for use as visual aids.
2. Anatomy props. If at all possible, have a small
anatomy skeleton in your office or consultation
space. It is a very handy prop that creates a
good impression for clients. It can also be used
during your structural assessment procedures
to help explain results.
3. Equipment. Foam rollers and other selfmyofascial release tools are great conversation
starters that can pique the interest of a prospective client. Keep these types of equipment in
view so that your place of business becomes
recognizable as a facility that offers corrective
exercise procedures.

WEBSITE
The Internet and social media have forever changed
the way people seek out goods and services. In
today’s consumer world, 80 percent of people
research a company online before making a purchasing decision (Lamb, Hair, and McDaniel 2017).
The creation (or redesign) and promotion of a wellthought-out and professionally constructed website
is absolutely necessary for helping potential clients
find out more about your services. A website, particularly one with links to your company’s social
media platforms, may also facilitate referrals from
current clients and other professionals who may

want to endorse your services.
In chapter 27, you will learn how to further
develop your website, expand your corrective exercise offerings, and drive traffic to your site. However,
during the initial business development stages
(before you invest substantial time and money in an
expensive website), there are a number of low-cost
strategies you can use on your site that will enhance
your professional image and help to reflect your commitment to providing specialty skills in corrective
exercise (Price and Bratcher 2012).

DETAIL YOUR AVAILABLE
SERVICES
Research has found that more than 47 percent of
potential customers look at a company’s products
and services before checking out any other section
of their website (Huff, Edmond, and Gillette 2015).
Make it easy for customers with musculoskeletal
pain and dysfunction to determine if at least some of
your services appeal to them. For example, you may
want to include a section in the menu bar or list of
services titled Muscle and Joint Pain, or Injury Prevention—anything that potential clients can identify
with when they look up your available services.

LINK TO BLOGS AND ARTICLES
Include links on your website to articles and blogs
about corrective exercise, the causes and cures for
various injuries, or biomechanics. This is another
way to establish yourself as an authoritative source
of information. If you are confident in your writing
skills, consider posting your own articles and blogs
on your website to make potential customers aware
of your specialty knowledge. However, it is not necessary to create articles and blogs yourself. It is always
better to link and give credit to a well-written, professionally created piece than to display work that
may harm, rather than enhance, your credibility.

HIGHLIGHT YOUR
QUALIFICATIONS
Obtaining and maintaining specialty certifications
in corrective exercise is an essential part of crafting a professional appearance. Highlighting these
qualifications on your website or mentioning them
on your About Us page will help reassure prospective
clients about your skills and knowledge.

CONNECT TO SOCIAL MEDIA
Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are used by three billion people around the world
(Lamb, Hair, and McDaniel 2017). That’s nearly half

383

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

of the population on Earth! You can effectively use
these platforms to publicize your corrective exercise
talents and link them back to your website. If you
are short on content for your social media platforms,
link to posts from other sites that offer corrective
exercise strategies and solutions for musculoskeletal
problems.

OFFER NEWSLETTERS
The addition of a weekly, monthly, or quarterly
newsletter dedicated to corrective exercise that
customers can sign up for on your site is another
way to bolster your image while gathering contact information for future marketing purposes.
Smart topics could include sample exercises that
demonstrate how to alleviate certain aches and
pains. Current clients can benefit from the information, but more importantly, they may forward
the newsletter to their friends and family. This
can help increase your exposure and strengthen
your reputation.

HIGHLIGHT SUCCESS STORIES
Potential clients like to see that a business has
a proven track record helping people like themselves. Include an area on your website that
highlights testimonials and success stories from
people you are currently helping or have assisted
in the past.

INTEGRATING CORRECTIVE
EXERCISE PROTOCOLS
WITH CURRENT CLIENTS
If you already run a successful fitness business, you
may be somewhat less focused on attracting new
clients because you already have an established
client base. While this is an advantage from an
income standpoint, it can make it hard to change
your existing practices and services. Clients who
are used to a particular exercise routine may not
feel comfortable if you decide to incorporate different features into their programs. However, almost
90 percent of all fitness clients will experience
musculoskeletal limitations at one time or another.
So your continued success depends on finding ways
to begin integrating musculoskeletal assessment
and corrective exercise strategies (Schroeder and
Donlin 2013). The following strategies can help you
to do this.

CREATE AWARENESS OF
YOUR NEW SKILLS
Integrating corrective exercise into your current
programs is much easier to do if you arouse your
clients’ curiosity about it (Conrad 1998). Tell them
about books you are currently reading, talk with
them about courses you are taking on the subject,
and share insights from any conferences you attend
that may be pertinent to their circumstances. This
will make them aware of your interests in this area.
Moreover, when you start discussing corrective
exercise and biomechanics with clients, many will
start telling you about their own aches, pains, and
movement issues. They may also tell you about all
the people they know who have similar issues, and
they may ask whether corrective exercise can help.
Starting a dialogue about corrective exercise provides the perfect segue to introducing it into your
current clients’ programs.

BEGIN PROGRAM CHANGES
Once you have started a conversation about corrective
exercise and its benefits, take every opportunity to
demonstrate how it can be included in people’s exercise programs. Following are several ways to familiarize current clients with your newfound talents while
enhancing your professional image in the process.

OFFER FREE TRIALS
A free offer or trial of your corrective exercise services is an excellent way to enable current clients
to experience your new skills and to earn their
trust (Kumar and Meenakshi 2011). Simply suggest
that they arrive 10 minutes early for their regular
sessions so that you can show them a new assessment or exercise. This gives you the opportunity to
pique their interest without taking time away from
their normal appointments. You can either perform
an assessment on a body part or teach them one or
two self-myofascial release warm-up techniques to
help them prepare for their scheduled workouts. As
they express further interest in corrective exercise,
you can show them some stretches or corrective
strengthening techniques.

ASSESS IMBALANCES DURING
WORKOUTS
Integrate corrective exercise into clients’ fitness
programs by using musculoskeletal assessments


Enhancing Your Professional Image

during their normal workouts. For example, if a
client doing a squat complains that the front of her
ankle is hurting, stop the exercise and perform a
quick visual or hands-on assessment of her foot and
ankle to see if she is overpronating (see chapter 2).
You can use assessment procedures to demonstrate
your knowledge of the musculoskeletal system, help
your client to understand the possible cause of the
ankle problem, and offer some solutions.

FOLLOW UP AFTER SESSIONS
Whenever you teach clients to perform a corrective
exercise, follow up with them later to review their
technique. This review gives clients an opportunity
to ask questions. It also gives you the opportunity
to give them positive feedback about the gains they
have made by using corrective exercise techniques.
This will increase their acceptance of corrective
exercise as part of a regular exercise program (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

PROVIDE REMINDERS OF YOUR
CORRECTIVE EXERCISE TALENTS
Seize opportunities as they arise to remind clients of
your corrective exercise skills. While this may take
time, there are many tactics you can use.
■■Each time you teach a current client a new

corrective exercise, take a picture of him performing the exercise. This will make him feel
involved in the process and convey that you
are choosing exercises that address his specific
condition. Email or text these pictures to him
after his session, or print them out so he can
take the images with him.
■■Cooperate with clients to write the directions
for their exercise homework. Include written
instructions with accompanying photographs
whenever possible. Not only are pictures and
instructions a great way to give clients a physical
reminder of their positive experience with your
corrective exercise services, but it will also help
them feel they have provided valuable input into
their programs.
■■Create personalized program workbooks for
current clients, the same as you would for new
clients, so they can track and record their progress. This tangible evidence of their efforts
and achievements provides valuable positive
feedback that will also enhance their perception
of you as a corrective exercise specialist.

RUN AN OPEN HOUSE
Introducing clients to your corrective exercise skills
individually is a very effective way to bolster their
esteem for your professional capabilities. But you
can also reach a wider audience of both existing and
potential clients by holding an open house. An open
house is an event that showcases your corrective
exercise services. You don’t need to own your own
facility to host one; you can simply hold it at your
gym, club, or current work location. Here are some
tips to ensure open house success:
■■Choose a corrective exercise–related topic you

feel comfortable talking about.
■■Devise a name for the open house related to that
topic, such as Get Your Feet in Shape or Great
Exercises to Alleviate Back Pain, so that people
know what to expect by attending.
■■Choose a date for the open house, and advertise
it by sending out invitations to all of your contacts and current clients, posting it in your social
media platforms, and placing notices around the
location where the event is being held.
■■Send out a press release to local newspapers
and other community organizations to inform
them of the event (Price and Bratcher 2012).
(Information on how to write a press release
can be found in chapter 27.)
■■On the day of the open house, give a 10- to
15-minute talk for attendees about your chosen
topic, use your new skeleton, textbooks, and
charts to help illustrate your knowledge, and
include demonstrations on how to perform a
couple of exercises to help alleviate musculoskeletal issues related to the topic being discussed.
■■Conclude the presentation by inviting those
who are interested to attend a subsequent talk
or to schedule an appointment with you for an
assessment.
In addition to your own presentation at the open
house, you could invite other like-minded health professionals to give a short talk or demonstration about
their businesses. For example, a massage therapist
could talk and then perform brief 10-minute massages on some of the attendees. This will serve not
only to help attendees feel physically better when
they leave your event, but it also enables you to begin
developing your network of professional referrals
(Price and Bratcher 2012). (For more on networking
and referrals, see chapter 28.)

where Justin talks about how to enhance your
professional image.

KEYS TO SUCCESS
Enhancing your professional image involves two
interconnected concepts: (1) applying your skills
consistently and successfully and (2) looking the
part of a knowledgeable and proficient practitioner. As you begin publicizing or expanding your

services, however, be careful in the claims you
make. Clients with long-standing and recurring
musculoskeletal issues may doubt that a health
and fitness professional can improve their musculoskeletal conditions because they may have had
previous negative experiences. Therefore, when
crafting your professional image, you must use
descriptions and examples that are unambiguous,
grounded in reality, and supported by results.
You also want them to instill a sense of hope,
confidence, and optimism in the people seeking
out your services.

Review of Key Points
■■Professionals in any industry have methods to ensure that no part of their process or

service is overlooked. You can integrate corrective exercise into your business by consistently applying The BioMechanics Method procedures and practices.
■■As you gain competence and confidence in your skills, it is important to enhance your

professional image so that you can attract new clients and expand your services to
existing clients.
■■First impressions count. Giving the impression that you are a knowledgeable and pro-

fessional specialist in the field of corrective exercise will reassure prospective clients.
■■You can enhance your professional image by creating an appropriate business name and

website, wearing professional attire, and making sure your place of business conveys
that image.
■■Part of honing your skills involves integrating assessment and corrective exercise

procedures into your services to current clients. Doing so will elevate your status as a
professional in their eyes, and it will also improve your chances of success with their
current fitness programs.
