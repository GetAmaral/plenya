## Chapter 5: Assessing the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

CHAPTER 5
Assessing the Thoracic Spine
and Shoulder Girdle
The thoracic spine and shoulder girdle region
includes the thoracic portion of the spine, the rib
cage, the shoulder girdle, and the upper arms.
These components provide functions that are vital
to our existence and integral to our movements.
The thoracic spine can move forward and backward, side-to-side, and in rotation (Middleditch
and Oliver 2005). The rib cage, which attaches to
the thoracic spine, is involved in protecting the
organs, facilitating breathing, and supporting the
structures of the upper body. The shoulder girdle
(the means by which the upper arm attaches to the
torso with the help of the clavicles and scapulae)
articulates with the thoracic spine by means of
muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and nerves
(McMinn 2005).

BASIC ANATOMY
The thoracic spine is the part of the spine between
the lumbar and cervical segments. It contains the 12
vertebrae in the middle and upper torso area (Middleditch and Oliver 2005). The thoracic vertebrae
are medium sized and have more limited movement
capabilities than the lumbar vertebrae (McGill 2016).
However, they are generally more stable due to their
support from the rib cage (Middleditch and Oliver
2005). The rib cage is made up of 24 ribs (12 on
each side of the thoracic spine) that attach by cartilage to the sternum at the front of the chest and
to the sides of each thoracic vertebra at the back.
The bottom two sets of ribs do not attach to the

sternum and are known as floating ribs (Schenck
1999). The sternum is a T-shaped bone at the top
and center of the front of the rib cage to which the
clavicles (collarbones) attach (Goldfinger 1991).
The clavicle extends outward from the sternum
and across to the acromion to help form the front
of the shoulder girdle. The acromion is a part of
the scapula (shoulder blade) that extends over the
top of the humerus (upper arm bone), forming the
upper border of the shoulder girdle. The scapula is
a broad, flat bone that sits on the back of the upper
rib cage, forming the back of the shoulder girdle.
The humerus articulates with the shoulder joint
via the labrum, a ring of cartilage on the edge of
the scapula that gives the end of the upper arm a
cup-shaped socket in which to sit (Dimon and Day
2008). All the movements of the shoulder are highly
complex and depend on precise articulation of all the
bones, tendons, ligaments, and fasciae in this area
of the body (see figure 5.1).

COMMON DEVIATIONS
There are four main deviations that can cause pain,
injury, and movement dysfunction in the thoracic
spine and shoulder girdle (Imhoff et al. 2016):
■■Excessive thoracic kyphosis
■■Protracted shoulder girdle
■■Internally rotated arms
■■Elevated scapula

The thoracic spine naturally has a mild forwardshaped curve called a kyphotic curve. A greater than
normal curvature of the thoracic spine is referred
to as excessive thoracic kyphosis. Excessive
thoracic kyphosis disrupts the function of the entire
shoulder girdle (Brumitt 2010).
A protracted shoulder girdle occurs when
the shoulder blades move forward on the rib cage,
causing their vertebral borders (the edges closest
to the spine) to move away from the spine (Petty
and Moore 2002). Protraction of the shoulder blades
also protracts the entire shoulder girdle, moving the
acromions and collarbones forward and out of alignment (Muscolino 2011). When the shoulder girdle
protracts, it affects the position of the glenohumeral
joint, causing the upper arm to rotate inward toward
the midline of the body. This position of the upper
arms in the shoulder joints is referred to as internally rotated arms (Solberg 2008).
An elevated scapula refers to an atypical,
upward position of the shoulder blade as it sits upon
the rib cage. Elevated shoulder blades, a protracted
shoulder girdle, internally rotated arms, and excessive thoracic kyphosis are inherently linked, and
they limit shoulder function and range of motion
in the arms, in the upper torso, and throughout the
body (Johnson 2012).

where Justin talks about common deviations
of the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle.

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Having reviewed the structural anatomy of the
thoracic spine and shoulder girdle and the common

imbalances clients are likely to have in this area, we
can proceed to the detailed assessment procedures.

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
When assessing the thoracic spine and shoulder
girdle, it is important to learn how clients perceive
their condition or pain, both in isolation and in
relation to other body areas and when performing
activities (Price and Bratcher 2010). Ask about the
following topics, and write down any pertinent information on the Client Assessment Diagram (CAD).
1. Ask if the client has ever experienced pain in
the mid- to upper back, chest, shoulders, neck,
rib cage, or abdomen, and ask for the specific
location of the pain. Where on the shoulder
does it occur? Is it under the shoulder blade
or armpit? On the back or side of the neck? In
the middle of one side of the chest? (Petty and
Moore 2002). For example, if a client describes
pain on the top of her shoulder blade (or on
the side or back of her neck), this may indicate
that her shoulder blade is elevated on that
side, resulting in muscle tightness and tension. Obtaining such detailed information will
prompt you to check further during the visual
and hands-on assessments.
2. Ask whether the client has arthritis or any
other diagnosed condition that may affect the
musculoskeletal health of the thoracic spine
and shoulder girdle. For example, clients with a
diagnosis of arthritis in their acromioclavicular
joint (the top of the shoulder) may experience
pain and dysfunction that could affect the success of a corrective exercise program (Cramer
and Darby 2014). Some conditions may require
outside assistance, and this can help you to


Assessing the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

develop valuable referral relationships with
medical professionals (for more on scope of
practice, networks, and referrals, see chapter
28) (Price and Bratcher 2010).
3. Ask about the client’s past injuries or surgeries. For example, a torn rotator cuff muscle or
a fusion of vertebrae in the thoracic spine may
limit movements and functions, and this will
affect program design (Petty and Moore 2002).
4. Ask about the client’s level of physical activity. Ask whether he plays sports often and, if
so, what kind? For example, baseball pitchers
experience excessive movement in their throwing arms that can affect shoulder functions
(Petty and Moore 2002).
5. Ask about the client’s occupation. Does your
client work at a computer desk or at a manual
labor job? People who work at a computer all day
long tend to round their upper backs, protract
their shoulder girdles, and internally rotate
their arms as they type. Spending lots of time
in this posture will affect the alignment of the
thoracic spine, the shoulder girdle, and the rest
of the body (Price and Bratcher 2010).
6. Ask the client if shoulder and arm or midto-upper back pain ever prevents him from
engaging in an activity or limits what he can do.
This will highlight the activities he feels he is
missing out on, and why he is motivated to seek
your help (Price and Bratcher 2010).
7. Ask if the client’s pain is accompanied by any
other pains or symptoms. This will help the
client to understand the body’s interconnectedness, and it may help you to identify contributing issues or potential solutions. For example, a
client who has pain between his shoulder blades
after extensive computer work may find that
this pain coincides with pain in the back of his
neck. You can teach him how imbalances in the
upper back can affect the position of the neck
and head. (Learn how the thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle relate to all other areas of the
body later in this chapter). It will also prompt
you to take a closer look at the position of his
head and neck as you assess that area (Price
and Bratcher 2010).
8. Ask the client what aggravates the pain and
what makes it feel better (Petty and Moore
2002). If a client indicates, for instance, that
driving makes her neck pain worse, you can
coach her on improving her sitting and driving posture (see chapter 18, Static Postural
Considerations).

9. Ask the client if the pain ever wakes him up at
night or makes sleep difficult. For example, if a
client tells you that sleeping on his side makes his
shoulder or neck pain worse, you can coach him
on how to improve his sleeping posture (see chapter 18, Static Postural Considerations) to help
address this problem (Price and Bratcher 2010).
10. Ask the client if his pain increases with stress
or if he is currently under a lot of stress.
Chronic stress responses, such as shrugging
the shoulders and rounding the upper back,
can have a dramatic effect on the alignment of
the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle (Hanna
1988; Price 2015).
Once you have concluded the verbal portion of
the assessment process, move on to the visual and
hands-on assessments.

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENTS
When assessing the thoracic spine and shoulder
girdle, it is important to have a clear view of the
structures you are evaluating. Obviously, the assessment will be more accurate if there are fewer garments obstructing your view, but do not insist that
clients remove clothing or wear certain items, such
as tank tops, sports bras, or form-fitting shirts, if
this makes them feel uncomfortable in any way. You
can simply ask them to tuck their shirts into their
pants so you can more easily view the structures of
the torso and shoulders.

ASSESSMENT FOR EXCESSIVE
THORACIC KYPHOSIS
To evaluate whether a client has excessive thoracic
kyphosis, ask her to stand in front of you facing sideways. Place your fingers on the back of the client’s
neck and locate the vertebrae of her cervical spine.
Follow the curvature of the spine from the top of the
neck to the bottom, and feel each vertebra like the
keys of a piano. You will notice that the last vertebra
of the neck (C7) protrudes out slightly more than
the vertebrae directly above it, perhaps noticeably
so in the form of a dowager’s hump (see figure 5.2)
(Bontrager and Lampignano 2014).
If you are having difficulty locating C7, place your
fingers on the base of the client’s neck and instruct
him to look down at his feet and then back up above
his head. As he looks down and up, you will feel that
C7 does not move much compared to the vertebrae
above it (Kehr and Weidner 1987). Once you have
located C7, place the tip of your index finger on

43

this vertebra. Extend your index finger so that it is
straight and parallel to the ground (see figure 5.3a).
Now position the index finger of your other hand
with your finger straight and parallel to the ground
on the indentation on the front of the client’s torso
between the middle of the collarbones on the top of
the sternum (i.e., the jugular notch; see figure 5.3b).
When both fingers are in place, evaluate the difference
in height between your two fingers (see figure 5.3c).
When a person is in good alignment, your index
finger on the front of the client’s chest should be
about 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm) lower than your finger
positioned on the client’s neck since the anatomical
position of the spinous process (bony projection off
the back) of C7 is about 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm) higher
than the top of the sternum when the thoracic spine
is in proper alignment (Bontrager and Lampignano
2014). If your index finger on the front of the client’s
chest is more than 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm) lower than
your index finger on the neck, it is indicative that
the client has excessive thoracic kyphosis. This is
because the back of the rib cage attaches to the
thoracic spine, and when the thoracic spine rounds
forward, the sternum (where the front of the rib
cage attaches) drops down and forward. The greater

the difference in height (of more than 1-1/2 inches)
(3.8 cm) between your two fingers, the greater the
amount of excessive thoracic kyphosis.

EVALUATE THE POSITION OF THE
SHOULDER BLADES
When a person is standing with her arms at her sides
in good thoracic alignment, the shoulder blades
should rest relatively flat and down on the back
of the rib cage (Kendall, McCreary, and Provance
2005). You can visually and manually assess the

client’s shoulder blades to evaluate whether they
have moved up and away from their correct position,
which would denote a protracted shoulder girdle or
elevated shoulder blades.
Ask the client to stand facing away from you, and
look at the edges of her shoulder blades closest to the
spine. If one or both of the shoulder blades appear
to stick out away from the body, this indicates a
protracted shoulder girdle (see figure 5.4) (Bryant
and Green 2010).
To further assess if a client has a protracted
shoulder girdle, place your finger(s) on the border
of the scapula that is closest to the spine. Evaluate
whether the shoulder blades are lying flat to the
back of the rib cage. If either scapula sticks out (or
you can easily feel the border with your fingers),
then either one or both sides of the client’s shoulder
girdle are likely protracted (see figure 5.5) (Price
and Bratcher 2010).
Next, visually and manually assess the height of
each scapula. Use your fingers to feel for the top borders of the shoulder blades. Once you have found the
top borders, place the forefinger of each hand on this
part of the bone and look at your fingers to visually
assess the positioning of each scapula. Ideally, the
shoulder blades should be at the same height. Make
a note of any discrepancies between the shoulder
blades or if one appears to be higher than the other
one (see figure 5.6) (Rolf 1989).
You can also check to see if one or both shoulder
blades are elevated by assessing muscle tension in
this area (Petty and Moore 2002). Grasp the upper
trapezius muscle on the top of the client’s shoulder
with your thumb and forefinger. Feel the muscle
between your fingertips, and assess any differences
in tension between the two sides. Make a note if the
muscles in general feel excessively tight or have any

obvious knots (see figure 5.7) (Price and Bratcher
2010). If one or both sides have excessive tension,
you can safely assume that one or both shoulder
blades are elevated because the tight muscles attach
to the scapula.
The position of the shoulder blades may be
affected by the presence of scoliosis, depending on
the severity of the condition. However, since this
text covers only the most common deviations you
may encounter as a fitness professional, assessments
related to scoliosis will not be discussed.

EVALUATE THE POSITION OF THE
ACROMION
To further evaluate the position of the shoulder
girdle, ask the client to turn to the side. Note the
position of the acromion, the bony protuberance on
the top of the shoulder. Ideally, that bony landmark
should be in line with the tragus, the fleshy piece
of skin that covers up part of the opening at the

tension and elevated scapulae.

front of the ear (Johnson 2016). If the acromion is
farther forward than the tragus, it is an indication
that the client has a protracted shoulder girdle (see
figure 5.8).

EVALUATE THE POSITION OF THE
ARMS

Ask the client to let her arms hang by her sides
while she stands in a normal, relaxed state. Position yourself directly in front of her and look at her
hands. When a person is in proper alignment, the
hands and arms should have a slight internal rotation—they should turn in toward the midline of the
body about 15 degrees (Betts et al. 2013). If only the
thumbs, forefingers, and some of the middle fingers
are visible, then the arms are in correct alignment
(see figure 5.9).
However, if you can see all of the client’s fingers
and the backs of her hands, then her arms are considered to be excessively internally rotated (see figure
5.10) (Betts et al. 2013).
Go to the online video to watch video 5.2,
where Justin demonstrates the visual assessment for internally rotated arms.

TEACHING CLIENTS
NEUTRAL POSITION OF
THE THORACIC SPINE AND
SHOULDER GIRDLE

Once you have completed your assessment of the
shoulder blades and shoulder girdle, visually evaluate the position of the client’s arms. You can determine whether a client’s arms are rotated too far
internally by looking at the position of the fingers,
hands, and wrists (Johnson 2016).

As with the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, one of the keys
to correcting dysfunctions in the thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle is to teach clients how to achieve and

shoulder girdle.

Optimal alignment of the arms
when standing.


Assessing the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

maintain a neutral position for the thoracic spine,
shoulders, and arms when standing. You can coach
them using the following strategies.
Ask the client to stand against a wall and to pull
the thoracic spine upright until his shoulders touch
the wall. As he does this, have him retract his shoulder blades so that his arms rotate outward. Coach
him not to shrug his shoulders or arch his lower back
as he performs these movements with the torso,
shoulders, and arms (see figure 5.11). You can check
to see if he has “cheated,” using the lower back to
lift the torso, by sliding your hand into the space
between the lower back and the wall to check for
excessive lumbar lordosis (see chapter 4, Assessing
the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle). You should also coach
the client to avoid compensating in other ways, such
as by bending his knees or moving his feet or hips
away from the wall.
Achieving and maintaining a neutral standing
position for the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
will be difficult for most clients. However, encouraging them to try will help them to understand how far
they are from neutral and what muscles they must
activate to achieve it.
Before you move on to the verbal, visual, and
hands-on assessments for the neck and head, briefly
sum up your findings about the client’s thoracic
spine and shoulder girdle. Make sure you have com-

pleted the CAD for this area, and briefly describe
for the client how the thoracic spine and shoulder
girdle relate to the structures above and below them.

Figure 5.10 Example of internally rotated
arms.

Figure 5.11

HOW THE THORACIC
SPINE AND SHOULDER
GIRDLE RELATE TO ALL
OTHER AREAS OF THE
BODY
As the thoracic spine rounds forward and the
kyphotic curve increases, the lordotic curve in the
lumbar spine also tends to increase to help maintain balance (Kendall, McCreary, and Provance
2005). This causes the pelvis to rotate forward
and the leg to rotate internally, producing a valgus
knee displacement and overpronation of the foot
and ankle complex (see figure 5.12) (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
Excessive thoracic kyphosis is also accompanied
by a protracted shoulder girdle, elevated shoulder
blades, and internally rotated arms. These imbalances in the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
consequently affect the position of the neck and
head since the head is attached to the neck, which

is in turn attached to the thoracic spine (Palmer,
Epler, and Epler 1998). When the thoracic spine
and shoulders collapse, the head and neck follow
and fall forward also. As the head collapses down
and forward, the neck arches backward and upward
to maintain balance and to enable the eyes to focus
on the horizon (see figure 5.13) (Palmer, Epler, and
Epler 1998). Over time, this collapsing forward of
the head and overarching of the cervical spine can

place undue stress and strain on the structures of
the neck and upper back.
It is important that you understand these patterns of movement and teach your clients about how
problems in one part of the body produce compensations elsewhere. This will help both parties to better
understand movement patterns and positions that
may be exacerbating clients’ conditions or hampering their ability to perform effectively.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Review of Key Points
The thoracic spine and shoulder girdle comprises the middle and mid-upper part of the spine,
the rib cage, the shoulder girdle, and the arms. These structures are intrinsically involved
in nearly every movement the body makes, and they also protect vital organs, such as the
heart and lungs.
■■The four most common deviations found in the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle are

1. excessive thoracic kyphosis,
2. protracted shoulder girdle,
3. elevated scapula, and
4. internally rotated arms.
■■The thoracic spine naturally contains a slight kyphotic curve. However, an excessive

curvature in the thoracic region can cause compensatory movements in the lumbar and
cervical regions of the spine. Therefore, the lower back, hips, and neck are adversely
affected by excessive thoracic kyphosis.
■■It is important to learn the types and intensity of physical activity that a client typically

engages in so that you can understand how much stress she places on her shoulders,
arms, and upper back. This information, in addition to identifying which activities cause
or alleviate her pain, can help you determine which soft tissue structures may be irritated
or may need to be addressed in a corrective exercise program.
■■Chronic stress can affect the upper body as the thoracic spine rounds forward into a

protective or defensive posture. Asking clients about their stress levels can help you to
determine if stress might be affecting their musculoskeletal health.
■■Internally rotated arms and an elevated or protracted scapula can affect the function of

the shoulder girdle and arms, which can create problems for both exercise and activities
of daily living.
■■Record any pertinent information on the Client Assessment Diagram.

Self-Check
To help you feel how excessive thoracic kyphosis affects the functions of the thoracic spine
and shoulder girdle, perform the following movements. Try each movement first with your
upper back rounded into an excessively kyphotic position. Then correct your posture and
repeat the same movement. Note the quality and the range of motion you achieve when you
perform each movement in both the bad posture trial (A) and the good posture trial (B).

MOVEMENT 1
Trial A: Bad Posture
Round your upper back and shoulders. Try to lift your arms over your head and back toward
your ears while still keeping your upper back and shoulders rounded forward. Make a mental
note of how high you can lift your arms back to your ears.

Trial B: Good Posture
Now correct your posture in your thoracic spine and shoulder girdle and try to lift your arms
again. You will notice that your arms can go much higher and farther back to your ears when
your thoracic spine is upright in the correct position.


Assessing the Thoracic Spine and Shoulder Girdle

MOVEMENT 2
Trial A: Bad Posture
Round your upper back and shoulders. Try to rotate your torso to the right and then to the
left while still keeping your upper back and shoulders rounded forward. Make a mental note
of how far you can rotate to the right and to the left.

Trial B: Good Posture
Now correct your posture and try to rotate your torso to the right and then to the left again. You
will notice that you can rotate much farther when your thoracic spine is positioned correctly.

MOVEMENT 3
Trial A: Bad Posture
Round your upper back, stretch out your arms to your sides, and try to rotate your arms
outward and behind you so that the palms of your hands point to the ceiling. Be sure to
keep your upper back and shoulders rounded forward as you perform the movement. Make
a mental note of how far your arms and shoulders rotate back.

Trial B: Good Posture
Now correct the posture in your thoracic spine and try the same movement again. You will
notice that you can rotate your palms, arms, and hands much farther and pull your arms
back more easily when your thoracic spine is in correct alignment.
