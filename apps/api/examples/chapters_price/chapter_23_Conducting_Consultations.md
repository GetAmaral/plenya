## Chapter 23: Conducting Consultations

CHAPTER 23
Conducting Consultations
In chapter 22, you learned about the motivations
and psychological traits that can affect behavior as
you and your clients meet to address their musculoskeletal concerns. Understanding that your client
might view this experience very differently than you
do will encourage you to communicate as clearly as
possible at every stage of the consultation process.
Trying to understand your client’s perspective will
also help you to build trust, avoid mistakes, and
increase the likelihood that a prospect will sign up
to use your services.

FIRST CONTACT
As with any situation where two parties are involved,
there are always different ways of seeing, feeling,
communicating, and interpreting the first contact
with each other. The following section will explore
the elements of this interaction from a typical client’s perspective and then from yours. It will also
cover practical considerations and tips for success
during this initial contact so that the client will set
up an appointment and give you the opportunity to
perform a complete in-person assessment.

CLIENT’S PERSPECTIVE
When prospective clients first inquire into your services, it is likely they have tried and failed to improve
their conditions with the help of other health and
fitness professionals, especially if they have had the
problems for some time (Boyes 2015). Therefore,
while they may be hopeful, they may doubt that you
can help them. If they cannot participate in activi-

ties they enjoy because of pain or dysfunction, they
might fear that they will never be able to do them
again. Their anxiety may have been compounded
by misinformation they gathered online (Simpson,
Neria, Lewis-Fernández, and Schneier 2010).
Most potential clients will also be apprehensive
about meeting with you to discuss their situation.
You can begin to allay their fears by responding
to their initial inquiries by telephone rather than
by email or texting. Talking with a person, rather
than communicating electronically, helps a potential
client feel more comfortable about meeting you.

YOUR PERSPECTIVE
While a potential client will probably be anxious
about contacting you for assistance, your reaction
will probably be excitement that you may be getting
another customer. You may also feel nervous about
meeting a new person and persuading her to sign
up for your services. This combination of excitement and nervousness can sometimes make you do
things you would not normally do when speaking
with clients, like talking too much in an effort to
establish your worth, using technical jargon, or
making assumptions about her condition before you
have even met her (Donaldson 2007).
In order to quell your own anxieties when first
contacting a prospective client, keep the initial
conversation simple, and refrain from talking about
yourself too much. Once the person has summarized
her problem, suggest that she make an appointment
for a consultation so you can assess her and make an
informed decision about whether you can help her.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
FOR INITIAL CONTACT
There are many things to keep in mind so that
your initial contact with a client can be a positive
experience.

GATHERING ESSENTIAL
INFORMATION
During your initial conversation about an in-person
consultation, you must exchange certain basic
information:
■■Ask for (and record) the prospective client’s full
name, contact details, and general reason for
wanting to meet with you.
■■Discuss what the client can expect during the
consultation and assessment process and what
he should wear.
■■Provide your telephone number and clear directions on how to get your facility.
■■Confirm the time and date of the appointment
before ending the conversation.
■■Send a follow-up email containing the details of
the appointment and directions to the meeting
(Price and Bratcher 2010).

CHARGING FOR CONSULTATIONS
During your initial conversation, you should tell
the prospective client whether the consultation and
assessment session is complimentary or a paid service. If a person is coming to see you specifically for
help with a musculoskeletal issue, it may be best to
provide the initial consultation and assessment free
of charge. Otherwise, a prospective client who has
had unsuccessful experiences with other health and

fitness professionals may think that you, too, are just
out to take his money. However, if you are willing to
take the time to speak to him on the telephone and
then conduct a full, complimentary verbal, visual,
and hands-on assessment, he will be more likely to
trust you and your skills. As your reputation in the
field of corrective exercise grows, you will receive
more referrals. At that point, you may decide to
start charging for consultations since most of your
referrals will come from sources the potential client
trusts, such as friends, family members, a peer, or
a work colleague, and there will be less need for
persuasion (Bly 1991).

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
PROCESS
The following section will explore the elements of
the verbal portion of the in-person consultation and
assessment process from a typical client’s perspective and then from your perspective. It will also cover
practical considerations and tips for success during
the verbal assessment.

CLIENT’S PERSPECTIVE
When a prospective client arrives for her appointment with you, she might expect to be greeted by a
receptionist. While this type of setup may provide
a professional air (and be more convenient for you),
having to interact with another stranger upon arrival
often adds to the client’s nervousness. Therefore,
whenever possible, greet the prospective client
yourself when she arrives. This allows you to introduce yourself, and it makes her feel more relaxed
(since she will recognize you from having spoken
on the phone). If you are busy working with another

First Contact: Keys to Success
• It is not uncommon for potential

clients to ask you to venture a guess
about their particular musculoskeletal
issue over the telephone or before
you have performed a complete inperson structural assessment. Never do
this—it is unwise, unprofessional, and
potentially sets you up for failure if your
assumptions are incorrect.

• If possible, avoid discussing fees until

after the initial consultation so you can
demonstrate your skills and establish
the value of your program first.

Obviously, if you are asked directly for
a schedule of fees, it is appropriate to
state your rates.

• Keep the first contact on the telephone
brief and professional because it will
convey that you are a valued expert
whose time is respected.

• If a prospective customer was referred

to you by a current client, you may
acknowledge that you know that client.
However, never discuss the details of the
referring party’s problems or program.


Conducting Consultations

client when the new person arrives, you should still
acknowledge her presence and let her know that you
will be with her shortly (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Personally acknowledging prospective clients on
arrival also helps to cultivate a more positive attitude
about the consultation.
Prospective clients may assume that they will be
asked to complete some lengthy paperwork and then
told to sit and wait. This can be frustrating, especially
for someone whose musculoskeletal pain makes it
uncomfortable to sit for prolonged periods. While
some paperwork may be needed before the consultation begins, limit this to a short intake form that asks
for the client’s basic information. You can gather more
detailed information about their condition and their
history during the verbal consultation, and again
when they agree to sign up for your services. Showing consideration by limiting the initial paperwork
conveys empathy, and this positive feeling will carry
over into the assessment process (Price 2012).
Once the verbal consultation begins, the potential
client will experience many emotions, and these may
be expressed in various ways. Typically, an anxious
client will
■■feel nervous or self-conscious that his body and

lifestyle are being scrutinized,
■■be reluctant to speak and to share pertinent

information,
■■talk nonstop or speak very quickly, making it
difficult for you to glean important data, and
■■give nonverbal indications of nervousness such
as crossing his arms or legs, fidgeting, looking
away, or turning his body away (Griffin 2006).
Being aware of these clues can help you to detect
when a person is feeling uneasy and should prompt
you to change your own behavior to make the
experience more positive and less stressful for the
prospective client.

YOUR PERSPECTIVE
While a prospective client may be expected to feel
nervous during the in-person consultation, you may
also feel apprehensive about the meeting. If a prospective client arrives very early for the consultation
and you are with another client, for example, you
may get anxious about the new person watching
you work. As a result, you may interact differently
with the client you are currently helping. Be aware
of your own tendencies when you are nervous, and
refocus on the task at hand. This will result in a
better experience for everyone.
On the other hand, if a prospective client is late

for an appointment, you may worry that you will not
be able to finish the assessment and consultation
before your next scheduled client arrives. In that
case you can tell the prospective client when she
arrives that you have another appointment directly
after hers. This will enable you to adjust your meeting strategy and let the client know when to expect
the consultation to end (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Occasionally, your own experiences and biases
may surface upon meeting a new client face-toface. This can affect the way you interact with that
person (Sternberg, Roediger, and Halpern 2007). For
example, if you have little empathy for extremely
overweight people, you may not be sympathetic
when an obese person tells you about his musculoskeletal discomfort. Alternatively, you might make
assumptions based on clothing or appearances about
whether a person can afford your rates. Every potential client deserves your full respect and attention.
It is your responsibility to be aware of your own
preconceptions so they do not affect the way you
communicate with prospective clients.

PRACTICAL
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE
VERBAL ASSESSMENT
There are many aspects of the verbal assessment
that must be taken into account to ensure a smooth
and productive experience.

CONSULTATION AREAS
During the verbal assessment you will discuss a
variety of topics, some of which may be personal. It
is essential to use a quiet place to conduct this part
of the consultation so the client can feel comfortable
answering your questions. If possible, arrange the
consultation space in a way that signifies that you
and the client are equals; move your chair around
from behind your desk, or choose a couch or bench
where you both can sit together (Griffin 2006).

RAPPORT BUILDING
Establishing rapport quickly with a prospect will
increase the likelihood that the verbal assessment
will go well.
■■Make direct eye contact, and make sure that

your body language, tone of voice, and spoken
words are in harmony. If your words are positive,
but your body language is closed off or you avoid
eye contact when speaking, potential clients
will get mixed messages that may erode your
credibility (Griffin 2006).

351


352

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

■■Begin the consultation with an open-ended

question, such as, “How can I help you?” Openended questions let clients answer in a way that
is comfortable for them, enabling them to control
the opening subject matter.
■■As the person gains confidence during the discussion, begin to ask closed-ended questions,
such as, “Do you have pain in your feet?” in
order to get more specific information (Friesen
2010).

GUIDING THE CONVERSATION
When you ask an open-ended question at the beginning of the assessment, the client may tell you about
discomfort she has in a certain part of her body, such as
her lower back. Once you have talked about this issue,
use the Client Assessment Diagram (CAD) to steer the
conversation toward the topics you need to complete
the evaluation (Price and Bratcher 2010). For example,
you can guide the conversation by asking, “Have you
ever experienced other pains in your body such as
your knees?” Even if the prospective client does not
mention previous or current pains, it is necessary to
ask about pain and function for every part of the body.
Doing so may remind her of past incidents, such as
broken bones, surgeries, or accidents, that can affect
the success of her program (Petty and Moore 2002).

As the assessment continues, the prospective
client may reveal that someone she knows had similar issues that required drastic measures to resolve,
such as a friend who had a hip replacement. Address
these anxieties head-on by reminding her that you
will be performing a thorough physical evaluation
of her entire body following the verbal assessment,
and you will be offering corrective exercise solutions.
Acknowledging clients’ concerns in this manner
keeps the verbal assessment going while also helping turn their fears into hope for the future (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

CONTEMPLATING SOLUTIONS
AND GAUGING COMMITMENT
During the verbal assessment, you will ask about
any activities or exercises the person is currently
using to try to deal with their limitations or their
pain. This type of information will help you gauge
whether the client has already created some form
of disciplined approach and time commitment
to resolving the problem. It will also provide you
with an opportunity to evaluate the client’s prior
experience(s) with other health and fitness professionals and whether she is genuinely ready to
participate in a corrective exercise program (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

Verbal Assessment: Keys to Success
• If clients must wait before the

assessment begins, make sure they feel
comfortable in the interim by offering
them water and directions to the rest
rooms or changing facilities.

• Using technical jargon or talking

too much can make a client feel
overwhelmed. Be conscious of this as
you conduct the assessment (Donaldson
2007).

• Refrain from getting too personal

when asking questions during the
verbal assessment. Gather pertinent
information about the client’s
musculoskeletal and health issues
without delving into their private lives
(Price and Bratcher 2010).

• Belittling the past efforts of clients who
have used the services of professionals
whose methods you disagree with, or

who have had unnecessary surgeries,
will only make them feel foolish (Price
and Bratcher 2010). Always applaud
their efforts to find solutions.

• If a prospective client highlights a

specific place on his body that is painful
and wants you to examine it during the
verbal consultation, stay on track with
the verbal assessment process, but use
that opportunity to inform him of what
will take place in the visual and handson assessments to follow.

• The verbal assessment is only one part

of the assessment process. Complete
the entire assessment process (including
the visual and hands-on portions),
gathering all the necessary clues before
making a decision about a client’s
musculoskeletal issues.


Conducting Consultations

STRESS AND MUSCLE TENSION
Since mental pressures often manifest as muscular
tension, stress is another matter that should factor
into your verbal assessment conversation. While it
is not necessary (or appropriate) for you to inquire
about the specific cause of a client’s stress, it is your
job to educate people about how stress can affect
their musculoskeletal health. To stay within your
scope of practice, simply ask prospective clients
if they find aspects of their work, relationships, or
home life to be stressful. If the answer is yes, you
can talk about some exercise strategies, such as
self-massage techniques, to help negate the physical
effects of stress (Price 2015).

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Once you have completed the verbal assessment, you
will commence the visual and hands-on assessment
process. As with the verbal assessment, we will
examine two perspectives on this experience—the
client’s and your own.

CLIENT’S PERSPECTIVE
Upon completion of the verbal assessment, most
prospective clients believe that their mental involvement in the assessment process is over. This impression may result from past consultation experiences
when they answered some initial health questions
and then relaxed and waited for the professional to
examine them, diagnose the problem, and offer up
the recommended treatment. Although common,
this approach to assessment reinforces clients’
lack of self-confidence by making them think their
involvement is not important. As you now know,
in order for your clients to succeed, they need to
take responsibility for the desired outcome (Reeve
2015). Therefore, the visual and hands-on assessment process requires as much, if not more, client
participation than the verbal assessment.
Once clients realize that they will be actively
involved in the visual and hands-on evaluation, they
will likely feel a rush of self-consciousness. You can
minimize their anxiety by
■■keeping them focused on the process,
■■avoiding

comments about their aesthetic
appearance or apparel, and
■■limiting remarks about any physical abnormalities you observe.

It is also important to bear in mind that if a client
does have a physical deviation, he may try to brush
over that area of his body when it is being assessed.
This is particularly common when it comes to physical characteristics such as bunions or calluses. For
example, when you note a person’s bunions during
the visual and hands-on assessment for the feet and
begin to ask questions, many clients will casually
remark that the bunions have been there for a long
time and do not really hurt at all. In fact, they may
be excruciating or extremely embarrassing. The
only way to gauge how clients truly feel about an
unusual physical trait is to pay attention to their
body language in addition to what they say during
the assessment (Griffin 2006).

YOUR PERSPECTIVE
The visual and hands-on assessment process enables
you to uncover the cause of a client’s pain or dysfunction, and it gives you an opportunity to demonstrate
your skills. However, this part of the assessment
process is also where your anxieties may take over
as you try to show the person how much you know.
Remember that extraneous information will only
detract from the effectiveness of the assessments.
Focus on conducting the assessments and conveying the findings in a practical way that makes sense
to the client.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
To ensure a smooth and productive experience at
this stage of the consultation, bear in mind the following points.

MAKE CONNECTIONS
Before commencing the visual and hands-on assessments, explain to the prospective client what you
will be doing. People will feel more comfortable
when they know what to expect (Shah and Gardner
2008). Refer to the Client Assessment Diagram for
guidance until you are completely familiar with
the visual and hands-on assessments you need to
perform and in what order.
Talk the client through each assessment as you
perform it, and link each assessment to the next
area of the body. For example, if you have assessed a
person’s feet and ankles and found that they overpronate, explain how overpronation affects the function
of her knees. Although this kind of information may
seem simple to you, it may be the first time she has
ever been made aware of the functional relationship
between her feet and her knees. Helping clients to

353

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

understand these links reassures them that their
bodies are not broken—they are simply reacting to
imbalances elsewhere (Price and Bratcher 2010).

USE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE
For clients to meaningfully participate in the assessment process with you, you must convey crucial
technical information so a layperson can understand
it (Donaldson 2007). Here are suggestions on how to
phrase technical assessment information in clientfriendly ways:

Technical term
Overpronation
Excessive lumbar
lordosis
Excessive thoracic
kyphosis
Excessive cervical
lordosis
Valgus knee
Anterior rotation
Tibia and fibula
Femur
Acetabulum
Lumbar spine
Thoracic spine
Cervical spine
Glenohumeral joint
Scapula

Client-friendly term
Flattening of the foot
Too much arch in thelower back
Rounded shoulders
Too much arch in the neck
Moved toward the middle
Front of pelvis has tipped
down
Lower leg
Upper leg or thigh bone
Hip socket
Lower back
Mid- to upper back
Neck
Shoulder joint
Shoulder blade

ACCOMMODATING LEARNING
STYLES
In addition to the language you use, another part of
engaging someone in the assessment process is to
integrate their style of learning into the proceedings. Once the visual and hands-on assessment is
underway, tune in to whether the prospective client
learns most effectively by watching (visual learning
style), listening (verbal learning style), or doing (kinesthetic learning style) (Winnick and Porretta 2017).
Some people might learn using a combination of all
three styles. Generally, a person will use descriptive
words that match his learning style.
■■A verbal learner might respond to your expla-

nations with statements such as, “I hear what
you are saying” or “That doesn’t sound good!”
Verbal learners benefit from detailed and clear
instructions that enable them to focus on the

words being used versus the actions being performed (Winnick and Porretta 2017).
■■Visual learners might respond to your instructions with statements such as, “I see what you’re
saying” or “That didn’t look good!” This type of
learner would benefit most from observing the
assessments as you conduct them (e.g., watching you perform them in a mirror so they can
see the results for themselves) (Winnick and
Porretta 2017).
■■Kinesthetic learners might respond to something you have said with a statement such as,
“I really feel that when my foot collapses,” or “I
can also sense what happens to my knee when
my foot flattens.” Kinesthetic learners need to
physically experience what their particular
imbalances feel like. You can help them achieve
this by coaching them to place their own hands
on parts of their bodies as you perform each
assessment (Winnick and Porretta 2017).

MAXIMIZING ASSESSMENT IMPACT
Teaching prospective clients how to perform some
of the structural assessments you use is a great
way to maximize their participation in the process
(Price and Bratcher 2010). Also, if they know how
to perform assessments on their own, then they will
be able to monitor their own progress after their
programs begin. Furthermore, if prospective clients
learn to perform some of the assessments during the
consultation, they may try them on friends or family
members. This can spark interest in your corrective exercise services from other people and lead
to promising referrals (Price and Bratcher 2010).
While you might mention one or two exercise
solutions as you perform the assessments, do not
provide too much exercise information during the
assessment process. A good rule of thumb is that
once you get an indication that the prospective client
is buying into the program (and excited about the
exercises he will learn), do not discuss any more
sample solutions. Leave clients feeling eager for
more at the end of the assessment process because
this will prompt them to sign up for the program
(Price 2012).

CONCLUDING THE ASSESSMENT
PROCESS
When you are ready to bring the consultation to a
close, return to a quiet place and summarize your
findings from the structural assessment. Ending
the consultation in a private area enables you to
hold the client’s attention while you explain your


Conducting Consultations

findings. It also gives you a much more appropriate
place to discuss the issue of money (Griffin 2006).
Following is an example of how to summarize the
assessment process:
Mr. Stone, based on the assessment findings,
we discovered that both of your feet flatten out
more than they should. This is probably caused
by the fact that your shoulders are rounded
forward, which is causing your body to fall
forward of its center of gravity and to place
more stress on your feet. The rounding of your
shoulders forward also makes you have to arch
the back of your neck excessively to keep your
eyes aligned with the horizon. This musculoskeletal imbalance in your upper back is what
is making both your neck and your feet hurt.

CLOSING THE DEAL
The last part of the consultation process involves
providing program information that will lead to the
person signing up for your services (Crane 2013).
This section will discuss each party’s perspective
with regard to closing the deal and will cover practical considerations and tips for success during this
final stage.

CLIENT’S PERSPECTIVE
When the assessment process is over, the prospective client will typically want to know:
■■How much do your corrective exercise services
cost?
■■How many sessions will it take to reach my
goals?
■■How often do I need to see you?

People may also have special circumstances that
are of concern to them. For example, prospective
clients who travel often will want to know if they
will be able to move forward with their corrective
exercise programs when they are away from home.
Others may have to travel a long way to see you and,
therefore, may find it difficult to attend sessions on
a regular basis. In special circumstances such as
these, be prepared to provide alternate program
suggestions and to help these people set realistic
goals about what to expect from a modified program
(Price and Bratcher 2010).
While some of the questions asked during the
consultation wrap-up are legitimate, often they are
indications of last-minute pangs of insecurity. This
is natural behavior for anyone who is deciding to
pledge substantial time and money to a new course
of action. However, if you listen to the prospective
clients’ concerns and address each question in a
logical and empathetic manner, their fears will be
lessened, and they will feel more confident about
deciding to use your services (Bandura 1986).

YOUR PERSPECTIVE
By now you should be more self-assured when it
comes to your structural assessment and corrective
exercise skills. However, you may be less confident,
or even intimidated, by the act of selling your products and services. While this is a common challenge
for many personal service providers, you must work
on strengthening your sales abilities. If you appear
nervous when discussing program variables, duration, or costs, prospective clients may misinterpret
this as dishonesty, weakening their confidence in
you and your programs. Therefore, it is important
for you to navigate this final portion of the consultation process confidently (Bly 1991). Remember that

Visual and Hands-On Assessment: Keys to Success
• Nervous clients may try to divert your

attention during the assessment process
by talking about different topics or
showing you exercises they have done
in the past. Note their anxieties and
listen to their concerns, but stick to the
step-by-step nature of the assessment
process (Price and Bratcher 2010).

• Some clients will make flattering

comments during the assessment
process that classify you as an authority
figure. Always bring the tone of the

assessment back to you as a facilitator,
not the authority (Schwarz 2017).

• The assessment process is

psychologically taxing for clients. Keep
the consultation to an hour or less by
sticking to your assessment plan and
following the assessment protocols.

• Never diagnose a medical condition or

provide an opinion about a medical issue.
This is completely beyond the scope
of practice of most health and fitness
professionals (Bryant and Green 2010).

355

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

selling the program to a potential client is no different from any other part of the consultation process.
You simply follow a structured and well-practiced
routine to ensure that you cover all the important
sales and transaction details.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
FOR CLOSING THE
CONSULTATION
Following are some vital elements for bringing your
consultation wrap-up to a successful close.

OUTLINING THE PROPOSED
PROGRAM
Once you have summarized your assessment findings and plan of action, explain that The BioMechanics Method corrective exercise programs are
comprised of three phases that are designed to help
the body adapt to the musculoskeletal changes you
will be making together: self-myofascial release (or
self-massage), stretching, and strengthening exercises. Explain that these phases will be introduced
in that order, and then briefly describe each one
so the client understands the rationale (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
Self-myofascial release and self-massage could be
explained as follows:
Self-massage is akin to chewing gum before
you blow a bubble. You have to work the gum
first in order to make it soft and flexible,
otherwise it will tear when you try to blow
the bubble. Think of your muscles the same
way. Your imbalances have created some
inflexible areas in your muscles and soft
tissues. If we start off with exercises that try
to move your body into increased ranges of
motion without first loosening up the tissues,
we might hurt something. That’s why I will
teach you the self-massage component first so
your body loosens up before we begin asking
it to perform greater ranges of movement like
stretching.
The stretching component could then be summarized as follows:
Once you have loosened up your muscles and
soft tissues with the self-massage exercises, we
can focus on moving those muscles and joints

that have not been working correctly. This
is done through various types of stretching.
Finally, explain the strengthening component of
the program:
When your muscles and joints can move
more effectively, we will start adding exercises that will help your body get stronger
so you can eliminate your imbalances and
maintain better alignment. As you progress
with the strengthening exercises, they will
become more integrated, meaning that your
whole body will be working together like
what happens in real life. For example, I’ll
be teaching you exercises that will help you
to walk without pain or to play tennis or golf
better (if these are two sports that clients have
indicated that they enjoy).
Providing a succinct overview of the proposed
program also helps a client understand that corrective exercise is a process that requires time and
perseverance (Simpson 2011).

GIVING SPECIFIC EXAMPLES
After the program overview, give one specific example of a corrective exercise and illustrate how this
particular strategy will address the person’s current
musculoskeletal issue(s) if needed. For example, you
might explain what a foam roller is and how you will
teach the client to use it to massage the muscles of
her upper back to address her rounded shoulder
posture and alleviate her shoulder and neck pain.
If appropriate, also share one or two nonexerciserelated tactics, such as changing shoe types or
adjusting sleeping posture, that will be included as
part of the corrective exercise program. Highlighting
small, nonexercise-related changes will make the
corrective exercise process appear easy to implement
and will build the client’s confidence (Price 2012).

DESCRIBING A TYPICAL SESSION
Once a prospective client has learned about the
general components of the program, describe what
may happen during a typical session.
■■State how long each session will last and, if you

are integrating corrective strategies into other
exercise programs like sport-specific training,
how much time you will spend per session learning, progressing, and regressing the corrective
exercises.


Conducting Consultations

■■Advise clients that they will be required to per-

form homework exercises outside of the times
you meet together. Further explain that you will
take a picture of each exercise you recommend
and provide written instructions for how to perform it (Simpson 2011). More information on how
to present a client’s homework in a professional
format is provided in chapter 25.
■■Explain that each session will begin with a
review of the exercises the client has been
working on and then adjusted based on his
progress.

ESTIMATING PROGRAM
DURATION AND FREQUENCY
Most people want to know how long they will need to
perform the corrective exercises and how long their
corrective exercise program will last. The answers to
these questions will depend largely on how much time
and effort they are willing to commit. The importance
of getting clients to tell you how much time they have
available, rather than you telling them how much time
they must commit, cannot be understated.
To help clients determine how long it will take
to reach their corrective exercise goals, ask them
how much time they are prepared to commit to
their homework exercises. If they tell you they can
spend 20 minutes a day, then the homework program
you design should be no longer than 20 minutes.
Getting clients to identify their desired homework
session length gets them involved in the process and

makes them responsible for finding the time each
day to do the work. If instead you tell them how
much time they must commit, they will blame you
if they cannot set aside the necessary time (Price
and Bratcher 2010).
The subject of how many corrective exercise sessions you think clients will need should be addressed
in conjunction with the discussion of how much
time they can commit to the homework exercises.
If they say they can only commit 5 to 10 minutes a
day, explain that it might take longer than average
for them to reach their goals. If they can spend more
time each day on their homework exercises, they will
reach their objectives more quickly.

DISCUSSING PROGRAM COSTS
The assessment and consultation process is carefully designed to make a prospective client recognize your specialty skills. Consequently, most
people will expect that your program rates reflect
the expert services you offer (Bly 1991). Whether
you offer single sessions, session packages, or a
combination of sessions and packages, confidently
convey what your prices are for each possibility
and inform clients of their payment options. It is
advantageous to provide several payment choices,
including cash, checks, direct deposit, and credit
cards. This will give clients more flexibility to invest
in their programs and will ensure that you have the
opportunity to help them realize their goals (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

Closing the Deal: Keys to Success
• Extraneous talk or additional

information about other products or
services you offer will hinder your
ability to sell your corrective exercise
programs. Aim to retain the positive
feelings about the assessment and
consultation to close the deal (Swain
and Brawner 2014).

• A prospective client’s enthusiasm can

be contagious, but avoid going into
too much program detail during the
consultation close. Offer only a couple
of examples of what the program
entails, and keep those examples brief.

• If clients are not prepared to put in

the necessary work to achieve their

goals, help them to develop realistic
expectations about your programs or
services.

• Although it can sometimes be beneficial

for you to allow a bit of flexibility with
regard to program costs or duration
when closing the consultation, do not let
a potential client regulate your fees or
your area of expertise (Price 2012).

• Trying to get an eager client to sign up

for as many sessions as possible in order
to boost your income can be tempting.
However, it is your responsibility to
help every client to succeed in the most
efficient manner possible.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Review of Key Points
The assessment and consultation process is used to sell your corrective exercise services and
to set up the right kind of relationship with prospective clients. When performed well, it can
alleviate client anxieties, increase potential adherence, and accurately shape expectations
about the program.
■■Whenever possible, speak with prospective clients on the telephone (as opposed to com-

municating via text or email) before meeting them in person.
■■Ask open-ended questions at the beginning of the in-person consultation to enable the

client to guide the initial stages of the conversation. As the consultation progresses,
ask closed-ended questions, such as those detailed on the Client Assessment Diagram
(CAD), to gather specific information about the client’s health history and musculoskeletal condition.
■■As you conduct the visual and hands-on assessments, use jargon-free language, and

employ verbal, visual, and kinesthetic teaching methodologies to ensure that potential
clients can follow along and participate.
■■Summarize your results at the end of the assessment process, answer any questions the

prospective client may have about their musculoskeletal health, and briefly discuss the
general components of The BioMechanics Method corrective exercise programs.
■■Always ask potential clients how much time they are prepared to dedicate to their home-

work each day rather than telling them how much you expect of them.
■■Be direct and confident when discussing money and providing information on estimated

program costs and payment options.

Self Check 1
It is important to practice the visual and hands-on assessment portion of the initial consultation often. Ask a friend or family member to allow you to perform the visual and hands-on
assessment process, and record your results on a copy of the CAD provided in the appendix.
When you are finished, use the following questions to elicit feedback on the person’s consultation experience.
1. What would you like to have known to help you feel more comfortable before we began
the visual and hands-on assessments?
2. Did you understand each of the assessments as we went through them and the explanations of how your imbalances might be causing your aches and pains? If not, what
was confusing?
3. What could I have done better during the assessment process from a teaching standpoint?
4. Did you feel like you were contributing to the assessment process? If so, how?
5. If not, are you referring to the whole process or a specific part?
6. Is there anything I could have done differently to help you feel more comfortable during
the assessment process?


Conducting Consultations

Self-Check 2
In order to practice your consultation wrap-up and sales skills, ask your subject from SelfCheck 1 to give you 10 minutes to try to sell him on the program of corrective exercise you
propose. Use the following chart to guide you through this process. After completing the
items in the left column, ask him for specific feedback on how you did and what you could
have done differently to improve the experience. Record his responses in the right column.
Points to cover
Summarize the results of the assessment.

Describe how the program is structured.

Give one or two examples of exercises or techniques you
plan to incorporate into his program to help him alleviate his
issues.

Describe how a session is structured.

Ask whether the person is prepared to do homework and
how often.

Outline the number of sessions recommended and the
frequency of visits.

Discuss the program cost and payment options.
