CHAPTER 13
Fascia
Fascia is a type of connective tissue that intertwines
and binds every muscle, organ, and soft tissue
structure throughout the body. It links the body
together as an integrated system of functional parts.
Therefore, when musculoskeletal imbalances occur
anywhere in the body, the whole system is affected
because of the interconnections created by this
fascial network (Myers 2008; Rolf 1989).
There are two levels of fascia in the body. The
first level is called the superficial fascia. It lies near
the surface of the body and helps bind our skin to
the muscles and other structures underneath. The
second layer is called deep fascia. It helps bind
together different layers of a muscle and also helps
hold our nerves, blood vessels, and organs in place
(Myers 2008; Rolf 1989).
To help you visualize fascia in the body, imagine
a time when you tried to take the skin off a chicken
or turkey leg. The skin was attached by a thin film to
the muscle underneath. That tissue was the superficial fascia. When you tried to remove the meat from
the drumstick, you would have noticed another thin
membrane that wrapped around bunches of muscle
fibers and then to the bone. That membrane was the
deep fascia.
Fascia has elastic properties that help the body
deal with gravity and ground reaction forces by
absorbing and redistributing shock (Karageanes
2003). When the musculoskeletal system is functioning well, fascia is pliable and lengthens like a bungee
cord during movement to help reduce stress. On the
other hand, musculoskeletal imbalances, injuries,
myofascial restrictions (e.g., trigger points, adhesions, scar tissue), pain, and inflammation can inhibit
fascia’s ability to moderate tension (Houglum 2016).

Fascia is arranged in a series of systems that
follow the paths of muscles, bones, ligaments, and
tendons as they travel up, down, and around the
body, resulting in an inseparable link between the
musculoskeletal system and the fascia. Fascial systems that specifically surround muscles are called
myofascial networks. The purpose of these myofascial networks is to help the body to move forward
and backward, side-to-side, and in rotation—that
is, in all three planes of motion. However, musculoskeletal imbalances can disrupt these myofascial
systems, causing more dysfunction and pain, both
at the site of the imbalance and elsewhere in the
body (Myers 2008; Rolf 1989; Price and Bratcher
2010).
Understanding fascia’s influence on the entire
body will help you to appreciate that, while individual parts can experience pain and dysfunction,
the long-term remedy for musculoskeletal imbalances is to improve the functioning of the body as a
whole (Price and Bratcher 2010).

FASCIAL SYSTEMS FOR
FLEXION AND EXTENSION
Many movements made throughout the day require
the body to flex and extend. For example, when
you bend forward at the hips and round your spine
to pick something up off the ground, you must then
extend your hips and spine to stand up straight
again. You learned in previous chapters that muscles
and other soft tissue structures can both help initiate
these movements and help decelerate the transfer
of forces.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

There are three systems, or chains, of fascia that
link the muscles and their accompanying soft tissue
structures on the front and back of the body: the
superficial back line, the superficial front line, and
the deep front line (see figure 13.1).
Traveling down the body from top to bottom,
the superficial front line includes the sternocleidomastoid, rectus abdominis, quadriceps,
and tibialis anterior.
■ The deep front line includes the longus colli and
longus capitis, the diaphragm, the hip flexors,
the adductors, and the tibialis posterior.
■ The superficial back line includes the erector
spinae, sacrotuberous ligament, hamstrings,
gastrocnemius, and plantar fascia.
■

All of these systems of fascia help to synchronize
the movement of these muscles, predominantly in the
sagittal plane (i.e., movements that require the body to
either bend forward or arch backward) (Myers 2008).
When these myofascial systems are functioning
effectively, they ensure that all the musculoskeletal
structures of these systems work together to integrate and coordinate movements. In doing so, they
also protect individual parts of the body and the
rest of the kinetic chain from unnecessary stress
(Starlanyl and Sharkey 2013).

Many of the most common musculoskeletal imbalances affect the health and function of these myofascial systems responsible for flexion and extension.
Excessive lumbar lordosis and excessive cervical
lordosis, for example, can cause tension and restrict
mobility of the fascia on both the lower back and the
back of the neck and head (Hyde and Gengenbach
2007). Consequently, when the spine has to flex,
other parts of the spine, such as the thoracic spine,
must compensate for the lack of movement in the
lower back and neck. Over time, these repeated
compensation patterns can lead to the development
of additional musculoskeletal imbalances, such as
excessive thoracic kyphosis (DiGiovanna, Schiowitz,
and Dowling 2005).

FASCIAL SYSTEMS FOR
LATERAL MOVEMENT
In addition to sagittal plane movements, many daily
activities and sports require side-to-side (frontal
plane) movements. Walking, for example, involves
transferring weight from side to side and requires

that the pelvis shift from left to right, that the legs
and hips abduct and adduct, and that the spine flex
from one side to the other.
Many muscles and other soft tissue structures
help produce sideways movement and slow the transfer of forces as our body moves laterally. The musculoskeletal elements involved in these movements
are all part of the lateral line of fascia, a myofascial
system that connects the structures that run along
the sides of the body and facilitate movement in
the frontal plane (Myers 2008). There is a left and
a right lateral line; each line starts under the foot,
and it connects with the peroneal muscles as it wraps
around the outside of the ankle and up the side of the
lower leg. It then integrates with the iliotibial band
running up the outside of the thigh and into the
tensor fasciae latae and gluteus maximus muscles. It
then continues up the side of the torso by way of the
obliques and the intercostals, where it terminates on
the side of the neck (see figure 13.2) (Myers 2008).
Many of the most common musculoskeletal imbalances also affect the health and function of the myofascial systems that lie on sides of the body (Houglum 2016; Price and Bratcher 2010). For example,
overpronation causes the foot and ankle to collapse
inward. Over time, this imbalance can restrict foot
and ankle movement, causing other areas of the
body to compensate, like the knee deviating too far
toward the midline into a valgus position (Hutson
and Ward 2016).

FASCIAL SYSTEMS FOR
ROTATIONAL MOVEMENT
In addition to forward, backward, and sideways
motion, the body also performs movements that
require rotation (i.e., movements in the transverse
plane). Activities such as swinging the arms and
turning the torso when walking, taking a backswing
and following through in golf, and hitting a forehand
in tennis all involve rotation. The musculoskeletal
elements involved in transverse plane movements
are part of myofascial networks called spiral lines
that wrap around the body (Myers and Earls 2017).
There are two spiral lines running from head to
toe that also wrap around the body from front to
back (see figure 13.3). They begin under the foot and
wrap around the inside or the outside of the ankle,
travel up the front and side of the lower leg by way
of the tibialis anterior and peroneals, connect with
the side and back of the thigh via the iliotibial band
and biceps femoris muscle, continue up the spine by
way of the erector spinae muscles, and wrap around
the torso and rib cage by means of the obliques and

serratus anterior muscles. The system then crosses
over the back of the upper torso by way of the rhomboids and terminates at the base of the skull (Myers
2008). These spiral systems of fascia connect all of
the soft tissue structures that help rotate the body
as an integrated and coordinated chain.
A number of common musculoskeletal imbalances
affect the health and function of the myofascial
networks that wrap around the body (Houglum
2016; Price and Bratcher 2010). For example, when
a person is walking, protraction and retraction of the
shoulder blades helps the body to remain balanced
as the arms swing in opposition to the legs. However,
excessive protraction of the shoulder blade causes it
to move too far forward on the rib cage (and the arm
to internally rotate disproportionately). Over time,
this can irritate the fascia surrounding the shoulder
blades and affect the ability of the rhomboid muscles
to contract and lengthen appropriately. This in turn
affects the arm swing in relation to the opposite leg
swing, causing that leg, knee, and ankle to compensate by moving too far toward the midline during
gait (i.e., a valgus knee position and overpronation)
(Giangarra and Manske 2011).

FASCIAL SYSTEMS AND
COMPLEX MOVEMENT
Myofascial systems are not limited to helping people
to move either forward, backward, sideways, or in
rotation. Integrated real-life movements require
the body to move in multiple directions at the same
time (Myers 2008; Price and Bratcher 2010). When
we run or walk, for example, we move forward, sideto-side, and in rotation simultaneously. The legs are
swinging forward and backward (flexion and extension) as they roll inward and outward (internal and
external rotation). The spine is moving from side to
side as weight is transferred from left to right, and
it is also rotating with the arm swing (Swinnen et
al. 1994). These multiplanar movements are possible because, like the musculoskeletal system, the

body’s myofascial systems are interconnected. In
fact, many of the muscles and soft tissue structures
of one myofascial network are also contained in
others. The obliques, for instance, are part of both
the lateral and spiral lines, and the erector spinae
group is part of both the superficial back line and the
spiral line. The coordination of these complex myofascial networks facilitates sophisticated movement
in multiple planes during weight-bearing activities
(Myers 2008).
Having an understanding of fascia and how it can
affect the movement of the whole body is important
to your future success as you help people who have
musculoskeletal imbalances. You must consider the
myofascial systems as you begin to select corrective exercises and to design programs to address
the causes of your clients’ pain and movement
dysfunction.


Fascia

Review of Key Points
Fascia is a three-dimensional network of connective tissue that envelops every structure in
the body, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, and internal organs. While the interconnectedness of fascia enables multiplanar and multidirectional movement, it also means that
musculoskeletal imbalances in one part of the body have a direct impact on movement and
function (or dysfunction) elsewhere.
■■There are two levels of fascia: superficial and deep. The superficial level primarily binds

muscles to skin, and the deep level binds muscles together.
■■Restrictions, adhesions, and scar tissue can affect the ability of fascia to lengthen and

be pliable. This can cause pain and can restrict movement.
■■The term myofascial refers to fascia that is specifically associated with muscles.
■■There are myofascial systems on the front, back, and sides of the body and others that

also wrap around the body.
■■The myofascial systems on the front and back of the body are called the front and back

lines. Those on the sides are called the lateral lines, and those that wrap around the
body are called the spiral lines.
■■The myofascial systems intertwine so that movements in all three planes can occur in

a coordinated fashion.
■■Musculoskeletal imbalances can restrict movement in one area of the body or in a

particular muscle or group. These restrictions can affect the functioning of the entire
myofascial system, causing the body to compensate elsewhere and creating additional
musculoskeletal imbalances.

Self-Check
The ability to explain to clients what fascia is and how myofascial systems affect the body as
a whole is a vital part of successful corrective exercise programming. The following activity will enable you to help clients truly appreciate the interconnectedness of their bodies
and to experience firsthand the amazing impact appropriate corrective exercise strategies
can have on their musculoskeletal systems. Practicing this activity before introducing it to
clients will help you to develop your coaching and communication strategies, and you will
be more confident when you use it to explain the importance of restoring and maintaining
a healthy myofascial system.

Perform the Activity
Gently bend forward from a standing position and reach down toward the ground while
keeping your legs fairly straight. Do not force the movement. Note how far down you can
reach (e.g., just past your knees, to the tops of your feet, fingertips touching the ground).
Return to a normal standing position and place a golf or tennis ball on the underside of
your left foot. Roll it around under your foot, pausing on any sore spots to massage away
tension before moving on to the next sore spot. Do this for one minute, and then transfer the
ball to your right foot and massage the underside of that foot for one minute.
Once you have massaged both feet, put the ball to one side and repeat the forward bending stretch you performed initially. You will notice that you can now reach farther down.

Explain the Results to Your Client
This increased range of movement is a direct result of loosening up the plantar fascia on
the underside of your foot. This fascia is part of the superficial back line of fascia that runs
from under your foot, up the back of your leg, across the back of your pelvis, up your back
and neck, and over your head to the top of your forehead. By increasing the flexibility of the
fascia on the underside of your foot, you increased the movement potential of the myofascial
system on the back of your body. That is why it is now easier to bend forward and lengthen
your reach (Myers 2008).


Part III
Fundamentals of
Corrective Exercise
In part III, you will learn about the elements of a
successful corrective exercise program and how to
select and adapt exercises that address the most
common musculoskeletal imbalances you learned
about in part I. The results of your structural assessments, and your enhanced knowledge of functional
anatomy gleaned from part II, will enable you to
evaluate the suitability of available options. Then
you can make the appropriate recommendations for
clients’ corrective exercise programs.
Part III will teach you specifically about the three
most effective types of corrective exercise: selfmyofascial release techniques, stretching exercises,
and strengthening exercises. You will learn about
the history of these exercises, the unique benefits of
each, and how these modalities have proved successful for addressing and correcting musculoskeletal
imbalances. A variety of different myofascial release
techniques, stretches, and strengthening exercises
are introduced, and you will be taught when to use

each one based on your client’s needs. You will also
learn ways to reduce your clients’ anxiety surrounding the performance of corrective exercises and
strategies to boost their confidence and commitment
to their corrective exercise programs. Furthermore,
you will learn when and how to progress a client’s
program and, conversely, when and how to regress
it when necessary. You will also learn about specific
contraindications for each exercise type to ensure
safety and effectiveness.
In addition to choosing appropriate corrective
exercises, you must be able to educate clients about
nonexercise-related issues that may be contributing to their problems, such as footwear choices, the
use of arch supports, or prolonged static standing,
sitting, and sleeping postures. The last chapter in
part III explains the negative effects of prolonged
static postures, and it offers tips on helping clients
to make better lifestyle choices and assume better
body positions throughout the day.
