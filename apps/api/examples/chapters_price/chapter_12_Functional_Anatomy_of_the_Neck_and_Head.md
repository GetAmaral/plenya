## Chapter 12: Functional Anatomy of the Neck and Head

CHAPTER 12
Functional Anatomy of the
Neck and Head
Most of the human head is made up of several fused
bones that create a dome-shaped cavity called the
skull. The skull protects our brain and many of our
sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, nose, and
tongue (Halim 2009). The head articulates with
the neck, and together with the muscles, tendons,
ligaments, and other soft tissues of this part of the
body, it makes for a very mobile structure that helps
us maintain balance, vision, posture, and musculoskeletal alignment (Clarkson 2000).

BONES AND JOINTS
The skull joins with either side of the mandible at the
temporal bones (figure 12.1; see Temporomandibular Joint later in this chapter for more information)
(Adds and Shahsavari 2012). The skull also connects
to the cervical spine via the atlas bone, which is the
topmost vertebra of the neck (i.e., C1) (Gray 1995).
The rest of the neck is comprised of the remaining six vertebrae of the cervical spine. Positional
changes of the head up and down, side to side, and
in rotation are made possible by movements of the
neck (Peterson and Richmond 1988).

SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES
Here we discuss some key structures in the neck and
head so that you can understand how they influence
movement and participation in activities of daily
living. These structures are intricately linked with
the muscles of the neck and head, and therefore

they can be negatively affected by musculoskeletal
imbalances in these areas.

TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is one of the
most important joints in the neck and head area.
This joint is formed where the mandible articulates
with the temporal bone of the skull (see figure 12.2).
There is a small disc of fibrous cartilage positioned
on either side of the jaw between the end of the
mandible and the temporal bone that enables the
jaw to move smoothly during activities like talking, chewing food, and taking in oxygen through
the mouth (e.g., yawning) (Willard, Zhang, and

Athanasiou 2017). The tissues surrounding these
discs are highly innervated, so when the TMJ is
pulled out of alignment by a forward head position
or excessive cervical lordosis, it often produces pain
and discomfort (Salvo 2009).

NUCHAL LIGAMENT
The nuchal ligament extends from the base of the
skull down to the body of the seventh cervical vertebra (see figure 12.3). This connective tissue acts like
a guide rope to help hold up the head and prevent
excessive neck flexion (such as when looking down
at a book). The nuchal ligament also helps separate
the muscles on either side of the neck (McGowan
1999). Since it also serves as an attachment site for
some muscles of the neck, an irritated, painful nuchal
ligament can disrupt neck and head movements.

MUSCLES
There are many muscles that flex, extend, side bend,
and rotate the neck (Clarkson 2000). This chapter
examines muscles that facilitate these movements
and originate from or attach to the skull or cervical
spine. They include the following:
Longus colli
■ Longus capitis
■ Sternocleidomastoid
■ Semispinalis capitis
■ Semispinalis cervicis
■ Splenius capitis
■ Splenius cervicis
■


Functional Anatomy of the Neck and Head

Longus Colli
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the front of the neck.
It is divided into three portions (superior oblique,
inferior oblique, and vertical) and originates from the
top of the thoracic spine and the bottom of the cervical
spine, travels up the neck, and inserts at the top of the
cervical spine (Gray 1995).

Longus colli

Muscle action(s): Bends the neck and head down and
forward toward the chest (i.e., neck and head flexion).
Due to the position of the muscle on either side of the
neck, when only one side of the muscle activates, it
also helps with side flexion and rotation of the cervical
spine (Palastanga, Field, and Soames 1994).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
longus colli decelerates the neck and head as they arch
or tilt backward (i.e., neck and head extension). They
also help decelerate side bending and rotation of the
neck and head when they are in extension.

E6993/Price/fig.TF12.01/587225/JB/R1

Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense to produce movement of the
neck and head toward the chest during activities like sit-ups. Acts like a bungee cord to slow
down the neck and head when you lean your head back or have to decelerate the head and
neck, such as when going to lie down on the floor or a bed.
Helpful tips: The longus colli is most often damaged during activities where the head is
violently thrown backward, such as the whiplash action that can occur during a car accident.

Longus Capitis
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the front of the neck.
It originates from the middle of the cervical spine,
travels up the neck, and inserts into the base of the
occipital bone (Gray 1995).

Longus capitis

Muscle action(s): Bends the upper cervical spine and
head forward and down (i.e., neck and head flexion)
(Palastanga, Field, and Soames 1994).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of
the longus capitis decelerates the top of the neck as
it arches backward (i.e., extends) and the head as it
tilts back.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional
sense to flex the top of the neck and head toward the
chest during movements like looking down to see if
you have spilled something on your shirt. Acts like
a bungee cord to slow down the top of the neck and
head when they are thrown backward, such as what
would happen if a person were forcefully shoved forward from behind.

E6993/Price/fig.TF12.02/587226/JB/R1

Helpful tips: The literal translation of longus capitis from Latin means “long (muscle) of
the head,” and its position at the top of the neck places it in a useful anatomical position to
control movements of the head.

Sternocleidomastoid
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the front side of the neck.
It originates on the uppermost part of the sternum and the
medial portion of the clavicle, travels up and across the side
of the neck, and inserts below the ear on the mastoid process
of the temporal bone and on the occipital bone (Gray 1995).

Sternocleidomastoid

Muscle action(s): When both sternocleidomastoid muscles
contract together, they bend the neck forward (i.e., flex the
neck) and tip the head backward (i.e., extend the head).
If only one muscle contracts, the neck and head tip to the
same side that is flexed and rotate to the opposite side
(Palastanga, Field, and Soames 1994).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
sternocleidomastoid decelerates the lower neck as it arches
backward (extends) and slows the head and upper neck as
they tilt down and forward. It also helps decelerate side
bending and rotation of the neck when only one side is
lengthened.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense to hold the head up, such as
when performing sit-ups or oblique crunches. Acts like a bungee E6993/Price/TF12.03/587227/mh-R2
cord during movements
that require tucking of the head and chin such as the lowering phase of a sit-up.
Helpful tips: The longus colli and sternocleidomastoid work together to slow down neck
extension. This is especially important in situations where the body is hit and the neck arches
backward, like when one is hit from behind in bumper cars.

Semispinalis Capitis
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the back of the neck. It
originates on the upper thoracic spine and lower cervical
spine, travels up the neck, and inserts at the back of the
skull on the occipital bone (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Extends the neck and head. If only one
side of the semispinalis capitis contracts, then the head
bends to the same side and rotates toward the opposite side
(Chaitow and DeLany 2008).

Semispinalis
capitis

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the semispinalis capitis helps decelerate forward bending (flexion)
of the neck and head. It also decelerates side bending and
rotation of the neck and head when they are in flexion.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense
during all seated postures where the head and neck are
tilted back and up to enable the eyes to look up like when
sitting on the floor to watch TV. Acts like a bungee cord
to slow down the weight of the head as it tips forward and
from side to side, such as what might happen if you were
to fall asleep in a chair.

E6993/Price/Fig.TF12.04/587228/R2JB

Helpful tips: There are actually three semispinalis muscles: capitis, cervicis, and thoracis.
As the name implies, semispinalis thoracis is primarily involved in extension and rotation
of the thoracic spine, whereas capitis and cervicis affect movements of the head and neck,
respectively.


Functional Anatomy of the Neck and Head

Semispinalis Cervicis
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the back of the upper
torso and neck. It originates from the vertebrae of the
middle and upper thoracic spine, runs up along the
spine, and inserts on the vertebrae of the middle and
upper cervical spine (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Extends the neck. If only one
side of the muscle contracts, then the neck bends to
the same side and rotates toward the opposite side
(Chaitow and DeLany 2008).

Semispinalis
cervicis

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
semispinalis cervicis decelerates bending of the neck
forward (flexion of the neck). It also helps decelerate
side bending and rotation of the neck when it is in
flexion.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense to lift E6993/Price/TF12.05/587229/mh-R2
the head up by extending
the neck during activities such as bicycle riding, where you must lift your head up to look
where you are going. Acts like a bungee cord to help slow down the head as it tips forward
or from side to side by decelerating bending of the neck during activities like looking down
at your feet.
Helpful tips: Neck muscles react to the many pain receptors in this area. This may explain
why muscular tension in the neck is so common (Ferrari 2006).

Splenius Capitis
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the back of the neck.
It originates from the upper thoracic spine, the last
vertebrae of the cervical spine and the nuchal ligament, and travels up and outward along the neck
before inserting behind the bottom of the ear on the
skull (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Helps extend the neck and head.
If one side of the splenius capitis muscle contracts
without the other, then the head bends and rotates to
the same side (Lee 2017).

Splenius
capitis

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the
splenius capitis decelerates flexion of the neck and
head (i.e., nodding downward). It also decelerates
side bending and rotation of the neck and head when
they are in flexion.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense during all movements that
require the head to be lifted up to keep the eyes focused and level with the horizon, such as
when walking. Acts like a bungee cord to slow the neck and theE6993/Price/TF12.06/587230/mh-R3
head as they tip forward,
such as when looking down to pet a dog.
Helpful tips: The splenius capitis acts as a fastener of sorts that holds the head firmly to
the neck. In fact, its name comes from the Latin words splenium meaning “plaster” and
capitis meaning “of the head.”

Splenius Cervicis
Muscle specifics: A muscle on the back of the
upper torso and neck. It originates from the middle
of the thoracic spine, travels up the neck, and
inserts at the top of the neck (Gray 1995).
Muscle action(s): Helps with arching the neck
backward (neck extension). If one side of the
muscle contracts without the other, then the head
bends and rotates to the same side (Lee 2017).

Splenius
cervicis

Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of
the splenius cervicis decelerates flexion of the neck.
It also helps decelerate side bending and rotation
of the neck when it is in flexion.
Real-life movement example: Works in a traditional sense to keep the neck extended so the head can sit correctly on top of the shoulders
during all upright and weight-bearing movements, like walking
and running. Acts like a
E6993/Price/TF12.07/587231/mh-R1
bungee cord to slow down the neck as it rounds forward, such as when reading a book or
looking at your lap when seated.
Helpful tips: The splenius cervicis originates on the thoracic spine and attaches on the
neck. Therefore, imbalances in the thoracic spine can affect the function of this muscle and
the resulting position of the cervical spine and head.

EFFECT OF THE NECK
AND HEAD MUSCLES
ON THE MOST COMMON
MUSCULOSKELETAL
DEVIATIONS
Musculoskeletal imbalances in the neck and head
can affect the position of the entire body because
the structures beneath must compensate to keep
balance mechanisms like the eyes and inner ears
working correctly (Lieberman 2011). Similarly,
dysfunctions below the neck and head can place
the neck and head muscles under stress as they try
to compensate for problems elsewhere (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
Here are three examples of how the bungee cord
feature of specific muscles covered in this chapter
factor into the most common deviations of the neck
and head.

EXAMPLE ONE: LONGUS
COLLI AND LONGUS CAPITIS
The longus colli and longus capitis muscles help
flex the neck. However, excessive cervical lordosis

(extension of the neck) can cause chronic lengthening of these muscles, and this can affect their function. Specifically, dysfunctions in these muscles can
inhibit the neck from flexing well and can prevent
the head from achieving its optimal position. For
example, imagine that during a consultation with
a prospective client you slouch with your fist under
your chin supporting your head as you sit listening.
In this position, your neck must arch backward to
keep your eyes on your customer. When you try to
correct your posture at the end of the chat by sitting
upright, pulling your head back, tucking your chin
in, and flexing your neck, irritation in the longus
colli and longus capitis muscles can make it difficult
(Price and Bratcher 2010).

EXAMPLE TWO:
STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID
The sternocleidomastoid muscles originate on the
front of the rib cage and attach to the base of the
skull just behind the ears. When the thoracic spine
rounds forward, it causes the sternum and clavicle
bones to drop down with the rib cage. This downward shift of the rib cage creates a pull via the
sternocleidomastoid on the back of the skull, which
in turn causes the head to tip backward and the
top of the cervical spine to arch, causing excessive
cervical lordosis (see figure 12.4).


Functional Anatomy of the Neck and Head

Over time, this series of compensation patterns
can affect the functioning of the sternocleidomastoid
muscles, making it difficult to return the head and
the cervical and thoracic spine to their optimal positions. However, if the sternocleidomastoid muscles
are healthy and functional, they can be used to pull
up the front of the rib cage and correct many of the
musculoskeletal imbalances found in the thoracic
and cervical spine. For example, when the head is
pulled back and the chin is tucked in to achieve a
neutral position for the head, the insertions of the
sternocleidomastoids on the back of the skull pull
away from their origins on the sternum and clavicles.
This produces extension of the thoracic spine,
flexion of the upper cervical spine, and a correct
position for the head (see figure 12.5) (Price and
Bratcher 2010).

127

EXAMPLE THREE: SEMISPINALIS
CAPITIS, SEMISPINALIS
CERVICIS, SPLENIUS CAPITIS,
AND SPLENIUS CERVICIS
Musculoskeletal imbalances in the neck and head can
cause the muscles that extend them to become chronically shortened. As a result, they cannot lengthen
effectively when you try to perform such everyday
movements as rounding your neck forward or tilting
your head down. This can produce dysfunctional compensations like the thoracic spine rounding forward
instead (see figure 12.6). When the extensor muscles
of the neck and head are supple and healthy, they
can work in a bungee cord fashion to help keep the
neck and head (and consequently the thoracic spine)
functioning as they should (Price and Bratcher 2010).

Review of Key Points
The head contains our most vital organ, the brain, which enables us to perceive our environment through sensory organs and maintain balance through the vestibular system. To help
keep this part of the body working well, the neck and head must be correctly aligned and
functioning effectively.
■■A forward head position shifts the body’s center of gravity forward and effectively

increases the weight of the head in relation to the body. For every inch that the head is
forward of its optimal position, the effect of its weight on the body approximately doubles.
■■The alignment and function of the temporomandibular joint are affected by musculoskel-

etal imbalances in the neck and head. Popping and grinding noises in the jaw, difficulty
chewing, jaw ache, headaches, or any pain or dysfunction in this area may result from
such imbalances.
■■The sternocleidomastoids can be used to help align the head, neck and thoracic spine.

Pulling the head back and the chin in will lift the rib cage upward and will promote neck
and head flexion and thoracic extension.
■■Excessive cervical lordosis can lead to irritation of the muscles on the back of the neck.

This can prevent these muscles and soft tissues from lengthening correctly when the
neck and head must flex.
■■While neck flexor muscles such as the longus colli, longus capitis, and sternocleidomas-

toid help flex the neck toward the chest, they also lengthen like bungee cords to protect
the neck from unnecessary stress as it arches backward.
■■Musculoskeletal imbalances in the neck and head create compensation patterns through-

out the rest of the body, and vice versa.

Self-Check
The following exercise is designed to help you become aware of how postural positions in
different parts of the body affect the head and neck.
Stand in front of a full-length mirror and perform the movements listed in the following
chart. Observe how your neck and head change position in response to these movements.
Use your structural assessment knowledge and understanding of muscles and movement to
identify what structures of the head and neck are affected as you change the alignment of
different areas of the body. Record your findings in the chart. An example has been provided.
