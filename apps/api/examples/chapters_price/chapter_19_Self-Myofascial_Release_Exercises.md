# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 19: Self-Myofascial Release Exercises

CHAPTER 19
Self-Myofascial Release
Exercises
Self-myofascial release (SMR) techniques are used
at the outset of a client’s corrective exercise program
to rejuvenate and restore soft tissues that have been
adversely affected by musculoskeletal imbalances
(Rolf 1989; Myers 2008; Travell and Simons 1992;
Price 2013). They are extremely useful for immediately reducing painful symptoms or movement
restrictions while simultaneously allowing inflamed
joints to rest and recover (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Generally speaking, the symptoms of unhealthy
fascia and soft tissues are experienced as pain or
discomfort in those target areas where the selfmyofascial techniques are being performed. You
and your client can use these sensations to help you
gauge whether the SMR techniques you recommend
are reducing the discomfort or, in rare cases, are
exacerbating the symptoms. When a client performs
SMR exercises under your supervision, watch his
body language and his facial expressions for signs of
discomfort or unease. Listen to his voice and breathing for indications of distress, and watch his body for
signs that he is not comfortable in the position you
have suggested for the exercise. If a client is stressed
or uncomfortable for any reason, you have to change
the exercise to make sure that he can relax and not
hurt himself. Never encourage a client to try to “push
through the pain” when performing any type of selfmyofascial release exercise (Price and Bratcher 2010).

SELF-MYOFASCIAL
RELEASE QUICK TIPS
There are a number of tips and cueing strategies for
introducing clients to self-myofascial release techniques. Following is a brief recap of tactics to use
when familiarizing clients with the SMR component
of their corrective exercise programs (Barnes 1999;
Price and Bratcher 2010).
■■Always explain why they are performing a

particular self-myofascial release exercise
and how it applies to their musculoskeletal
imbalances.
■■When teaching these techniques, give your
clients time to explore any tight areas or sore
spots for themselves.
■■Do not recommend SMR techniques that are not
practical for clients to perform on their own. For
instance, the equipment requirements must be
reasonable for them.
■■Regress an SMR technique if the client feels
uncomfortable in any way or experiences pain.
SMR techniques can be regressed by using a
softer massage tool, by applying heat to the
affected area, or by changing body position,
such as lying down.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

■■If a client does not understand or cannot per-

form an SMR technique correctly, regress the
exercise or suggest an alternative.
■■Progress the SMR program when the client no
longer feels tenderness in an affected area. SMR
techniques can be progressed by using a harder
massage ball or a firmer roller or by integrating
movement into the technique.
■■Progress a client’s SMR program when the
affected area has reached the range of motion
needed to advance to stretching exercises.

■■SMR may remain a part of your clients’ ongoing

daily corrective exercise homework.

Reminder
Review the comprehensive information in
Chapter 15 on teaching tips, progressions and
regressions, and when not to use self-myofascial release techniques before you introduce
clients to any of the exercises in this chapter.


Self-Myofascial Release Exercises

SELF-MYOFASCIAL RELEASE EXERCISE LIBRARY
The self-myofascial release techniques highlighted in this chapter can be used to benefit
a wide variety of corrective exercise clients. They are easy to perform in a gym setting, at
home, at the office, or when traveling because they require minimal equipment that is easily
accessible to most people. As a rule, SMR exercises using foam rollers will enable clients to
massage larger areas of muscle and tissues, while those that use small massage balls or tools
are useful for targeting smaller trigger points in specific areas.

191


Golf Ball Roll
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, lack of dorsiflexion
Structures addressed: Plantar fascia and muscles of the lower leg that terminate on the underside of the foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps regenerate and rejuvenate the plantar
fascia and muscles that terminate on the bottom of the foot, which can become
irritated as a result of overpronation. Increasing the flexibility of these tissues
will also help promote increased dorsiflexion.
How to perform
1. Place a golf ball on the underside of the foot.
2. Roll it back and forth until you feel sore or tender spots.
3. Pause on each sore spot and apply pressure to help each sore spot release.

192


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 30 seconds to 1 minute under each foot at
least once per day, spending more time under the side that has more sore spots.
Tip: To increase adherence encourage clients to keep a golf ball by the bed or
couch so they can perform this exercise when they get up in the morning and
at night before bed or while watching TV.
Precaution: Avoid using excessive pressure because it can irritate the structures of the feet.
Progress: Add an active stretch by pulling the toes up while rolling.

Regress: If a golf ball is too painful, use a tennis ball instead, or perform the
exercise while seated.

193


Calf Massage
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees
Imbalance(s): Lack of dorsiflexion, ovepronation, tracking problems of the knee
Structures addressed: Gastrocnemius and soleus
Exercise benefits: Massaging the muscles on the back of the calf can help
realign and rejuvenate the soft tissue structures of the lower leg. Because the
gastrocnemius and soleus muscles attach to the heel, this exercise will help
improve dorsiflexion and consequently decrease overpronation. It will also help
the knee bend more effectively (due to the fact that the ankle and knee bend
together during many weight-bearing activities such as squatting, walking,
and lunging).
How to perform
1. Sit down, place the ankle of the side being massaged on the knee of the
opposite leg and grasp the belly of the calf with your hands.
2. Massage across the muscle or up and down.
3. Target knots or adhesions during the massage.

194


Duration and repetitions: Massage 1 to 2 minutes at least once per day.
Tip: To increase adherence encourage clients to use this massage technique
while they are sitting at home watching TV or at work.
Progress: Use a massage device on the calf or perform the Calf Stretch.

Regress: Use a hard ball (such as a baseball or lacrosse ball) placed on a book
with the calf muscle placed on top of the ball.

195


Foam Roller Quadriceps
Area(s) of body: Knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Tracking problems of the knee, anterior pelvic tilt
Structures addressed: Quadriceps muscles
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps rejuvenate and regenerate the quadriceps muscles to enable the knee and pelvis to function correctly. Note: Releasing
all of the quadriceps muscles will help with tracking of the patella. However,
releasing the rectus femoris will also help with an anterior pelvic tilt due to its
origin on the front of pelvis.
How to perform
1. Place the roller perpendicular to the leg and lie over it; pressure should be
on the thigh.
2. Find a sore spot and hold body weight on it for several seconds to help the
tissues release.
3. Use the upper body to roll the roller to different sore spots on the upper
leg; keep the abdominals engaged to ensure that the lower back does not
arch too much.

196


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 1 to 2 minutes on each leg at least once
per day.
Tip: Moving toward the outside of the leg (about 6 inches [15 cm] below the
hip) focuses on the rectus femoris. Centering releases all quadriceps muscles.
Progress: Bend the knee when rolling, or perform a Quadriceps Stretch.

Regress: Lie on your stomach or side and use a half roller or tennis ball.

197


Foam Roller IT Band
Area(s) of body: Knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt
Structures addressed: Iliotibial band (IT band)
Exercise benefits: The IT band attaches the gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae muscles to the lower leg. When the foot overpronates, the IT band gets
stressed and can pull the leg, knee, and pelvis out of alignment. Foam rolling the
IT band will help align these structures and allow them to function correctly.
How to perform
1. Lie on your side with hips stacked and forearm resting on the floor; the
bottom leg rests on top of the foam roller so the pressure is on the outside
of the leg.
2. To decrease pressure on the IT band, place the top leg in front of the body
and rest the foot on the floor.
3. Roll from the hip to the knee without crossing the knee; move about 1 to 2
inches (3 to 5 cm) at a time, concentrating on the sore spots.

198


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 30 seconds to 2 minutes on both legs at
least once per day.
Tip: A foam roller can be purchased for about $20 to $50.
Precaution: Do not roll over the knee joint when using the foam roller.
Progress: Use a harder (more dense) roller, or stack the legs so they are on
top of each other.

Regress: Lie on your side on a half roller or a tennis ball to massage the IT
band; move the half roller or ball from each sore spot along the length of the IT
band as tension decreases.

199


Foam Roller on Inner Thigh
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, knees
Imbalance(s): Valgus knee position, overpronation, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Adductor group of muscles
Exercise benefits: The adductor muscles lengthen under tension during
weight-bearing activities to slow down rotation, abduction, flexion, and extension
of the leg. Rejuvenating and regenerating these tissues will help these muscles
to function better to lessen the effects of excessive lumbar lordosis, an anterior
pelvic tilt, a valgus knee position, and overpronation.
How to perform
1. Lie face down, bend the knee and hip of the leg being targeted, and place
the roller perpendicular to the inner thigh.
2. Find a sore spot on the inner thigh, and hold body weight on it for a few
seconds to help the tissues release.
3. Move the upper body to roll to different sore spots on the inner thigh.

200


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 1 to 2 minutes on each side at least once
per day.
Tip: Balance the body weight on the opposite side or hip, and use your arms to
control the amount of pressure felt on the roller.
Precaution: Do not let the lower back over-arch when performing this exercise.
Progress: Perform the Adductor Stretch.

Regress: Use a heating pad on the adductors.

201


Foam Roller Hip Flexors
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, valgus knee
position, lack of dorsiflexion, overpronation
Structures addressed: Hip flexor group of muscles
Exercise benefits: Rejuvenating and regenerating the hip flexor muscles will
help the lumbar spine flex, enabling the pelvis to posteriorly rotate more effectively. The hip flexors also work eccentrically to slow down internal rotation and
extension of the leg. Therefore, flexibility in these tissues will also help promote
better movement of the hip, leg, knee, and ankle.
How to perform
1. Place the roller perpendicular to the front of the body, and lie over it at
hip level.
2. Find a sore spot on the front of the hips, and hold body weight on it for a
few seconds to help the tissues release.
3. Move the upper body to roll to different sore spots on the upper leg; keep the
abdominals engaged to ensure that the lower back does not arch too much.

202


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side at
least once per day.
Tip: Angle the roller so that it is in line with the crease of the groin (i.e., at 45
degrees to the hip and leg) to increase the pressure of the massage.
Progress: Perform the Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal).

Regress: Use a tennis ball to massage the hip flexors (see detailed information
in next exercise).

203


Tennis Ball on Hip Flexors
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, knees
Imbalance(s): Excessive lumbar lordosis, anterior pelvic tilt, valgus knee
position, overpronation, lack of dorsiflexion
Structures addressed: Hip flexor group of muscles
Exercise benefits: Using a tennis ball to target the origin of the psoas major
muscle (on the sides of the lumbar spine) and iliacus (from the front and inside
of the pelvis) will directly help to improve the function of the lumbar spine and
pelvis. Releasing these tissues will also improve the function of the legs, knees,
feet, and ankles.
How to perform
1. Lie face down, and place a tennis ball on the abdominals beside the belly
button to target the psoas major muscle (which lies under the abdominals).
2. Scoot your body to move the ball to any sore spots all the way down from
beside the belly button to the top of the hip.
Note: Massaging just inside the ASIS (the bony protuberance on the front of the
pelvis) will release the iliacus.

204


Duration and repetitions: Hold on each sore spot for 20 to 30 seconds. Perform at least once a day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes on both sides of the body.
Tip: Internally rotate the leg (i.e., turn the foot in) to help stretch the hip flexors
while performing this exercise.
Precaution: If you feel a pulse under the tennis ball, simply move the ball
slightly to reduce pressure on the femoral artery.
Progress: Use a larger and firmer ball, such as a softball, to help increase pressure through the abdominals to the hip flexor muscles. Perform the Hip Flexor
Stretch (Transverse).

Regress: Apply heat to the area while you lie on your back with the leg straight.

205


Foam Roller Gluteal Complex
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, knees
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, valgus knee position
Structures addressed: Gluteus maximus and hip rotators (e.g., piriformis).
Also targets gluteus medius and gluteus minimus when roller is angled toward
the side of the hip and buttocks.
Exercise benefits: An anterior pelvic tilt can adversely affect the muscles on
the back of the hips. Foam rolling this area will help regenerate these tissues
and enable the pelvis, hips, and legs to move into better alignment.
How to perform
1. Sit down on a foam roller, and lean your body to one side to place weight
on the gluteal complex on that side.
2. Lift the foot of the side being targeted, and place the outside of that ankle
on the opposite knee.
3. Pull your knee to your chest on the side being massaged, and roll back and
forth to release and stretch the muscles of that area.
4. Increase stretch by pulling the knee in more toward the chest.

206


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 30 seconds to 2 minutes on both sides at
least once per day.
Tip: The hip rotator muscles run transversely across the middle of the butt.
This area will most likely be irritated and sore on those with an anterior pelvic
tilt and valgus knee position.
Precaution: If numbing or tingling is felt, decrease pressure to the area or
stop the exercise.
Progress: Use a harder foam roller or perform the Glute Stretch.

Regress: Massage the glutes using a tennis ball or baseball.

207


Tennis Ball Side of Hip
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, knees
Imbalance(s): Valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt
Structures addressed: Abductor group of muscles
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps the hip and leg complex and the knee
to function correctly by rejuvenating and regenerating the abductor muscles
on the lateral side of the hip and leg.
How to perform
1. Lie on your side with your head resting on a pillow to help keep the head
and neck aligned.
2. Place a tennis ball under the lateral side of the hip just above the top of the
leg on the side in contact with the ground.
3. Find a sore spot and hold there to release.
4. Move the ball gently to another sore spot and hold to release.

208


Duration and repetitions: Hold for 20 to 30 seconds on each sore spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: If the pressure felt in the area is too much, simply roll the body slightly off
the ball to decrease the pressure.
Progress: Perform the Abductor Stretch or the Door Frame Stretch.

Regress: Use a foam roller to massage the side of the hip instead of a tennis ball.

209


One Tennis Ball on Lower Back
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Lumbar erector spinae muscles and thoracolumbar
fascia
Exercise benefits: An anterior pelvic tilt and excessive lumbar lordosis can
cause the muscles and fascia of the lower back to become overworked and tight.
This exercise helps rejuvenate and regenerate the muscles and fascia of the
lower back to release tension in this area to enable the lumbar spine to flex and
the pelvis to posteriorly rotate.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back; use a pillow under your neck if needed to make sure your
eyes stay perpendicular to the ceiling.
2. Bend your knees to keep the pelvis posteriorly tilted, and place one tennis
ball on one side of the spine in the lower back area; adjust the ball until a
sore spot is found, and hold to release tension.
3. Move your body up or down to move the ball either up or down to fi nd
additional sore spots; hold to release tension.

210


Duration and repetitions: Hold for 20 to 30 seconds on each sore spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Precaution: Do not place the ball too close to the spine. Also, when traveling
up the spine to the bottom of the rib cage, be careful not to place too much
pressure on this area because this may cause discomfort.
Progress: Bend the knees and place the ankle of the side being massaged on
the knee of the opposite leg. Perform the Lower Back Stretch.

Regress: Support the opposite hip with a hand to help keep the pelvis level.

211


Foam Roller Quadratus Lumborum
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Quadratus lumborum
Exercise benefits: The quadratus lumborum (QL) is responsible for hiking
the hip up toward the bottom of the rib cage, extending and side-flexing the
lumbar spine. Releasing this muscle will enable the pelvis and lumbar spine to
function more effectively.
How to perform
1. Sit down on a foam roller with knees bent and pelvis posteriorly tilted.
2. Gently slide down the roller until it is positioned just above the back of the
hip.
3. Use the roller to release the area between the bottom of the ribs and the
top of the pelvis, focusing on one side at a time.

212


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 30 seconds to 1 minute on both sides at
least once per day.
Precaution: Use caution when performing this exercise to avoid rolling over
the bottom two ribs with too much pressure. They are floating ribs that do not
attach to the sternum, and they can displace or become injured easily.
Progress: Perform the Door Frame Stretch.

Regress: Place the ankle on the knee and use a tennis ball to massage the QL.

213


Two Tennis Balls on Upper Back
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Thoracic erector spinae muscles, rhomboids, and
middle fibers of trapezius muscle
Exercise benefits: Excessive thoracic kyphosis causes the erector muscles of
the upper back and the retractors of the scapula to become chronically lengthened. Rejuvenating and regenerating these muscles will help release tension in
this area and prepare the muscles of the thoracic spine and shoulder blades to
be fortified with subsequent strengthening exercises.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent; place two tennis balls on either
side of the spine under the upper back at approximately bra height or just
below the shoulder blades.
2. Use a pillow to support your head and to keep your eyes perpendicular to
the ceiling; the use of a pillow will also help control the amount of pressure felt on the back from the balls (i.e., a larger pillow will decrease the
pressure felt).
3. Find a sore spot and hold to release tension.
4. Move your body up or down to move the balls either up or down to fi nd
additional sore spots; hold to release tension.

214


Duration and repetitions: Hold for 20 to 30 seconds on each sore spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Precaution: Regress this exercise immediately if breathing feels restricted or
if tension is experienced in the chest.
Progress: Tilt the pelvis to increase pressure from the balls, or perform the
Shoulder Retraction on Floor exercise.

Regress: Use a higher pillow to support your head, or use one only ball at a time.

215


Foam Roller Thoracic Spine
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Thoracic erectors, rhomboids, and trapezius
Exercise benefits: This exercise rejuvenates the muscles of the thoracic spine
and shoulders by releasing excessive tension in this area to help correct excessive thoracic kyphosis and a protracted shoulder girdle.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back over the foam roller with your hands behind your head
and your chin tucked in (the roller should be perpendicular to the torso).
2. Bend your knees, tuck your hips under, and lift your pelvis off the floor.
3. Roll back and forth along the thoracic spine, massaging sore or tender spots.

216


Duration and repetitions: Roll for 30 seconds to 2 minutes at least once per
day.
Tip: Support your head while rolling to protect your neck from stress.
Precaution: Keep your pelvis posteriorly tilted to avoid excessive arching of
the lower back.
Progress: Drop your hips to the ground and tilt your pelvis, or perform the
Straight Arm Raise.

Regress: Two Tennis Balls on Upper Back.

217


Foam Roller on Lats
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Protracted shoulder girdle, internally rotated arms
Structures addressed: Latissimus dorsi muscle
Exercise benefits: Excessive tension in the latissimus dorsi muscle can cause
the arms to internally rotate. Rejuvenating and regenerating this tissue will help
the arms and the rest of the shoulder complex to sit in better alignment. It will
also help prepare the latissimus dorsi for subsequent strengthening exercises
designed to retract (and depress) the shoulder girdle.
How to perform
1. Lie on your side, placing a foam roller under your armpit and perpendicular
to your body.
2. Move back and forth on the roller, changing positions of the body so that
the foam roller places pressure toward the back of the torso as you roll.
3. Pause on any sore spots to release tension before moving the roller to
another position.

218


Duration and repetitions: Hold for 20 to 30 seconds on each sore spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: It is easier to let the bottom leg and hip rest on the floor when performing
this exercise.
Precaution: Do not place too much pressure on the rib cage during this exercise.
Progress: Perform the Door Frame Stretch.

Regress: Massage the latissimus dorsi muscle using a tennis ball.

219


Tennis Ball Around Shoulder Blade
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Protracted shoulder girdle, elevated scapula
Structures addressed: Rhomboids and trapezius muscles
Exercise benefits: Massaging the shoulder retractors will help you address
imbalances throughout the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle and will prepare
these tissues for subsequent strengthening exercises.
How to perform
1. Lie on the floor with your knees bent and your head resting on a pillow.
2. Pull one arm across your chest and place a tennis ball under your upper
back beside the shoulder blade of that arm between the shoulder blade
and the spine.
3. Find a sore spot and hold to release tension.
4. Move the ball gently to another spot and hold to release tension.

220


Duration and repetitions: Hold for 20 to 30 seconds on each sore spot. Perform at least once per day.
Precaution: Do not roll around dynamically when performing this exercise;
this is to avoid damaging nerves of the shoulder complex. Hold pressure on each
sore spot until it releases.
Progress: Perform the Seated Row.

Regress: Use a softer ball (like a racquetball) or perform the exercise standing
against a wall.

221


Tennis Ball on Shoulder Blade
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Elevated scapula, internally rotated arms
Structures addressed: Infraspinatus, teres minor, and trapezius muscle
Exercise benefits: The infraspinatus, teres minor, and middle and lower
fibers of the trapezius can become chronically lengthened by internally rotated
arms and an elevated scapula. Rejuvenating and regenerating these muscles
to prepare them for strengthening exercises will help depress the scapula and
externally rotate the arms.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back and place a tennis ball on top of the shoulder blade; use a
pillow under your head to keep your head and neck aligned.
2. Hug the opposite shoulder in order to increase pressure on the ball and get
the arm out of the way; readjust the position of the ball if necessary to fi nd
a sore spot, and hold to release tension.
3. Move your body carefully up, down, or sideways to move the ball to fi nd
additional sore spots; hold to release tension.

222


Duration and repetitions: Hold for 20 to 30 seconds on each sore spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: Adjust the arm position slightly on the side being massaged to focus on
different muscles.
Precaution: Do not roll around vigorously on the ball. Instead, move your body
to each sore spot found and then hold the ball on that spot. Be careful when
moving the ball to avoid placing direct pressure on nerves.
Progress: Perform the Wave Goodbye.

Regress: Use a heating pad, or perform the exercise standing against a wall.

223


Abdominal Massage
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, thoracic spine, and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Anterior abdominal muscles and abdominal fascia
Exercise benefits: Excessive thoracic kyphosis results in a chronic shortening
of the abdominals. In this case, the muscles and fascia of the abdomen become
restricted and tight, thereby affecting movement of the torso and spine. Releasing and regenerating the abdominal muscles and fascia will enable the thoracic
spine to extend more effectively and the shoulders to retract, and this will allow
greater movement throughout the torso, spine, and shoulder complex.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your head supported by a pillow
to keep the head and neck neutral.
2. Use your hands to massage the abdomen from the bottom of the rib cage
down to the pelvis, concentrating on any sore spots.

224


Duration and repetitions: Perform at least once per day for a total of 1 to 2
minutes.
Precaution: Some people may find initially that massaging their abdominal
area makes them feel nauseous. If this is the case, regress or reduce the amount
of pressure applied.
Progress: Use a handheld massage device to massage the abdominals, or lie
face down on top of a massage ball like a tennis ball or baseball.

Regress: Use a heating pad.

225


Chest Massage
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Internally rotated arms, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Pectoral muscles
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps rejuvenate and regenerate the pectoral
muscles and releases tension caused by internally rotated arms and a protracted
shoulder girdle. Targeting the pectoral muscles will allow the arms to externally
rotate and the shoulders to retract.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with knees bent and your head supported by a pillow to
keep the head and neck neutral.
2. Using the fi ngers of one hand, gently massage the chest muscles on the
opposite side.

226


Duration and repetitions: Massage each sore spot for 20 to 30 seconds. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: This exercise can also be performed while seated at work to address issues
caused by prolonged desk work.
Progress: Perform this exercise while lying on your stomach with a tennis ball
under your chest. Perform the Why Stretch or the Shoulder Retraction on Floor.

Regress: Use a heating pad.

227


Front of Shoulder Massage
Area(s) of body: Shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Internally rotated arms, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Supraspinatus, anterior deltoid, and origin of the
biceps muscles
Exercise benefits: Internally rotated arms affect the function of the shoulder,
arm, and shoulder girdle. Releasing tension in the muscles at the front of the
shoulder will enable the arms to externally rotate and the scapula to retract.
It will also prepare these muscles for subsequent stretching and strengthening
exercises.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with knees bent and head supported on a pillow to keep
your head and neck neutral.
2. Using the fi ngers of one hand, gently massage the muscles of the front of
the shoulder on the opposite side.

228


Duration and repetitions: Massage each sore spot for 20 to 30 seconds. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: Perform this exercise in conjunction with the Chest Massage to loosen up
the entire anterior shoulder and chest region.
Progress: Perform the exercise lying on your stomach with a tennis ball on the
front of your shoulder. Perform the Front of Shoulder Stretch (massage front of
shoulder with opposite hand for maximum benefit).

Regress: Use a heating pad.

229


Tennis Ball on Biceps
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Elevated scapula, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Biceps muscles
Exercise benefits: The biceps brachii originates on the shoulder blade, and
excessive tension in this muscle can elevate and protract the shoulder blade.
Rejuvenating and regenerating the biceps will help the shoulder blade fall back
into better alignment.
How to perform
1. Lie face down with the arm outstretched straight and the palm facing down.
2. Place a tennis ball on the biceps muscle, and position your body to fi nd a
sore spot.
3. Scoot your body to move the ball to any sore spots to relieve tension.

230


Duration and repetitions: Hold on each sore spot for 20 to 30 seconds. Perform at least once a day for a total of 1 to 2 minutes.
Tip: Internally rotate the arm gently when performing this exercise to help
stretch and release the biceps muscle at the same time.
Precaution: If the neck feels uncomfortable during this exercise, simply turn
the head to the other side.
Progress: Perform the Biceps Stretch.

Regress: Use a softer tennis ball or heat on the arm while lying face-up with
the arm outstretched.

231


Forearm Massage
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Internally rotated arms
Structures addressed: Forearm muscles and insertion of the biceps brachii
Exercise benefits: Restrictions in the upper or lower arm can affect the function of the glenohumeral joint and the shoulder complex. This exercise releases
and rejuvenates the muscles and fascia in the forearm to enable the whole arm
and shoulder to move more effectively.
How to perform
1. Sit in a chair and bring one arm across your abdomen; use the thumb and
fi ngers of the other hand to massage the inside and outside of the forearm.
2. Apply steady pressure to each sore spot until it releases, and then move
to the next spot.

232


Duration and repetitions: Massage each sore spot for 20 to 30 seconds. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: This is a great exercise for everyone who uses a computer or their forearms
regularly (e.g., tennis players, golfers, or people who work out a lot gripping
heavy weights).
Progress: Perform the exercise using a tennis or a baseball placed on a desk
with your forearm balanced on top of the ball. Perform the Palm on Wall Stretch.

Regress: Use a heating pad or a handheld massager to massage the forearm.

233


Hand Massage
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Internally rotated arms, protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Muscles of the hand
Exercise benefits: Muscles of the hand are interconnected with muscles of
the shoulder complex via chains of fascia. This exercise helps rejuvenate and
regenerate the muscles and fascia of the hand so that the wrist, arm, and shoulder can function correctly.
How to perform
Massage the base of the thumb and between the thumb and forefinger with the
fingers and thumb of the opposite hand.

234


Duration and repetitions: Massage each sore spot for 20 to 30 seconds. Perform at least once per day for a total of 1 to 2 minutes.
Tip: This is a great self-massage technique for people who use their hands a
lot, either mousing on a computer or engaging in hobbies such as gardening.
Progress: Perform the Forearm Stretch or the Palm on Wall Stretch.

Regress: Use a heating pad.

235


Theracane on Trapezius
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, neck, and head
Imbalance(s): Elevated scapula, excessive cervical lordosis
Structures addressed: Upper fibers of the trapezius and the extensors of the
neck and head
Exercise benefits: The muscles that elevate the scapula and extend the neck
and head can become restricted and tight as a result of excessive cervical lordosis and an elevated scapula. This exercise helps release tension in the upper
traps and neck extensors to enable the shoulder blades to depress and the head
and neck to flex more easily.
How to perform
1. Sit in a chair, and place the hook end of the Theracane on the top of the
shoulder (i.e., on the upper trapezius).
2. Apply pressure to the upper traps by pulling the handle of the Theracane
down and out to apply pressure to any sore spots on the trapezius and neck
extensors; hold to release tension.
3. Move the hook end of the Theracane to other sore spots and apply pressure;
hold to release tension.

236


Duration and repetitions: Apply pressure for 20 to 30 seconds to each sore
spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Precaution: Apply steady pressure, and do not move the Theracane around
vigorously; otherwise the device may slip or hurt the nerves in the neck.
Progress: Bend your neck to the side to add a stretch or perform the Straight
Arm Pulldown.

Regress: Use a heating pad.

237


Theracane Back of Neck
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, neck, and head
Imbalance(s): Excessive cervical lordosis, forward head
Structures addressed: Neck extensors, upper trapezius, and fascia of the neck
Exercise benefits: A forward head position and excessive cervical lordosis
can cause the muscles and fascia on the back of the neck to become irritated.
This exercise helps rejuvenate and regenerate these tissues so that the neck
can flex more easily and the head can move back into better alignment. It also
helps prepare these muscles for subsequent strengthening exercises.
How to perform
1. Sit in a chair, and place the hook end of the Theracane on the back of your
neck.
2. Apply pressure by pulling the Theracane down and out to apply pressure
to any sore spot in the area; hold to release tension.
3. Move the hook end of the Theracane to other sore spots and apply pressure;
hold to release tension.

238


Duration and repetitions: Apply pressure for 20 to 30 seconds to each sore
spot. Perform at least once per day for a total of 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip: This is a great exercise for people who look at a computer screen or watch
television a lot throughout the day.
Progress: Perform this exercise lying on your back, cupping a ball in your hand,
and pressing the neck down into the ball. Perform the Neck Extensors Stretch.

Regress: Use a heating pad.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Review of Key Points
Self-myofascial release techniques are used at the outset of a client’s program to rejuvenate
and regenerate unhealthy muscles and fascia before moving on to stretching and strengthening exercises.
■■When introducing your client to a specific self-myofascial release technique, it is impor-

tant to explain why they are performing that exercise and to give them time to explore
the tight areas on their own.
■■Do not recommend SMR techniques that are impractical or require expensive equipment.
■■Regress an SMR technique if your client experiences pain or cannot perform the exer-

cise correctly.
■■Progress an SMR technique if your client no longer feels any tenderness on the target

area or if they have achieved the range of motion they need to progress to stretching
and strengthening.
■■There are a number of important contraindications to the application of self-myofascial

release techniques. These are listed in chapter 15, and you should review them carefully
before introducing these techniques into a client’s corrective exercise program.

Self-Check
It is important to select self-myofascial release exercises based on the specific needs of each
client. In this Self-Check, consider the client imbalance or situation described and identify
three appropriate self-myofascial release techniques that could be incorporated into each
client’s program. Provide a brief rationale to support your selections. An example is provided.

Client imbalance or situation

SMR exercise selection

Your assessment results reveal a client with an overpronated right foot, a valgus right knee, and right knee
pain.

Golf Ball Roll to rejuvenate and regenerate the structures
on the underside of the foot to help prepare the client for
strengthening exercises later in the program. Calf Massage
to increase dorsiflexion (effectively reducing overpronation and helping align the knee). Foam Roller on IT Band to
release the structures on the lateral side of the leg and knee
in preparation for strengthening the appropriate muscles to
help decelerate the knee as it moves toward the midline of
the body during activities like walking and running.

Your assessment results reveal a client with an anterior
pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and lower back
pain.

Your assessment results reveal a client with internally
rotated arms, excessive thoracic kyphosis, and pain
between the shoulder blades.
