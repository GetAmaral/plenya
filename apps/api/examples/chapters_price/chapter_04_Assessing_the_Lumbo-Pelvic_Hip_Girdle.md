## Chapter 4: Assessing the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

CHAPTER 4
Assessing the Lumbo-Pelvic
Hip Girdle
The lumbo-pelvic hip girdle is where the lumbar
spine, pelvis, and hips come together. The hips,
pelvis, and lower back are all very complex structures, and at the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle they create
an enormously intricate, integrated union of bones,
muscles, tendons, ligaments, fasciae, and nerves.
Humans are designed to stand and move about
on two legs. The lumbo-pelvic hip girdle is one of
the most important features of the body because
it provides the structure and support needed to
maintain an upright posture. In the lower back, the
lumbar portion of the spine features a lordotic curve,
which helps to lift the torso and to keep it adjusted
over the body’s center of gravity. The pelvis adjusts
to movements of the upper body and arms and communicates with the lower limbs to aid in propulsion,
transmit power, and maintain balance. Several large
muscle groups in the lumbo-pelvic hip region work
together to help move the lumbar spine, pelvis, and
hips in all three planes of motion with great amounts
of freedom. While this potential for movement is
wonderfully unique to humans, it also puts them at
risk of developing compensation patterns, movement
dysfunctions, and musculoskeletal imbalances in
this area of the body (Schamberger 2002).

BASIC ANATOMY
The main components of the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
are the lumbar spine, the sacrum, the sacroiliac
joints, the pelvis, the hip, and the acetabulum (see
figure 4.1).

The pelvis is a ringlike structure at the base of
the spine that is created by the fusion of the ilium,
ischium, and pubis bones. These fused bones form
either side of the pelvis and are referred to as the
left and right innominate bones, or more commonly,
the hip bones. The head of the femur (upper leg
bone) articulates with the pelvis at a deep socket
in the hip called the acetabulum. The pelvis also
articulates with the spine at the sacroiliac joints,
where the sacrum meets the ilium of the pelvis.
The sacrum is a triangular series of fused bones
at the base of the spine between the lumbar spine
and the coccyx (tailbone) (Dimon and Day 2008).
The lumbar spine is comprised of the five largest
vertebrae in the body and is responsible for helping

flex, side bend, extend, and rotate the spine (McGill
2016). Many muscles, tendons, and ligaments help
hold the structures of the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
together while providing for mobility and movement.

COMMON DEVIATIONS
There are two main deviations that cause pain,
injury and movement dysfunction in the lumbopelvic hip girdle (Solberg 2008):
■■An anterior pelvic tilt
■■Excessive lumbar lordosis

When a person is standing in perfect alignment,
the pelvis is naturally rotated anteriorly about 10
degrees (Gajdosik et al. 1985; Heino, Godges, and
Carter 1990). This means that the front of the pelvis
is slightly lower than the back of the pelvis. However,
if the pelvis is tilted more than this when standing,
the front of the pelvis is too far forward and down,
and the back of the pelvis rises too far upward. This
excessive forward and downward tilt of the pelvis
is called an anterior pelvic tilt (see figure 4.2).
Conversely, if the pelvis is too high at the front,
then the back of the pelvis will drop. A backward
tilt of the pelvis is called a posterior pelvic tilt. Since
the purpose of this text is to cover the most common
deviations you may encounter as a fitness professional, assessments and other information about the
posterior pelvic tilt will not be discussed.
When a person is standing in good alignment, the
lumbar spine in the lower back has a slight inward,
or lordotic, arch. This is a natural concave curve that

a

Figure 4.2

can be observed when a person is viewed in profile.
Excessive lumbar lordosis refers to an excessive
curvature (or overarching) of the lumbar spine (see
figure 4.3). Excessive lumbar lordosis is problematic
because it can lead to movement dysfunction and
eventually pain (Houglum 2016).
The lumbar spine, sacrum, and pelvis are linked
by the sacroiliac joint and the many strong ligaments that cross and support this joint. Therefore,
the position of the pelvis directly affects the position
of the sacrum and lumbar spine. Conversely, the
position of the lumbar spine and sacrum directly
affects the position of the pelvis. If the pelvis tilts
too far forward, the lumbar spine will arch excessively. Therefore, an anterior pelvic tilt is almost
always accompanied by excessive lumbar lordosis.
Similarly, excessive lumbar lordosis is almost always
accompanied by an anterior pelvic tilt (Solberg
2008).

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Having reviewed the structural anatomy of the
lumbo-pelvic hip girdle and the common imbalances
clients are likely to have in this area, we can now
proceed to the detailed assessment procedures.

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
When assessing the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, it is
important to learn how clients perceive their condition or pain, both in isolation and in relation to other
body areas and when performing activities (Price
and Bratcher 2010). Ask about the following topics,

b

Example of (a) normal pelvic tilt and (b) anterior pelvic tilt.


Assessing the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

Figure 4.3

Example of excessive lumbar
lordosis.

and write down any pertinent information on the
Client Assessment Diagram (CAD).
1. Ask if the client has ever experienced pain
in the hips, groin, buttocks, or lower back.
Encourage specific responses when the person
is describing the location and nature of the pain.
For example, is the pain on the side or front of
the hip? Is it deep in the groin or toward the top
of the leg, the top or middle of the buttocks, or
the seat of the buttocks? If it is at the base of
the spine, is it at the level of the sacroiliac joint
or on or near the tailbone? Is it a shooting or a
tingling pain? Does it run down the leg? Is there
pain in the abdomen? (Petty and Moore 2002).
If a client complains of pain on the side of the
hip, this may indicate that the leg is not moving
correctly in the hip socket, possibly leading to
inflammation. Specific clues like this can help
guide you toward further examination of the
alignment of the leg, hip, and pelvis (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
2. Ask whether the client has arthritis or any
other diagnosed conditions that may affect the
musculoskeletal health of the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle. For example, clients with a diagnosis of
disc degeneration may experience pain that
could affect the success of their corrective exercise programs (Cramer and Darby 2014). When
you know about conditions that may require
outside assistance or that are beyond your
scope of practice, you have an opportunity to
develop referral relationships with like-minded
professionals who can help ensure your clients’

long-term success (for more on scope of practice, networks, and referrals, see chapter 28).
3. Ask about the client’s past injuries and surgeries. For example, a hip replacement or a lumbar
fusion will affect both movement and function
(Petty and Moore 2002).
4. Ask about the client’s level of physical activity.
For example, it would be important to know if
a person plays sports or engages in activities
such as golf and tennis that put a lot of stress
on the hips and spine (Petty and Moore 2002).
5. Ask about the client’s occupation. For example,
if a person spends much of the day seated in hip
flexion with his lower back rounded, this may
adversely affect the function of his lumbo-pelvic
hip girdle (McGill 2016).
6. Ask the client whether his back or hip problems ever prevent him from engaging in an
activity or limit what he can do. This will help
you to understand his underlying motivation
for coming to see you and what he hopes to be
able to do after he has regained full function or
alleviated his pain (Price and Bratcher 2010).
7. Ask whether the client’s pain coincides with
any other pains or symptoms in other areas
of the body. This will help the client to understand the body’s interconnectedness and
may point to possible causes, compensations,
and corrections. For example, a client with
lower back pain who spends a lot of time at
the computer may reveal that when her lower
back hurts, her neck also hurts. You can take
this opportunity to highlight how her head
and neck position directly affects the position
of her lumbar spine (learn how the head and
neck relate to the rest of the body in chapter
6). You can then tell her that you will be taking
a closer look at the condition of her head and
neck later in the assessment process (Price
and Bratcher 2010).
8. Ask the client what aggravates the pain and
what makes it feel better (Petty and Moore
2002). For example, if a client indicates that sitting at work exacerbates his back pain, you can
coach him on how to improve his sitting posture
(see chapter 18, Static Postural Considerations)
to help address this problem.
9. Ask the client if the pain ever wakes him up
at night or if he has trouble sleeping because
of it. This is important because many lumbopelvic hip girdle issues are exacerbated by poor
sleeping posture (see chapter 18, Static Postural
Considerations) (Price and Bratcher 2010).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Once you have concluded the verbal portion of
the assessment process, move on to the visual and
hands-on assessments.

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENTS
When assessing the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, it is
important to have a clear view of the structures you
are evaluating. Ask the client to tuck in her shirt so
you can see the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hips clearly.

VISUAL ASSESSMENT FOR
ANTERIOR PELVIC TILT AND
EXCESSIVE LUMBAR LORDOSIS

While the client is still standing side-on, look at
the curvature of the lumbar spine to evaluate for
excessive lumbar lordosis. You should see a slight
curve, or concavity, in the lower back. However, if
the curve of the lower back looks markedly arched
(like a C or reverse C, depending on which way they
are facing), then the client is considered to have
excessive lumbar lordosis (see figure 4.5) (Boos
and Aebi 2008).

HANDS-ON ASSESSMENT FOR
THE LUMBO-PELVIC HIP GIRDLE

To visually assess whether a client has an anterior
pelvic tilt, ask her to stand in front of you facing sideways. Note how her pants or shorts sit on her hips,
and determine if the front of the waistband is lower
than the back. The front of the waistband typically
rests on the bony protuberance at the front of the
pelvis, the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). The
back of the waistband typically rests on the bony
protuberance at the back, the posterior superior iliac
spine (PSIS). As such, visually inspecting the client’s
waistband can provide insight into the position of
the pelvis. If the back of the pelvis appears much
higher than the front, this may suggest an anterior
pelvic tilt (see figure 4.4) (Palmer, Epler, and Epler
1998). On the other hand, if the back of the pelvis
appears lower than the front, this indicates that the
pelvis has rotated backward. However, most people
will have an anterior pelvic tilt.

Once the visual assessments for the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle are complete, begin the hands-on portion of
the assessment process. Tell the client that you will
now be manually evaluating his lower back in order
to confirm or refute your visual assessment findings.
You will be feeling for how much of a curve is in his
lower back. Remember to ask permission to touch a
client before performing any hands-on assessments.
To manually assess for the presence of excessive
lumbar lordosis, ask the client to stand barefoot
with his back, buttocks, heels, shoulders, and head
against a wall. Before you begin the assessment, you
must confirm that all of these structures are touching the wall. Then place your hand, palm down, on
the wall and slide it behind the client’s lower back
(see figure 4.6).
Now evaluate the space between the lower back
and the wall. With an acceptable degree of lumbar
lordosis, you should only be able to slide your fingers
behind the lower back up to and in line with about
your second knuckle. If the space between the back

Assessing the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

and the wall is large enough for you to slide your
whole hand or arm through, then the client has
excessive lumbar lordosis. The greater the space
is between the wall and the lower back, the more
extreme the deviation or imbalance (Price and
Bratcher 2010). The presence of excessive lumbar
lordosis will also indicate an anterior pelvic tilt
(Kendall, McCreary, and Provance 2005).
Note that if someone has very well-developed
gluteal muscles and the base of her spine is not in
contact with the wall during the assessment, it will
be necessary to make an allowance for the additional
space you will find. Use your best judgment to determine whether the lumbar curvature is excessive.
Go to the online video to watch video 4.1,
where Justin demonstrates a hands-on
assessment for excessive lumbar lordosis.

You can also assess for excessive lumbar lordosis
with the client in a supine position. Ask the client
to lie on the floor on his back with his legs straight.
Instruct him to keep his knees and toes pointed
toward the ceiling. Evaluate the arch in the lumbar
spine by sliding your hand under his lower back (see
figure 4.7). If you can slide all your fingers or your
entire hand into the space between his lower back
and the floor, this indicates he has excessive lumbar
lordosis (Ward 2016).
It may be difficult to conduct this assessment
accurately if the client has an excessive amount of
body fat around the midsection. In such cases the
excess flesh will fall toward the floor and may pre-

vent you from being able to slide your hand under
the lower back. Similarly, if you use a soft assessment
surface such as a massage table, the accuracy of the
assessment may be affected. If a client has severe
lower back pain, you should not ask her to lie on her
back with her legs straight because this may aggravate her condition. In such a case, this assessment
may be more effective to use as a teaching tool to
help the client understand how sleeping with her
legs straight may affect her lower back (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
As you finish the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle assessment process, you can help the client understand
how to achieve a neutral position for this area,
and you can explain how better lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle alignment can prevent pain and dysfunction
not only in the lower back and hips, but also in
the feet, ankles, knees, upper back, and shoulders
(learn how the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle relates to
the thoracic spine and shoulder girdle at the end
of this chapter).

TEACHING CLIENTS
NEUTRAL POSITION
OF THE LUMBO-PELVIC
HIP GIRDLE
Use the following strategies to teach your clients to
achieve and maintain a neutral position of the pelvis
and lumbar spine when they stand.
Instruct the client to stand upright, and place
the palms of her hands on the front of her pelvis
with her fingers straight. The centers of her palms
should rest on the bony protuberances on the front

Figure 4.7

of the pelvis just below the height of (and to the
sides of) the navel. Next, she should position her
hands so that her fingers are parallel to the floor
and close enough together so that the ends of her
index fingers and middle fingers are touching (see
figure 4.8). Finally, instruct her to look down so
that she can see her fingers. If she cannot clearly
see both her index fingers and her middle fingers,
the pelvis is probably rotated too far forward and
downward, putting her fingers out of view. Coach
her to tuck the pelvis under (i.e., tilt it posteriorly)
until she can see both her index and second fingers
clearly. At this point the pelvis will be in a relatively
neutral position (Price and Bratcher 2010).
After the client has completed the pelvis adjustment, ask her to stand with her back, buttocks,
shoulders, head, and heels touching a wall like
she did in the hands-on assessment described
previously. Coach her to tilt her pelvis to a neutral
position using the palms-on-pelvis technique. This
movement will help flatten the lower back to the
wall and decrease the excessive arch in the lumbar
spine. As she performs this movement, place your
hand behind her lower back so that both of you can

feel the space decrease. Coach her to keep tilting
her pelvis posteriorly until you can slide only about
the first two knuckles of your fingers into the space
between the lower back and the wall. As the client
tilts her pelvis, her knees should remain straight,
and her heels, buttocks, shoulders, and head should
remain in contact with the wall. This will result in
a relatively neutral position for the entire lumbopelvic hip girdle (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Some people may not be able to achieve neutral
alignment of the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle. This
usually happens in cases where a person has longterm alignment problems or lower back pain or is
severely overweight (Price and Bratcher 2010).
In such instances, coach clients to get as close to
neutral as possible so they can feel what it is like
(and what muscles and movements are involved)
to achieve better alignment.
Before you move on to the verbal, visual, and
hands-on assessments for the thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle, briefly sum up your findings about
the client’s lumbo-pelvic hip girdle. Make sure you
have completed the CAD for this area, and briefly
describe for the client how the lumbo-pelvic hip
region relates to the structures above and below
it (see the next section).

Figure 4.8

Palms-on-pelvis technique for
finding a neutral lumbo-pelvic
hip position.

In the chapters on assessing the feet, ankles, and
knees, you learned that overpronation of the foot
and ankle causes these structures to collapse
inward with the lower leg toward the midline of the
body. The movement of these structures, in turn,
also causes the knee to move toward the midline
and the upper leg to rotate inward. These positional changes in the feet, knees, and legs cause
the top of the upper leg to shift backward where
it attaches to the hip socket (see figure 4.9). Since
the pelvis houses the hip socket, it must also shift
out of alignment—that is, it rotates anteriorly. This

causes the lumbar spine to arch excessively (Price
and Bratcher 2010).
These compensatory shifts in the lower kinetic
chain also affect the position of the thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle (Kendall, McCreary, and Provance
2005). Overpronation, a valgus knee position, an
anterior pelvic tilt, and excessive lumbar lordosis are
all characterized by the feet, ankles, knees, pelvis,
and lumbar spine collapsing in and forward. These
movements shift the body’s center of gravity forward
from its optimal position, thereby causing the upper
body to tip forward (Whiting and Zernicke 2008).
This forward shift is marked by excessive thoracic
kyphosis, the thoracic spine rounding forward and
collapsing, the shoulder blades protracting forward
and elevating on the rib cage and the arms internally
rotating (Price and Bratcher 2010).
It is important that you understand these movement patterns and compensations and teach your
clients about the interrelatedness of the upper and
lower body. This will help you both to better understand the movement patterns and body positions
that may be exacerbating their condition or hampering their ability to perform effectively.

Assessment Checklist
Before you move on to assess the thoracic
spine and shoulder girdle, you must answer
the following questions about the lumbopelvic hip girdle:
❏ Do you know what type of pain the
client is experiencing and how it aﬀects
the function of her hips and lower back?

❏ Are other parts of the client’s body
aﬀected when her hips or lower back are
painful?
❏ Does the client have an anterior pelvic
tilt?
❏ Does the client have an excessive
curvature in her lumbar spine?

❏ Does the client have arthritis or any
diagnosed conditions that might aﬀect
the success of her program?

❏ Does the client know how to achieve
a neutral position for the pelvis when
standing?

❏ Does the client have any past injuries or
surgeries that might aﬀect the function
of her lumbo-pelvic hip girdle?

❏ Do you know how the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle relates to the lower kinetic chain
and thoracic spine and shoulder girdle,
and can you explain it to the client?

❏ What makes the client’s hips and back
feel better or worse?
❏ Does the client’s hip or lower back pain
limit her function in any way?
❏ Does the client’s hip or lower back pain
aﬀect her sleep?

Make all your notations for this part of
the assessment on the Client Assessment
Diagram (see figure 4.10 for an example).

Review of Key Points
The lumbo-pelvic hip girdle is the area where the upper half of the body connects to the
lower half. It is a multifaceted union of bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and fasciae that
enables humans to stand upright and move on two legs.
■■The two most common deviations found in the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle are

1. excessive lumbar lordosis and
2. an anterior pelvic tilt.
■■The pelvis is normally rotated anteriorly approximately 10 degrees. This slight forward

tilt enables the end of the upper leg to sit properly in the hip socket to enable smooth
articulation between the pelvis, lumbar spine, and legs. An excessive anterior pelvic tilt,
however, causes the hip socket to shift backward, thereby causing the upper leg to move
out of optimal alignment and affecting the positioning of the knees and feet.
■■An excessive anterior rotation of the pelvis is almost always accompanied by excessive

arching of the lower back. This happens because the lumbar spine and pelvis are linked
via the sacroiliac joint.
■■It is important to discover the types and intensity of physical activity that a client typi-

cally engages in so that you can understand how much stress he places on his lower back
and hips. Identifying activities that cause or relieve his pain can help you understand
what soft tissue structures may be irritated or dysfunctional.
■■The health and function of the feet, ankles, knees, and thoracic spine and shoulder girdle

are directly affected by malalignments in the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle.
■■Record any pertinent information on the Client Assessment Diagram.


Assessing the Lumbo-Pelvic Hip Girdle

Self-Check
Since the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle is where the upper and lower body connect, everything
above and below it are affected by deviations in this area. Stand in front of a mirror and
practice trying to tilt the back of your pelvis down to achieve a neutral position for your
lumbo-pelvic hip girdle.
As you bring your pelvis and lumbar spine into alignment, look for movements or compensations that occur in other parts of your body. For example, as you tilt your pelvis posteriorly,
you might notice your shoulders come forward away from the wall. This may happen because
you typically keep your torso upright by overarching your lower back, rather than using the
muscles of your upper back and shoulders to remain erect. When you take away this compensation pattern, you may find it hard to keep your shoulders against the wall. Examine
each body part, and record what you see or feel in the following chart.
