## Chapter 2: Assessing the Feet and Ankles

CHAPTER 2
Assessing the Feet and
Ankles
The foot and ankle complex is very complex indeed.
In one foot alone, there are 26 bones, 33 joints, and
over 100 ligaments, muscles, and tendons (Gray
1995). Two of the most important functions of the
feet and ankles are to keep the body balanced and
to ensure that stress is distributed correctly not only
through these structures but also throughout the
musculoskeletal system (Frowen et al. 2010; Kelikian
2011). If functioning of the foot and ankle complex is
compromised during weight-bearing activities, other
parts of the body have to compensate to preserve
balance, and existing imbalances elsewhere are
compounded. The feet and ankles must also adapt
to changes in surfaces and terrains (Frowen et al,
2010), so they are continually subjected to stresses
from both above and below.

and pressure and to adapt the body to the terrain or
contact surface (Snell 2008).
The three areas of the foot are known as the
hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot (figure 2.2).
The hindfoot, which includes the calcaneus (heel
bone), is below the ankle and helps absorb shock and
distribute forces. It also aids in the transfer of stress
through to the midfoot and forefoot. The midfoot,
which includes the bones in the middle of the foot
and is the highest part of the arches of the foot, is
also designed to absorb shock. The midfoot also
helps dissipate forces through side-to-side movement. The forefoot, which includes the metatarsals
and the toes, is very flexible; this flexibility serves

BASIC ANATOMY
The foot and ankle complex can be broken into six
parts, three joints of the ankle and three areas of the
foot. The joint where the lower leg bones (tibia and
fibula) come together at the ankle is the tibiofibular joint (figure 2.1). Below the tibia and fibula (and
above the talus) is the talocrural joint, also known
as the true ankle joint. This joint helps the lower
leg interact with the foot and ankle and displaces
stress downward through to the heel (Snell 2008).
The other main joint in the ankle is the subtalar
joint (below the talus bone). It helps transfer forces
forward through to the foot and has great side-toside movement capabilities to help distribute weight

to increase the surface area of the foot to improve
both balance and the body’s interactions with the
terrain (Davis, Davis and Ross 2005).
The areas of the foot can also interlock to slow
forces down as the foot comes in contact with the
ground. This reduces ankle rotation and prevents
the system of arches from completely collapsing
(Kelikian 2011; Snell 2008). This stabilization function is very important to reducing the risk of injury,
and it requires all areas of the foot to function
correctly. The foot also sends signals to the brain
about the terrain so that future interactions with the
ground can be predicted (Price and Bratcher 2010).
As you can see, the feet and ankles are very sophisticated structures, and they can bear a lot of stress.
Any injury or malalignment in these structures will
be amplified because they never entirely get to rest,
especially during weight-bearing activities. Therefore,
it is crucial that the foot and ankle complex are healthy
and aligned and functioning as well as possible.

COMMON DEVIATIONS
There are two main musculoskeletal deviations that
cause pain, injury, and movement dysfunction in the
foot and ankle area (Hertel 2002):
■ Overpronation
■ Lack of dorsiflexion

Pronation is a normal and necessary function
that occurs when the foot and ankle roll inward (and
forward) toward the midline of the body when the
foot makes contact with the terrain. This movement
causes the heel to roll inward (eversion), causes
the ankle to bend forward (dorsiflexion), causes
the lower leg to rotate inward, and causes the foot
to move outward slightly (abduction). These movements allow the body to transfer weight forward,
from side to side, and in rotation. Overpronation
occurs when the foot collapses or rolls too far inward
for normal function. This excessive movement
toward the inside of the body causes the heel and
ankle to fall inward, limiting the forward movement
of the foot and ankle and causing the arch along the
inside of the foot to flatten. It can also make the foot
turn too far out to compensate for the excessive
transfer of pressure toward the midline of the body
that occurs when the foot collapses (Hertel 2002;
Lowe 2009). While overpronation occurs at the foot
and ankle, it can disrupt movement throughout
the entire body (Kendall, McCreary and Provance
2005).
Dorsiflexion occurs at the ankle and is an essential component of pronation. It involves bringing
the lower leg over the foot (or vice versa), and it
occurs during all weight-bearing activities when
the foot is in contact with the ground. Examples
include the movement of the lower legs over the feet
when squatting, and swinging the leg forward and
lifting the foot to clear the ground when walking.
Overpronation causes the lower leg, ankle, and foot
to collapse in toward the midline of the body too
much. This limits proper forward movement of the
ankle and results in a lack of dorsiflexion (Hertel
2002). When people cannot dorsiflex through a
full range of motion, it impairs not only the foot
and ankle functions but other movements as well
(Cook 2010).
Go to the online video to watch video 2.1,
where Justin talks about common deviations
of the feet and ankles.

Common foot and ankle imbalances typically
occur together, meaning that a person who overpronates almost always lacks dorsiflexion. It is far
more common for people to overpronate than to
oversupinate. Since the aim of this text is to cover
the most common deviations you may see as a fitness
professional, oversupination will not be discussed.


Assessing the Feet and Ankles

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Having reviewed the structural anatomy of the feet
and ankles and the common imbalances clients may
have, we now move on to the detailed procedures
for assessing these areas of the body. As stated in
chapter 1, the foot and ankle assessment process
should begin with a verbal assessment.

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
When assessing the feet and ankles, it is important
to learn how clients perceive their condition or pain,
both in isolation and in relation to other body areas
and when performing activities (Price and Bratcher
2010). Ask about the following topics, and write down
any pertinent information on the Client Assessment
Diagram (CAD) as you conduct the assessment.
1. Ask if the client has ever experienced pain
in the feet or ankles, and ask for the specific
location of the pain (e.g., is it at the side or
front of the ankle, under the heel or the arch
of the foot, at the back of the foot on the Achilles tendon, in the toes or on top of the foot).
Encouraging verbal descriptions will help you
better understand the client and her individual
needs (Petty and Moore 2002). For example, if
a client has pain on the underside of her foot, it
may be a sign that her medial longitudinal arch
is stressed. This will prompt you to check for
signs of overpronation when you perform the
visual and hands-on assessments.
2. Ask if the client has arthritis or any other
diagnosed condition that may affect musculoskeletal health. This will help you not only to
understand the integrity of the joints and other
structures you are assessing, but also to identify
factors beyond your control that may affect the
success of a corrective exercise program. For
example, clients with severe arthritis may still
experience aches in the joint, even after you
have helped them address their musculoskeletal
imbalances. However, do not let a diagnosis of
arthritis discourage you from trying to help
clients reduce their pain and improve their
functional capabilities. Alignment is always the
key to reducing stress or pain in the joints, even
in cases of arthritis (Miller 1995).
3. Ask about the client’s past injuries or surgeries.
Note when the injury or surgery took place,
what part of the foot or ankle was affected,
the diagnosis (if any) that was made by a
licensed medical professional, and the name of

the physical therapist, doctor, or surgeon who
examined the injury or performed the surgery.
Gather as much information as possible so you
can follow up with the medical professional to
gain insight about how the injury or surgery
might affect the design, implementation, and
success of a corrective exercise program (Petty
and Moore 2002).
4. Ask about the client’s level of physical activity. Find out how often the person engages in
those activities, to what degree of intensity,
and for how long. This will help you understand
the types and amounts of stress clients place
on their bodies (Petty and Moore 2002). For
example, if a client with knee pain is an avid
runner and she plans to run the same number of
miles during her corrective exercise program,
this will directly affect her potential success.
5. Ask about the client’s job. This will help you
to understand the normal physical stresses he
experiences (Petty and Moore 2002). A postal
carrier will have more stress on his feet and
ankles than a computer technician.
6. Ask the client whether her feet or ankles ever
prevent her from engaging in an activity or
limits what she can do. The answer to this question will help you to understand the underlying
motivation for why the client has come to see
you (Price and Bratcher 2010). If foot pain is
preventing a client from playing tennis, for
example, then knowing this from the outset
will enable you to relate the benefit of certain
exercises to how she can get back to playing
tennis if she adheres to the program.
7. Ask if the client’s ankle or foot pain coincides
with any other pains or symptoms in the body.
This will help you to establish causal links
between symptoms and activities or circumstances. It also gets clients thinking about
how problems in the body can be related. For
example, if a client is complaining of ankle
pain but also notices that his back hurts when
his ankle hurts, then he will be more likely to
perform the exercises you design to help align
his hips and lower back, knowing that this will
also help his ankle feel better.
8. Ask the client what aggravates her condition
and what makes it feel better. This will help
you to establish the source of the pain. For
example, if a client’s back pain is worse in the
morning, it might be a good idea to evaluate
her sleeping position (Petty and Moore 2002).
If her pain feels better after she performs an

11

exercise that she learned in the past, you have
the opportunity to review her technique, gather
additional clues about a potential cause, and
praise her successful adaptation of this beneficial exercise.
Once you have concluded the verbal portion of
the assessment, ask the client to remove his shoes
and socks for the visual and hands-on assessments.

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENT
The visual and hands-on portion of the assessment
process is used to gain additional information about
the condition of a client’s feet and ankles. It is also
used to confirm or challenge assumptions you might
have made during the verbal assessment.

VISUAL ASSESSMENTS
Begin the visual portion of the assessment by asking
the client to stand in front of you and facing you.
Explain that you will be carefully looking at the
condition of his feet and ankles. Specifically, you will
be looking for any swelling, calluses, or irregularities
between the feet, ankles, and toes.

Evaluate for Overpronation
In order to visually determine the extent and type
of pronation in a client’s feet, make sure the client
is standing on both feet and facing you. Look at the
area that runs along the inside of each foot. If the
arch is dropped or absent or if a bulge of flesh sticks
out on the inside of one or both of the client’s feet,
this indicates that the client overpronates (see figure
2.3) (Schamberger 2002).

Figure 2.3

Absence of inside arch and
ankles rolled inward indicate an
overpronated foot position.

Evaluate for Foot Abduction or Adduction
With the client still standing in front of you, check
the position of his feet. Note whether one or both feet
are facing forward, if one or both feet are adducted
(turned inward “like a pigeon”), or if one or both feet
are abducted (turned outward “like a duck”) from
the midline of the body (see figure 2.4). An abducted
or adducted position of the feet may indicate overpronation (Schamberger 2002). For example, a client
with an overpronated foot may also abduct her foot
when standing because overpronation produces an
internal rotation of the lower leg, which causes the
knee to turn toward the midline of the body. As a
result, she may turn her foot outward to realign the
knee to face forward (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Most people who overpronate will abduct rather
than adduct their feet. Occasionally, though, you
may come across a client who adducts (i.e., turns
in) one foot. This problem is usually also caused
by overpronation. As previously discussed, when a
person overpronates, the foot and ankle move toward
the midline of the body. This causes the knee to also
move toward the midline. To compensate for this
change in knee position, the person will turn the foot
outward so that the knee faces forward. However, in
clients who are bowlegged or have another congenital condition that affects the alignment and position
of their legs, their knees may actually be oriented
toward the outside of the body. These clients may
overpronate, but they may also turn their feet inward
to make their knees face forward.

Check the Big Toes
Calluses, bunions, and crooked toes may also be
evidence of common musculoskeletal imbalances in

Figure 2.4

Example of abducted foot position.


Assessing the Feet and Ankles

the feet and ankles, so it is important to ascertain
the condition of the client’s toes (Arnot 2003). Look
at the big toe of each foot to determine if the first
joint of that toe is swollen, has a bunion, or looks as
though it points away from the midline rather than
straight ahead (see figure 2.5). If the big toe on one
or both feet is not straight, this may indicate that the
client overpronates. When a person overpronates,
the foot collapses and weight is transferred toward
the centerline of the body. This transfer of weight
across the foot before it can pass over the end of the
big toe can cause any of the following: irritation on
the inside of the big toe (e.g., a callus), inflammation
and additional bone growth on the first joint of the
big toe (a bunion), or a shift of the big toe toward
the other toes (hallux valgus).

Figure 2.6

HANDS-ON ASSESSMENTS

Check the Lesser Toes

Once the visual assessments for the feet and ankles
are complete, begin the hands-on portion of the
assessment process. Tell the client that you will now
be manually evaluating his feet and ankles in order
to confirm or refute your visual assessment findings.
You will be looking for any irregular joint positions
in the ankle and excessive tension in the soft tissue
structures of the feet and lower legs. Remember to
always ask permission before touching a client or
performing any hands-on assessments.

The term lesser toes refers to all toes but the big
toes. Structural imbalances of the feet and ankles
and certain types of footwear can cause many
abnormalities in the lesser toes. These irregularities
are often called hammertoes, claw toes, or mallet
toes, and they can be very painful (see figure 2.6)
(Arnot 2003). To assess a client for these issues,
look at the lesser toes to see if they curl up, form a
claw, or look as though they are always flexed. Visual
abnormalities of the lesser toes may be an indication
that the client overpronates because weight is no
longer passing correctly over the forefoot and the
ends of the toes.

Evaluate the Position of the Talus Bone

where Justin demonstrates the visual assessments for overpronation.

lesser toes.

The talus bone, which is located in the ankle just
below the lower leg bones, helps dissipate some of
the side-to-side stresses in the foot and ankle during
weight-bearing activities. Evaluating the position
of the talus bone will help confirm whether a client
overpronates and to what extent (Muscolino 2009).
To assess the position of the talus bone, ask the
client to stand facing you with both feet straight and
pointed forward. Kneel down and place the thumb
and index finger of your right hand on either side
of the client’s left ankle just below the anklebones
(malleolus). You will feel a dimple or indentation on
both sides of the ankle. On the inside of the ankle,
the dimple is just below and behind the large tendon
of the tibialis anterior, the muscle that pulls the foot
toward the shin. On the outside of the ankle, the
dimple is just below and behind the tendon of the
extensor digitorum longus, the muscle that lifts the
lesser toes toward the shin (Gray 1995).
When you first begin practicing this assessment,
you will find it easier to locate these dimples by asking
clients to roll the weight on the foot to the outside
(i.e., to supinate) and to pull the foot and the big toe
upward using the muscles in the front of the shin.

13

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

This will help expose the tendon on the inside of the
ankle and highlight the dimpled area where you will
place your thumb (see figure 2.7a). Once you have
located this position, ask your client to pronate (i.e.,
roll the weight on the foot to the inside) and pull the
lesser toes upward using the muscles in the shin. This
will help expose the tendons of the lesser toes on the
outside of the ankle and will highlight the dimpled
area where you will place your index finger (see figure
2.7b) (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Position your thumb and forefinger and press
firmly in the center of the dimples on the inside and
outside of the ankle (see figure 2.8). Then ask the
client to roll the ankle from side to side in order to
raise and lower the arch of the foot (supinate and
pronate). As the client rolls the ankle inward, you
will feel pressure under your thumb on the inside of
the ankle. This is the talus bone pushing into your
thumb. As she rolls the ankle outward, you will feel
pressure under your forefinger. This is the talus
bone moving the other way. Coach your clients to
slowly roll the ankle in and out, and stop them in the

position when the pressure under your thumb and
forefinger feels even.
When you feel even pressure under your thumb
and forefinger, instruct your client to hold the foot
and ankle in that position. This is the neutral position for the talus bone and the correct position for
the foot and ankle in an upright standing position
(Magee and Sueki 2011). If the person you are assessing habitually overpronates, then a neutral foot and
ankle position will likely feel awkward, as though the
weight were all on the outside of the foot. Reassure
these clients that it is normal to feel that way because
their feet and ankles are used to collapsing under
the weight of the body rather than supporting and
transferring it correctly.
Now switch hands and use your left thumb and
forefinger to assess the position of the talus bone on
the client’s right foot.

Assessing the Feet and Ankles

Once the assessment is done, teach clients visually and kinesthetically how to find the neutral
position so they can see and feel what it is like to
stand with their feet and ankles in alignment. Teaching them to evaluate themselves enables them to
achieve this position on their own. They might even
communicate the technique to a friend, colleague,
or family member, which could result in another
person seeking your help to design a corrective
exercise program.

excessive muscle tension. If you are unsure whether
what you are feeling is a tight or tender spot, ask
the client to tell you what she is feeling when you
squeeze the calf. Repeat the assessment on the other
leg. Make a note of any findings, including tenderness, on the CAD.

Evaluate the Condition of the Plantar
Fascia

Musculoskeletal imbalances in the feet and ankles
will adversely affect the calf muscles (Kendall,
McCreary and Provance 2005). As the foot overpronates, the heel rolls inward, pulling on the Achilles
tendon and on the gastrocnemius and soleus, the
calf muscles on the back of the lower leg that attach
to the heel via that tendon. This excessive pulling
causes these muscles to become sore and to lose
their flexibility. If these muscles cannot lengthen
effectively, then the foot and ankle will not be able to
dorsiflex well. This lack of dorsiflexion can compress
the structures at the front of the ankle and cause
inflammation and irritation of the Achilles tendon
(Barnes 1999).
Ask the client to lie down on the floor on her back
with her knees bent. Kneel beside the client with
one leg forward and lift the lower part of one of the
client’s legs. Rest the client’s foot on your knee and
use your thumb and forefinger to squeeze the belly
of the client’s calf muscle (see figure 2.9). You are
looking for the presence of trigger points, nodules, or

The plantar fascia is a broad, dense, fairly rigid connective tissue that runs the length of the underside
of the foot. Forces from the body above and ground
reaction forces from below put enormous stress on
the plantar surface of the foot during weight-bearing
activities such as walking and running (Hyde and
Gegenbach 2007). Musculoskeletal imbalances, such
as overpronation and lack of dorsiflexion, increase
stresses on the plantar fascia. Over time, these can
cause the tissue to become overstressed, dysfunctional, and painful (Snell 2008).
To assess the condition of the plantar fascia, ask
the client to lie down on the floor on her back with
her knees bent. Kneel beside the client with one leg
forward and lift the lower part of one of the client’s
legs. Rest the client’s foot on your knee and press
your thumbs or fingers into the arches and sole of
each of her feet from the heel to the toes (see figure
2.10). Note any tenderness or painful areas, and
record them on the CAD. If you are not sure whether
you are feeling a tight or tender spot, ask for the client’s feedback. The sorest spot for most people will
usually be just forward of the heel at the highest
part of the arch or just behind the first joint of the
big toe (Hobrough 2016).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

By the end of the foot and ankle assessment, you will
have been able to help your clients understand any
musculoskeletal imbalances in these areas as well
as explain how those imbalances affect their knees.
While the assessments you have just completed can
reveal specific issues in the feet and ankles, they
also begin to demonstrate the interconnectedness
of all of the body’s parts. This is important because
it helps clients to understand that the site of their
pain or dysfunction is not always the source of their
problem. Therefore, before progressing to the verbal,
visual, and hands-on assessments for the knees,
briefly sum up your findings about the client’s feet
and ankles. Make sure you have completed the CAD
for this body area, and briefly describe how the feet
and ankles relate to the knees (see How the Feet
and Ankles Relate to the Knees). Communicating
this information to your clients will also help you
to move seamlessly into the next part of the assessment process.

HOW THE FEET AND
ANKLES RELATE TO
THE KNEES
The feet and ankles form the foundation of the human
body. As with any structure, the integrity of the foundation affects everything above it, and the weight
above has a direct impact on the foundation. Therefore, the condition of the feet and ankles will influence
the performance of all weight-bearing activities, such
as standing, bending, reaching, squatting, walking,
running, and lunging (Schamberger 2002).
When the foot overpronates, it causes the lower
leg to roll inward and the heel bone to collapse
toward the midline of the body. This collapsing
inward of the foot, ankle, and lower leg results in
a lack of dorsiflexion—that is, the foot, ankle, and
lower leg do not come forward over the foot correctly. Simply put, if the foot and ankle collapse in
too much, they cannot come forward enough. Since
the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles are attached
to the heel bone, this collapsing of the foot and ankle
affects the function of these muscles and further
limits dorsiflexion (Lowe 2009).

Figure 2.11

Valgus knee position.

The internal movement of the lower leg caused by
overpronation also affects the position of the knee,
since the bottom of the knee joint sits directly atop
the tibia and fibula. Overpronation causes a valgus
knee position, that is, an inward displacement of
the knee (see figure 2.11) (Johnson and Pedowitz
2007). Excessive inward movement or displacement
of the knee joint can result in tracking problems in
which the kneecap does not glide smoothly over the
femoral groove as it should (Johnson and Pedowitz
2007).
Lack of dorsiflexion in the ankle also directly
affects the function of the knee when it is both bending (flexing) and straightening (extending). For
example, many weight-bearing activities like squatting and lunging require the ankle to bend forward
at the same time the knee is bending (figure 2.12).
Other weight-bearing activities like walking and
running require the ankle to bend forward while
the knee is straightening (figure 2.13). However, if
the foot and ankle complex lacks dorsiflexion, the
knee joint must compensate for this lack of movement in the ankle, and pain and injury can result
(Cook 2010).

Review of Key Points
Musculoskeletal imbalances in the feet and ankles can be greatly intensified by forces transferred both from above and below.
■■The two most common deviations of the feet and ankles are

1. overpronation and
2. lack of dorsiflexion.
■■Calluses or bunions on or around the big toe, or a big toe that has moved away from the

midline of the body toward the lesser toes, may be visual clues that a person overpronates.
■■Overpronation is far more common than oversupination. Even a foot with an apparent

“high arch” can be overpronated. Therefore, you must perform the hands-on assessment
of the talus bone; you cannot rely solely on visual clues.
■■Determine your clients’ level and type of physical activity in order to understand the

amount of stress they place on their feet and ankles. This information, in addition to
identifying what activities cause or alleviate pain, can help you to determine what soft
tissue structures may be involved.
■■Overpronation contributes to a reduced ability to dorsiflex because as the foot and ankle

collapse inward too much, they lose their ability to come forward enough. This also
causes the calf muscles to lose their ability to function through a full range of movement.
■■Structural deviations in the feet and ankles directly affect the alignment and function

of the knees.
■■Record any pertinent information on the Client Assessment Diagram.
