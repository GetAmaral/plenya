# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 3: Assessing the Knees

CHAPTER 3
Assessing the Knees
The knee is a relatively simple structure whose
movement is fairly limited when compared to the
other joints of the body. The primary functions of the
knee are flexion and extension and linking the upper
leg to the lower leg to allow kinetic chain movements.
The knee can also move in small degrees of rotation
and very minimally from side to side (Hyde and
Gengenbach 2007).
The structural integrity of the knees can be compromised when the feet and ankles and the lumbopelvic hip girdle are not working correctly. This is
because the muscles that help stabilize the knees
have origins and insertions in these two areas (Price
and Bratcher 2010). Consequently, musculoskeletal
issues in the feet and ankles or in the lumbo-pelvic

hip girdle can result in the knees bearing the brunt
of imbalances in structures above or below them.

BASIC ANATOMY
The main components of the knee joint are the
femur, tibia, fibula, patella, menisci, quadriceps
tendon, patellar ligament, collateral ligaments (see
figure 3.1), and cruciate ligaments (see figure 3.2).
The patella (kneecap) is a small bone in the
center of the knee. It is attached to the quadriceps
muscles of the thigh via the quadriceps tendon.
As the quadriceps tendon passes over the patella,
it morphs into the patellar ligament, which then
attaches the patella to the tibia of the lower leg.

(The fibula is located beside the tibia on the lateral
side of the lower leg.) The correct alignment of the
femur (upper leg bone) and tibia allows the patella
to glide smoothly over the femoral groove at the
bottom of the femur (Dimon and Day 2008).
Two C-shaped discs called menisci (singular
meniscus) lie between the femur and the tibia. The
menisci are made from cartilage and act as shock
absorbers between the bones of the upper leg and
the lower leg (Dimon and Day 2008).
The medial and lateral collateral ligaments are on
either side of the knee joint. The medial collateral
ligament acts as a guide rope between the tibia
and femur, and the lateral collateral ligament
acts as a guide rope between the fibula and femur
to give side-to-side stability to the knee (Hyde and
Gengenbach 2007).
The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are located inside the knee joint; they attach
diagonally to the femur and the tibia. The cruciate
ligaments provide stability and minimize rotational
stress across the knee joint. They also prevent excessive forward or backward movement of the tibia in
relation to the femur (Hyde and Gengenbach 2007).

COMMON DEVIATIONS
There are two main deviations that can cause pain,
injury, and movement dysfunction in the knee area
(Hamel and Knutzen 2003):
■■Problems with side-to-side alignment (e.g., a

valgus knee)
■■Tracking problems during flexion and extension

Side-to-side alignment refers to the alignment
of the femur and tibia and the movement and position of these bones in relation to the centerline of
the body. Side-to-side alignment problems can occur
when the knee collapses in toward the midline of the
body (a valgus position) or toward the outside of the
body (a varus position); in these cases the muscles
and soft tissue structures cannot properly manage
forces on the knee joint. The most common side-toside alignment imbalance is a valgus position of one
or both knees (Hamel and Knutzen 2003). Over time,
this condition can cause the kneecap to be pulled
laterally so that it no longer moves correctly over
the femoral groove. Side-to-side alignment problems
typically disrupt function when a person is engaged
in dynamic, weight-bearing movements, such as
walking, running, squatting, lunging, or going up
and down stairs. However, chronic or severe sideto-side alignment issues can also manifest during
static activities, such as standing.

Tracking problems of the knee during flexion
and extension can occur when the kneecap does
not glide smoothly over the bottom of the femur
(femoral groove) as it should when the knee bends
and straightens. Tracking problems place an abnormal amount of pressure on the underside of the
kneecap. Over time, this excessive pressure can
cause inflammation and irritation, resulting in pain
and dysfunction (Hamel and Knutzen 2003). When
the knee bends and straightens (i.e., moves in the
sagittal plane), the thighbone above the knee and
the tibia and fibula below the knee also move from
side to side and rotate to some extent. Therefore,
tracking problems during flexion and extension
also affect movements in the frontal and transverse
planes—that is, from side to side and in rotation.

ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Having reviewed the structural anatomy and
common imbalances of the knees, we now turn to
the detailed assessment procedures.

VERBAL ASSESSMENT
It is important to learn how clients perceive their
condition or pain, both in isolation and in relation to other body areas and activities (Price and
Bratcher 2010). Ask about the following topics, and
write down any pertinent information on the Client
Assessment Diagram (CAD).
1. Ask whether the client has ever experienced
knee pain, and ask for the specific location of
the pain (Petty and Moore 2002). For example,
if the pain is on the medial side of the knee, it
may mean that this side is being stressed by
the way the client moves, possibly indicating
a valgus knee displacement. This will prompt
you to check for this imbalance as you move
into the visual and hands-on portion of the
assessment process.
2. Ask whether the client has arthritis or any
other diagnosed condition that may affect the
musculoskeletal health of her knees.
3. Ask the client about any past injuries or surgeries. Note when the injury or surgery took
place, what was done, the diagnoses, and the
name(s) of medical practitioners involved. A
procedure such as a total knee replacement
will affect both movement and function (Petty
and Moore 2002).
4. Ask about the client’s level of physical activity.
For example, it would be important to know


Assessing the Knees

if the person you are assessing plays sports
or runs often. This will help you to gauge the
amount of stress he places on his knees during a
typical day or week, and it will help you understand whether his knees will be able to rest and
recover during a corrective exercise program
(Petty and Moore 2002).
5. Ask about the client’s occupation (Petty and
Moore 2002). It would be important to know
if someone is a gardener or a carpet layer who
kneels all day long. Kneeling can put a lot of
stress on the kneecap. Over time, this could
affect the correct functioning of the knee and
the ultimate success of a corrective exercise
program.
6. Ask the client whether her knees ever prevent
her from engaging in an activity or limit what
she can do. This will help you to understand
why she has come to see you and what she
hopes to be able to do after she has regained
full function or alleviated her pain (Price and
Bratcher 2010).
7. Ask whether the client’s knee pain occurs with
any other pains or symptoms. This will help the
client to understand the body’s interconnectedness and will promote adherence to a corrective
exercise program (Price and Bratcher 2010).
For example, if a client notices that her knee
hurts only when she wears a particular pair of
shoes, you can use this opportunity to educate
her about how foot and ankle movements affect
her knees and coach her to choose more appropriate footwear (see Footwear and the Role of
Orthotics in chapter 18).
8. Ask the client what aggravates his condition
and what makes it feel better. This will help him
understand how daily activities can affect the
success of his program (Petty and Moore 2002).
For example, if riding his bicycle aggravates a
client’s knees, you can use this opportunity to
evaluate the height of his bicycle seat. You may
find that raising the seat helps decrease knee
flexion reducing stress to his knee.

up their pant legs to reveal the knees and to remain
barefooted (following their foot and ankle assessment). Remember to ask permission to touch a client
before performing any hands-on assessments.

VISUAL ASSESSMENTS
Begin the assessment by asking the client to stand
facing you with her feet hip width apart. Look for
swelling on or around the knee(s), and identify any
other irregularities, such as muscle size differences
and scarring (see figure 3.3) (Magee, Zachazewski,
and Quillen 2009). Make a note of any abnormalities
on the CAD.
Next, assess for side-to-side alignment. This
involves two steps. The first is a static visual evaluation of the position of the center of the kneecap.
The second step is a visual evaluation of the center
of the kneecap in a dynamic situation, such as during
a single-leg squat.
To assess the kneecap in a static position, look at
the middle of the client’s knee while she is standing
in front of you. Draw an imaginary line from the
kneecap to the middle of the ankle. Draw another
imaginary line from the kneecap to the center of the

Once you have concluded the verbal portion of
the assessment process, move on to the visual and
hands-on assessments.

VISUAL AND HANDS-ON
ASSESSMENTS
When assessing the knees, you must have a clear
view of the structures you are evaluating. Clients
who are not wearing shorts should be asked to pull

are visual irregularities.

front of the client’s upper leg (where the quadriceps
muscles originate). Note whether the intersection
of the two lines at the kneecap deviates too far in
or out (see figure 3.4) (Hamel and Knutzen 2003).
The thighbone is naturally angled inward toward
the knee. Therefore, the knee joint should be positioned closer to the midline than the center of the hip.
This angle of the thighbone in relation to the center of
the knee, called the Q angle, is quantified in degrees
(see figure 3.5). A Q angle in males of more than
approximately 15 degrees is considered abnormal,
and a Q angle of more than 18 degrees in females is
also considered abnormal (a greater angle is allowed
in females due to their wider hips) (Fernandez des-laPenas, Cleland, and Dommerholt 2016; Frisch 1994).
Remember that the purpose of this visual assessment
is simply to gauge whether a client’s knees appear to
deviate excessively inward or outward. The precise Q
angle is not vital to this assessment, so the technical
protocols for measuring it will not be discussed.
To visually assess the kneecap in a dynamic
setting, ask the client to stand on one leg facing
you. While the client is in this position, ask her to
perform a shallow squat, bending the knee of the
standing leg to approximately 30 degrees. As she
moves, watch the center of her kneecap, and note
whether it moves excessively toward or away from
the centerline of her body. It is normal for the knee
to move toward the midline of the body as a person
squats. In this assessment you are looking for excessive or uncontrolled motion of the knee toward the
midline, as shown in figure 3.6.

HANDS-ON ASSESSMENTS
Once the visual assessments for the knees are complete, begin the hands-on portion of the assessment
process. Tell the client that you will now be manually
evaluating her knees in order to confirm or refute
your visual assessment findings. You will be feeling
for unusual movements and listening for any irregular sounds as you bend and straighten the knee joint.
Ask the client to lie on the ground on her back.
Kneel beside her and coach her to bend one knee.

Figure 3.4

Do not ask clients with severe knee pain to do a
single-leg squat. This will add stress to the knee, and
it may make their condition worse. Simply perform
the static visual assessment to get an idea of the
placement of the center of the kneecap.
You can also visually assess the knee for sideto-side alignment problems from behind. Ask the
client to stand on one leg facing away from you and
to squat to about 30 degrees. Watch the center of
the buttock or the sit bone (ischial tuberosity) as
she performs this movement. Ideally, as the client
squats, the center of her gluteus maximus muscle
should lower down just to the side of the center of her
heel. There may be an indication of knee alignment
problems if the glutes and hip move excessively in a
swishing “salsa dance hip” movement away from the
centerline of the body (see figure 3.7). If this does
happen, the knee will usually move disproportionately toward the centerline to compensate (McLester
and St. Pierre 2008).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Place one hand on the client’s kneecap and use
your other hand to bend and straighten the leg two
to three times (see figure 3.8). Do not press down
excessively on either the kneecap or the lower leg
as you perform this assessment. As you bend and
straighten the leg, feel the kneecap as it glides over
the bottom of the upper leg. If you hear or feel any
grinding, crunching, cracking, or popping, then
there is probably a tracking issue (Frisch 1994).
If the client experiences pain of any kind, stop the
assessment immediately.
As you finish the knee assessment process, you
can help the client understand how to achieve a
neutral position for the knee and explain how better
knee alignment can prevent pain and dysfunction
not only in the knee itself, but also in the feet and
ankles or in the lumbo-pelvic hip area.

TEACHING CLIENTS
NEUTRAL POSITION OF
THE KNEE
Teaching clients to achieve a neutral position for
the knee when standing can help them to better
understand how the parts of the body affect each
other. Begin by instructing the client to try to attain
a neutral foot and ankle position using the technique
described in chapter 2 (Evaluate the Position of the
Talus Bone). When this position is achieved, the
knees should naturally align so that the centers of
the client’s kneecaps are in line with the second
toes (Clippinger 2016). Coach the client to feel what
happens to the gluteal muscles as they contract

to rotate the upper and lower leg outward into a
more neutral position. You can further help a client
align his knees by coaching him to posteriorly tilt
his pelvis (i.e., tuck it under) so that the curvature
decreases in the lumbar spine. Posteriorly tilting the
pelvis will also externally rotate the upper and lower
leg, which will also help align the foot and ankle
(Kendall, McCreary, and Provance 2005).
Sometimes, a person may not be able to achieve
perfect knee-to-foot-and-ankle alignment. This usually happens when the client has severe or long-term
alignment problems, bow legs, or another congenital
abnormality (Price and Bratcher 2010). Coach these
clients to get as close to neutral in the foot, ankle,
and knee as possible so that they can feel what it is
like (and what muscles and movements are involved)
to achieve better alignment.
Before progressing to the verbal, visual, and
hands-on assessments for the lumbo-pelvic hip
girdle, concisely sum up your findings about the client’s knees. Make sure you have completed the CAD
for this area, and briefly describe for the client how
the knees relate to the structures above and below
them (see the next section).

HOW THE KNEES RELATE
TO THE FEET AND ANKLES
AND THE LUMBO-PELVIC
HIP GIRDLE
The knee is the structure that bridges the feet and
ankles and the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle. Therefore,
any imbalances or malalignments in the structures


Assessing the Knees

above or below it will directly affect how the knee
feels and functions. For example, during the singleleg squat assessment, you should have noticed that
a valgus knee is usually accompanied by overpronation of the foot and ankle complex. This is because
as the foot and ankle collapse toward the midline
during overpronation, the lower leg also rotates
inward excessively, pulling the knee into a valgus
position. This movement of the knee also causes the
thighbone to rotate inward, affecting the position of
the hip socket (where the upper leg articulates with
the pelvis). Because of this change in position of the
upper leg and hip socket, the pelvis shifts out of alignment by rotating down and forward. This change in
position of the pelvis causes the lower back to arch
excessively (see figure 3.9) (Kendall, McCreary, and
Provance 2005; Price and Bratcher 2010).

ankles relate to the knees and lumbo-pelvic
hip girdle.

Assessment Checklist
Before you move on to assess the lumbopelvic hip girdle, you must answer the
following questions about the knees:
❏ Do you know what type of pain the
client is experiencing and how it aﬀects
the function of her knees?

❏ Are there any visual irregularities
between the client’s knees?
❏ Does the client have a valgus position in
one or both knees?
❏ Are there any problems with the client’s
kneecap tracking?

❏ Does the client have arthritis or any
diagnosed conditions that might aﬀect
the success of her program?

❏ Does the client know how to achieve
a neutral knee and foot position when
standing?

❏ What makes the client’s knees feel
better or worse?

❏ Do you know how the foot and ankle and
lumbo-pelvic hip girdle relate to the knees,
and can you explain it to your client?

❏ Does the client’s knee pain limit her
function in any way?
❏ Are other parts of the client’s body
aﬀected when her knees are painful?

Make all your notations for this part of
the assessment on the Client Assessment
Diagram (see figure 3.10 for an example).

Review of Key Points
The knee joint is primarily a hinge joint that connects the lower leg and the upper leg.
Malalignments or imbalances in the more mobile joints of the feet and ankles or the lumbopelvic hip girdle will affect their connection point, the knees.
■■The two most common deviations found in the knees are

1. problems with side-to-side alignment (e.g., valgus knee position) and
2. tracking problems during flexion and extension.
■■Apart from instances of acute trauma, knee pain is usually caused by imbalances in the

structures above and below the knee joint. Therefore, the overall health and function
of the feet and ankles and the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle directly affect the condition of
the knees.
■■Placing the feet and ankles into a neutral position when standing will most likely bring

the knees into proper alignment. Overpronation of the feet and ankles causes the lower
and upper leg to rotate too far inward, moving the knee toward the midline.
■■When you learn about the types and intensity of physical activity people engage in, you

can better understand the amount of stress they place on their knees. Identifying the
activities that cause or reduce pain can help you determine what soft tissue structures
may be irritated or dysfunctional.
■■Popping or grinding noises that occur when a person sits down, stands up, or otherwise

flexes and extends the knee suggest tracking problems.
■■Record any pertinent information on the Client Assessment Diagram.


Assessing the Knees

Self-Check

Kneecap nearly aligned over middle of second toe when standing; moderate
amount of movement toward the midline of knee when squatting; little or no pain;
popping or grinding during flexion/extension is minimal

Grade C

Kneecap not aligned over second toe when standing, but can be when in neutral
foot/ankle position; a little too much movement toward the midline of knee when
squatting; occasional pain; slight popping or grinding during flexion/extension

Grade D

Kneecap not aligned over second toe when standing; find it difficult to bring it into
alignment/achieve/maintain neutral foot and ankle position; knee is noticeably
shifted toward the middle of body when standing still and squatting; frequent or
