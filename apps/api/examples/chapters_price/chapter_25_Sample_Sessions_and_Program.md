# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 25: Sample Sessions and Program

CHAPTER 25
Sample Sessions
and Program
In this chapter you will learn how your program
design skills can be applied in a comprehensive case
study. You will meet a client who enrolled in a program of corrective exercise with The BioMechanics
Method to help her overcome chronic back pain and
recurring shoulder pain so she could return to the
activities she enjoys.
This case study includes a summary of the information that was gathered during the client’s initial
consultation, her completed Client Assessment
Diagram, and the homework exercises given during
her first five sessions. After the description of each
session, there is a detailed explanation for why each
technique was included.

CLIENT BACKGROUND
INFORMATION
Marion Hurst (name changed) is 60 years old and
has experienced chronic lower back pain for the last
three years. Her back pain is at its worst when she first
gets out of bed in the morning and has to bend over
to pick up the bowls to feed her dogs. As the morning progresses and she gets ready for work, her back
loosens up. Marion has a sedentary job as an executive
in an office. When she stands up at work after sitting
for long periods of time, her back tightens up again.
This causes her to become tired during the day, and
she always feels exhausted when she gets home in the
evening. As part of her job, Marion also has to attend
many social functions where she must stand for long

periods of time. This prolonged standing also irritates
her lower back. Marion finds the pain frustrating and
sometimes creates excuses to get out of these social
functions. Marion believes that she should wear highheeled shoes to work and to all social gatherings to
maintain a professional appearance.
During her free time, Marion likes to play golf
two to three times a week. Her back pain is always
worse in the evening after playing golf, and she also
experiences more aches and pains the following
morning. She also likes to go for long walks with
her husband on weekends. However, typically after
a couple of miles her back tightens up so much
that she has to stop the walk. She finds this very
frustrating because the pain is interfering with this
fun activity that she and her husband have enjoyed
together for years. In recent months her husband
has been walking without her, while she stays at
home watching television or reading. Because of this
decrease in physical activity, Marion has gained 10
pounds and is feeling her energy levels lessen and
her self-confidence diminish.
Marion has five grandchildren who come to visit
every couple of weeks and who love to play in her
large backyard. She has always relished playing with
the grandkids, but in the last year or so her back
has gotten so bad that she can no longer join in the
fun and games. More recently, she has had to sit in
a patio chair and just watch the kids. Not being able
to participate in these physical activities with her
grandchildren is quite depressing for Marion.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

In addition to her back pain issues, Marion also
experiences right-side shoulder pain and a little
right knee pain after playing a lot of golf. She has
noticed that if she plays golf on two consecutive
days, her right shoulder is very uncomfortable for
many days after. Consequently, Marion cannot play
golf on both Saturday and Sunday when she has the
most time to enjoy her favorite sport.

CLIENT GOALS
Marion identified five goals that she hopes participation in a corrective exercise program will help her
achieve:
1. Get through her workday (and associated obligations) without back pain.
2. Return to walking with her husband.
3. Play golf without pain and discomfort in her
lower back and shoulder.
4. Actively play with her grandchildren when they
come to visit.
5. Feel better when she gets out of bed in the
morning so that she doesn’t feel so “old.”
Marion indicated in her initial consultation that
she can commit to 25 to 35 minutes a day for her
corrective exercise homework.

STRUCTURAL
ASSESSMENT RESULTS
The completed Client Assessment Diagram (figure
25.1) contains additional information about Marion’s
musculoskeletal condition that was gathered during
her initial consultation and assessment.

EXERCISE PROGRAMMING
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This section contains an overview of the first five
sessions of the corrective exercise program that
was designed to help Marion successfully alleviate
her chronic back pain. The details of each session
and the rationale for choosing each exercise are
provided. This will help you to better understand
the strategic nature of The BioMechanics Method
approach to corrective exercise program design,
and it will help you to apply your skills when working with real clients. All of the exercises included
in Marion’s program are contained in chapters 19,
20, and 21.

SESSION 1
Duration: 1 hour

EXERCISE SELECTION
INFORMATION
The exercises that were chosen for Marion’s first
session and subsequent homework were designed to
address her underlying musculoskeletal issues, but
they were also intended to help reduce her symptoms
as quickly as possible. This would show her the value
of the program and would motivate her to complete
her homework while preparing for her next session.

Daily Homework Exercises
and Instructions
The following exercises were chosen for
Marion’s first session based on her assessment
results and stated goals. The wording of
all instructions in this and later sessions
were created together by Marion and her
corrective exercise specialist (certified in
The BioMechanics Method) at the conclusion
of each session in an effort to increase her
adherence and motivation. A photograph of
Marion performing each exercise was also
taken to accompany the written homework
instructions, and these were added to her
client program workbook.
1. Foam Roller Gluteal Complex: Place
ankle on opposite knee. Lean on elbow
or balance on hand while you pull knee
toward chest. Roll all sore spots on butt
for 1 to 2 minutes on each side.
2. Foam Roller IT Band: Roll all sore spots
you find from side of hip down to knee.
Pause on the worst areas for 10 to 20
seconds to help them release. Roll both
sides for 1 to 2 minutes on each leg.
3. Two Tennis Balls on Upper Back: Begin
with balls on middle of upper back at
about bra height. “Scoot” body down
to move balls up. Tilt pelvis to increase
pressure. Use pillow to keep line of sight
perpendicular to floor. To decrease
pressure, increase pillow height. Spend 2
to 3 minutes finding all sore spots.
4. Calf Massage (with baseball): Massage
calf muscles with baseball placed on
hard-covered book. Find as many sore
spots as possible, and spend 1 to 2
minutes on each calf.


Sample Sessions and Program

5. Calf Stretch: Keep back foot straight and
raise arch. Stretch both sides for 20 to 30
seconds.
6. Glute Stretch: Pull knee to chest as you
drop hip down and away from knee to
keep butt bone on floor. Rotate torso
gently to increase stretch if needed. Do
both sides for 20 to 30 seconds.
After Marion was asked at the beginning of
her session if she was prepared to purchase
a foam roller for use at home, it was agreed
that her program (and homework) would
commence with these initial exercises.

RATIONALE FOR EXERCISE
SELECTION
The reasoning behind each exercise choice for Marion’s first corrective exercise session and homework
assignments follows.

Session 1: Exercise 1
Name of Exercise: Foam Roller Gluteal Complex
Selection Rationale: This exercise was chosen
first for several reasons. Marion’s structural
assessment results revealed that she has an
anterior pelvic tilt and excessive lumbar lordosis. As a result, the muscles that originate
on the back and sides of the pelvis, sacrum,
and fascia of the lower back are restricted and
tight. This exercise would help release some of
the tension in this area of her body to reduce
her lower back pain.
This exercise was also chosen to rejuvenate the muscles and tissues of this area in
preparation for stretching and strengthening
exercises that will be introduced later. These
progressions will be designed to help improve
function when Marion is walking and playing
golf.
Finally, this exercise was selected as the
opening exercise for the program because it is
fairly easy to do, and there is direct kinesthetic
feedback when a person is doing it correctly—
she can feel when she is on the right spot.
The use of this simple, yet effective, exercise
enables Marion to feel confident that she can
replicate the exercise at home.

Session 1: Exercise 2
Name of Exercise: Foam Roller IT Band

Selection Rationale: This exercise was selected
for a similar reason to the Foam Roller Gluteal
Complex. The IT band is the connective tissue
that helps continue the attachment of the gluteus maximus muscle to just below the knee.
Therefore, the IT band has a direct impact on
the function of both the lower back and the
knee. During the assessment, Marion stated
that she sometimes also experiences knee
pain, so rolling the IT band will help this issue
as well as her lower back.

Session 1: Exercise 3
Name of Exercise: Two Tennis Balls on Upper
Back
Selection Rationale: This exercise was chosen
next because Marion’s structural assessment
indicated that she has excessive thoracic
kyphosis and spends much of her day in a
rounded shoulder position hunched over a
desk. This exercise will rejuvenate and regenerate the muscles of this area in preparation
for strengthening exercises that will be added
later in the program to help pull her thoracic
spine back into extension (i.e., more upright).
Training the thoracic extensors to work correctly will also help reduce stress on the lower
back since it will not have to arch so much
to help keep the spine upright. Lastly, this
exercise is included in her program early on
because it will target the underlying cause of
Marion’s lower back pain (excessive thoracic
kyphosis as identified in her CAD).

Session 1: Exercise 4
Name of Exercise: Calf Massage (with baseball)
Selection Rationale: This exercise was chosen
partly because of Marion’s typical choice of
footwear: high-heeled shoes. Marion’s assessment results indicate that she overpronates,
and this imbalance (and her choice of footwear)
has caused her calf muscles to become tight
and restricted. Consequently, these muscles
are always irritated and prevent her from being
able to dorsiflex at the ankle correctly. This
lack of dorsiflexion prevents her from being
able to move her pelvis and lower back into a
more neutral position when standing or walking. The baseball on a book variation of the calf
massage was chosen so that Marion would not
have to round her shoulders forward to reach
down to massage her calves. Instead, she can
release her calf muscles while sitting upright.

Sample Sessions and Program

Session 1: Exercise 5
Name of Exercise: Calf Stretch
Selection Rationale: This exercise was selected
next because it is a natural progression from
the Calf Massage (with baseball). Increasing
the flexibility of Marion’s calf muscles will help
her to reduce her anterior pelvic tilt and the
associated lower back pain.

Session 1: Exercise 6
Name of Exercise: Glute Stretch
Selection Rationale: The Foam Roller Gluteal
Complex exercise performed earlier in the
session was in preparation for this stretching
exercise. It was selected at this point because
it follows the recommended order of progression from self-myofascial release exercise to
stretching. This exercise also helps release
tension from her lower back and sets her up for
a further progression to glute strengthening
exercises later in the program.
In addition, Marion’s overpronation causes
her knee to move toward the midline and her
leg to internally rotate. The gluteus maximus
muscle, which originates on the lower back and
the back of the pelvis and attaches to the lower
leg, is negatively affected by this movement
dysfunction. Every time Marion overpronates,
the insertion of the gluteus maximus is pulled
away from its origin on her lower back. If she
can gain some flexibility in her gluteus maximus by performing this stretch, her overpronation issues will not affect the position of her
lower back (and her pain) to the same degree.

SESSION 2
Duration: 1 hour

EXERCISE SELECTION
INFORMATION
At the start of Marion’s second session, the exercises she had been performing for homework were
reviewed. It was determined that she had been doing
her exercises regularly and correctly. Therefore,
some of the exercises were ready to be progressed
(the Foam Roller Gluteal Complex) and some new
exercises were added (the Foam Roller Hip Flexors
and Hip Flexor Stretch [Sagittal]). Some of the original exercises remained the same because they were
still providing a benefit for Marion.
Only those exercises that were progressed,
regressed, or newly added to the program required

new written instructions and photographs. Clients
who need to refer back to instructions or pictures
for previous exercises will have easy access to this
information in their client program workbooks.

Daily Homework Exercises
and Instructions
The following exercises were chosen for
Marion’s second session based on her
homework review, progress, and stated goals.
1. Baseball on Gluteal Complex*: Place
baseball on 3 to 4 sore spots across top
of buttocks and hold for 20 to 30 seconds
on each spot. Place ankle on knee of
opposite leg. Do both sides.
2. Foam Roller IT Band
3. Two Tennis Balls on Upper Back
4. Calf Massage
5. Foam Roller Hip Flexors*: Place roller
perpendicular to leg and roll or hold on
sore spots at top of leg, just below hip
bone. Roll for about 1 minute each side.
6. Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal)*: Tuck hip
under on side that is kneeling. Contract
butt to help push hip forward. Raise arm
slowly, ensuring that butt muscle does not
let go. Hold for about 15 seconds on each
side and repeat.
7. Glute Stretch
8. Calf Stretch
Note: * indicates progression or regression from previous session or
newly added exercise.

RATIONALE FOR EXERCISE
SELECTION AND PROGRAM
CHANGES
The reasoning behind each new exercise choice for
Marion’s second corrective exercise session and new
homework assignments follow.

Session 2: Exercise 1
Name of Exercise: Baseball on Gluteal Complex
Selection Rationale: While reviewing the Foam
Roller Gluteal Complex exercise, Marion indicated that there were still several sore spots on
her buttocks. She also said she felt like releasing the tension in her glutes was really helping
her lower back feel better. However, she also
noted that if she did the Foam Roller Gluteal
Complex exercise for too long on her right side,

371


372

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

then her right shoulder would start to hurt
from balancing herself on the roller. As a result
of this feedback, the decision was made to
continue with self-massaging her glutes, but to
use a baseball instead of the roller. The smaller
surface area of the baseball would target the
muscle specifically to continue releasing tension; however, using a baseball instead of the
roller would allow her to lie down while releasing her glutes so her shoulder would not hurt
while performing this exercise.

Session 2: Exercise 5
Name of Exercise: Foam Roller Hip Flexors
Selection Rationale: This exercise was included
in Marion’s program to address one of the major
environmental causes of her musculoskeletal
issues and back pain: namely, the fact that
she sits for many hours a day in hip flexion.
Marion’s hip flexors have become chronically
shortened as a result of her desk job. This
is problematic because the major hip flexor
muscle, the psoas major, originates from the
lumbar spine and inserts at the top of the
femur. Hence, chronically shortened hip flexor
muscles pull the lumbar spine forward toward
the legs. This pulling motion increases Marion’s
lumbar lordosis and resultant back pain. The
Foam Roller Hip Flexors exercise will release
tension and help restore flexibility to this
muscle group, thereby reducing unnecessary
stress to her lumbar spine.

Session 2: Exercise 6
Name of Exercise: Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal)
Selection Rationale: This exercise was chosen
as a progression from the Foam Roller Hip
Flexors exercise. It is important to work on
the mobility of Marion’s hip flexors because
in her next session, the plan is to integrate an
exercise to strengthen her glutes. The hip flexors are the antagonist muscles of the gluteus
maximus. If they are tight, they will restrict
hip extension and the ability of the glutes
to contract concentrically to push the hips
forward. Therefore, both the self-myofascial
release and stretching exercises for Marion’s
hip flexors were taught during this session so
she can perform them as additional homework
exercises in preparation for the next session. If
Marion performs these exercises regularly and
correctly, her hip flexors will release, allowing her program to progress effectively with
the introduction of the glute strengthening
exercise earmarked for Session 3.

SESSION 3
Duration: 1 hour

EXERCISE SELECTION
INFORMATION
Marion has shown real dedication to performing her
homework exercises and has completed them every
day. She reports that her lower back pain symptoms
are decreasing and that she is finding it easier to
both sit and stand for longer periods of time without
pain. As with previous sessions, Marion’s homework
exercises were reviewed, and she feels confident that
she can perform all of her exercises correctly. Based
on her feedback and commitment, adjustments were
made to her program, including the addition of some
new stretches and a strengthening exercise.
Since Marion’s muscles and soft tissue structures
are becoming looser and more flexible due to her
continued performance of her self-myofascial release
exercises, she can spend less time on those exercises
and still receive the same benefits. This gives her
more time to add new exercises to her program
without going over the 25- to 35-minute time frame
she has committed for her homework.

Daily Homework Exercises
and Instructions
The following exercises were chosen for
Marion’s third session based on her homework
review, feedback, and progress.
1. All roller and ball exercises: as shown
previously
2. Foam Roller Quadriceps*: Roll on the front
of thighs from the hip down to the knee,
pausing on all sore spots. Pay special
attention to the area on the side/front of
the thigh near the top. Roll each side for 1
to 2 minutes.
3. Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal)
4. Glute Stretch
5. Calf Stretch
6. Quadriceps Stretch (standing)*: Place foot
on armrest of couch. Keep hips aligned
left to right as you tuck pelvis under. Keep
torso erect without arching lower back.
Use balance aid like back of a chair if
needed. Hold stretch on both sides for 20
to 30 seconds.
7. Door Frame Stretch*: Stand between
door frame and reach outside arm up and
over head to grab one side of door frame.


Sample Sessions and Program

Place other hand on door frame at hip
level. Place foot that is farthest away from
your hands behind other foot. Keep both
feet planted on floor as you push outside
hip away from door frame. Stretch both
sides for about 15 seconds and repeat.
8. Butt Lift (on ball)*: Balance mid- to
upper back on ball with feet on floor.
Keep the hips tucked under as you lift
and lower the hips. Lift only as far as you
can without letting go of a neutral pelvic
position. Touch your hands to the ground
if you need help balancing. Do 6 to 10
repetitions or less if your technique falters.
Note: * indicates progression or regression from previous session or
newly added exercise.

RATIONALE FOR EXERCISE
SELECTION AND PROGRAM
CHANGES
The reasoning behind each new exercise choice for
Marion’s third corrective exercise session and new
homework assignments follow.

Session 3: Exercise 2
Name of Exercise: Foam Roller Quadriceps
Selection Rationale: Marion’s center of gravity is positioned slightly forward (due to her
excessive thoracic kyphosis and anterior pelvic
tilt), so her quadriceps muscles are tight and
overworked from trying to stop her body from
falling forward. The rectus femoris muscle (one
of the quadriceps) originates from the front of
the pelvis and attaches to the kneecap. When
this quadriceps muscle is restricted and irritated, it can pull the front of the pelvis down
toward the kneecap, making her anterior pelvic
tilt and resultant back pain worse. This foam
roller exercise will rejuvenate and regenerate
Marion’s quadriceps and prepare them for the
exercise that follows.

Session 3: Exercise 6
Name of Exercise: Quadriceps Stretch (standing)
Selection Rationale: This exercise is a natural
progression from the Foam Roller Quadriceps
exercise. As mentioned previously, releasing
tension in the quadriceps will help lessen
Marion’s anterior pelvic tilt (and accompanying

excessive lumbar lordosis), thereby alleviating her back pain. Stretching the quadriceps
(especially the rectus femoris) will also enable
Marion’s hips to extend more easily, which will
enable her to shift her center of gravity over her
pelvis, her base of support. This combination
of factors means that Marion will experience
much less stress in her feet, knees, lower back,
and neck when she is standing and walking.

Session 3: Exercise 7
Name of Exercise: Door Frame Stretch
Selection Rationale: Marion has been doing the
Two Tennis Balls on Upper Back exercise consistently since the beginning of her program.
Her thoracic extensors are now suppler, and
the structures of her thoracic spine and rib
cage should be ready for the introduction of
some integrated movement. The Door Frame
Stretch was added to Marion’s program for
the purpose of moving and loosening up her
thoracic spine in the frontal plane (i.e., bending
from side to side).
The overall goal of her program will be to
increase the range of motion in Marion’s thoracic spine in all three planes of movement so
the lower back will not have to work overtime
to generate most of her torso motions. This
stretch was added to promote side-to-side
motion in her thoracic spine. Subsequent
exercises will be added later in the program
to increase mobility in the transverse and
sagittal planes, that is, in rotation and forward
and backward.

Session 3: Exercise 8
Name of Exercise: Butt Lift (on ball)
Selection Rationale: Throughout her program,
Marion has progressed through the appropriate self-myofascial and stretching progressions for her glutes. She is now ready to begin
strengthening the gluteus maximus muscle
concentrically to enable her hips to extend
fully, thereby taking stress off the structures
of her lumbar spine and knees. Since Marion
sometimes has pain in her right shoulder, this
exercise was adapted with Marion supporting
her torso on a stability ball to avoid placing
undue stress on her shoulder. Marion already
had a stability ball at home, so this alternative
version of the Butt Lift exercise was an easy
solution.

SESSION 4
Duration: 1 hour

EXERCISE SELECTION
INFORMATION
Marion has continued to perform all of her homework exercises regularly and correctly. She was
happy to report at the beginning of this session that
she attended a work function several days ago and
was able to stand for three hours without pain. She
had also gone for a walk with her husband on the
weekend and said it was the longest walk they had
enjoyed together for years. She still finds that her
back is quite sore after golf, but she is pleased with
her other improvements. Based on her feedback,
adjustments were made to her program, including
exercises designed to target Marion’s torso and
upper back.

Daily Homework Exercises
and Instructions
The following exercises were chosen for
Marion’s fourth session based on her
homework review, feedback, and continued
progress.
1. All rollers and balls: as previously shown
2. Foam Roller Quadratus Lumborum*: Roll
between top of pelvis and bottom of
ribs. Do not place direct pressure on ribs.
Keep knees bent, and roll each side for 30
seconds to 1 minute.
3. Tennis Ball Around Shoulder Blade*: Place
ball on all sore spots between shoulder
blade and spine. Hug opposite shoulder
to move shoulder blade away from spine.
Bend knees and use pillow to support
head if needed. Spend 2 to 3 minutes on
each side.
4. Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal)
5. Glute Stretch
6. Calf Stretch
7. Quadriceps Stretch (standing)
8. Door Frame Stretch
9. Butt Lift (on ball)
10. Wave Goodbye (Lying)*: Support both
elbows and head with small pillow or

rolled-up towel. Rotate backs of hands
onto larger pillows placed to side of
head. Keep shoulders back and down
and pelvis tucked under to make sure you
don’t cheat with lower back. Hold each
contraction for about 20 seconds and do
2 to 3 repetitions.
Note: * indicates progression or regression from previous session or
newly added exercise.

RATIONALE FOR EXERCISE
SELECTION AND PROGRAM
CHANGES
The reasoning behind each new exercise choice for
Marion’s fourth corrective exercise session and new
homework assignments follow.

Session 4: Exercise 2
Name of Exercise: Foam Roller Quadratus
Lumborum
Selection Rationale: During the review of
Marion’s homework from the previous session,
she indicated that she felt a large degree of
stretch on the sides of her lower back when she
performed the Door Frame Stretch. The Foam
Roller Quadratus Lumborum self-myofascial
release exercise was added to her program to
help loosen up the sides of her lower back and
torso to gain more benefit from the Door Frame
Stretch. Loosening her quadratus lumborum
will also help improve the flexibility of the soft
tissues that lie between the back of her pelvis,
the lumbar spine, and the bottom of her rib
cage. This will enable her entire spine, pelvis,
and rib cage to move more freely and will
increase Marion’s torso mobility. This will be
especially helpful both for improving her golf
swing and for reducing her pain after walking
and playing golf.

Session 4: Exercise 3
Name of Exercise: Tennis Ball Around Shoulder
Blade
Selection Rationale: Marion now has a number
of exercises to reduce her back pain and
strengthen the muscles of her lumbo-pelvic hip
region while also mobilizing her thoracic spine.
Therefore, attention can now turn to addressing the imbalances around her shoulder girdle


Sample Sessions and Program

to help alleviate her shoulder pain. The Tennis
Ball Around Shoulder Blade exercise will
loosen up her rhomboids and trapezius muscles
in preparation for later strengthening exercises to move her scapula, thoracic spine, and
shoulder into better alignment. This exercise
was chosen because it is one that Marion can
easily add to her program while performing
her other floor-based exercises.

Session 4: Exercise 10
Name of Exercise: Wave Goodbye (Lying)
Selection Rationale: The Wave Goodbye
(Lying) is a progression from the Tennis Ball
Around Shoulder Blade exercise. The Wave
Goodbye (Lying) exercise will strengthen
Marion’s scapula depressors, retractors, and
the muscles that externally rotate her arms.
Strengthening these muscles will help correct the imbalances in her thoracic spine and
shoulder girdle. Correcting these imbalances
will alleviate her shoulder pain and will enable
her to extend her upper back, thereby reducing
her lower back pain as well.

SESSION 5
Duration: 1 hour

EXERCISE SELECTION
INFORMATION
Marion has been diligent with her corrective exercise program, and she is seeing much improvement
in the reduction of her painful symptoms. She
continues to be virtually pain-free when standing,
and she has been able to take increasingly longer
walks with her husband. She rarely experiences
tightness in her lower back when she wakes up,
and this has made a noticeable difference in her
disposition. She is looking forward to an upcoming
visit from the grandkids, and she thinks she will be
able to participate in many of the activities they have
planned. Although her thoracic spine mobility has
improved, her excessive thoracic kyphosis remains
the biggest obstacle to the complete eradication of
her symptoms. Based on her feedback, adjustments
were made to Marion’s program to continue focusing on the torso and upper back, and an integrated
eccentric strengthening exercise (Lunge With Knee
Pull) was added.

Daily Homework Exercises
and Instructions
The following exercises were chosen for
Marion’s fifth session based on her homework
review, feedback, and the need to progress
her program to more directly address her
excessive thoracic kyphosis.
1. All rollers and balls: as previously shown
2. Tennis Ball Around Shoulder Blade
3. Hip Flexor Stretch (Sagittal)
4. Glute Stretch
5. Calf Stretch
6. Quadriceps Stretch (standing)
7. Door Frame Stretch
8. Wall Rotation Stretch*: Keep feet straight
and hips level. Rotate sternum toward wall
without rotating hips. Keep head looking
forward and spine erect. Do not let hips
shift left or right or spine bend to the side.
Hold stretch for about 20 seconds on
both sides.
9. Straight Arm Raise (Lying)*: Bend knees,
and keep pelvis tilted. Pull shoulders
back and down as you try to pull straight
arms down toward a large pillow or a
foam roller placed above your head. Use
additional smaller pillow to support head
if needed. Hold each contraction for about
20 seconds and do 2 to 3 repetitions.
10. Wave Goodbye (Standing)*: Lean back
against the wall with your knees slightly
bent and pelvis tucked under to flatten
your lower back to the wall. Keep elbows
forward and shoulders back and down as
you rotate backs of hands to wall. Hold
contraction for about 20 seconds. Do 2 to
3 repetitions.
11. Lunge With Knee Pull (with rotation)*: In
lunge position, pull knee toward midline
as you rotate hip back and away from
knee toward back foot. Don’t round
shoulders; keep head looking down and
forward. Use opposite arm to help rotate
torso back. Hold each repetition for a few
seconds. Try 3 to 4 repetitions total or less
if technique falters.
Note: * indicates progression or regression from previous session or
newly added exercise.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

RATIONALE FOR EXERCISE
SELECTION AND PROGRAM
CHANGES
The reasoning behind each new exercise choice for
Marion’s fifth corrective exercise session and new
homework assignments follow.

Session 5: Exercise 8
Name of Exercise: Wall Rotation Stretch
Selection Rationale: Marion’s thoracic spine
has started to gain mobility in the frontal plane
(that is, from side to side) from performing the
Door Frame Stretch. The Wall Rotation Stretch
was added to help increase her mobility in
this area in the transverse plane. Increasing
her ability to rotate her thoracic spine will
help decrease stress on her lower back when
she is walking and playing golf. Both of these
activities require the torso to rotate to swing
the arms. If the torso cannot rotate, then the
lumbar spine and hips typically compensate
by overrotating.

Session 5: Exercise 9
Name of Exercise: Straight Arm Raise (Lying)
Selection Rationale: Several exercises have
already been incorporated into Marion’s program to improve the mobility of her thoracic
spine. The Two Tennis Balls on Upper Back
exercise has helped her gain more thoracic
extension, the Door Frame Stretch has
helped her improve lateral movement, and
the Wall Rotation Stretch will help increase
her ability to rotate this area. The addition
of the Straight Arm Raise (Lying) exercise
will strengthen her thoracic extensors with
the goal of retraining this area so that she
can maintain a better posture during the day
when seated at work.
This variation of the exercise was chosen
because Marion can perform this exercise on
the floor. She can control her lower back by
tilting her pelvis instead of arching her lower
back, and she can keep her shoulders from
shrugging. Control over these movements will
ensure that she strengthens the right muscles
without further stressing those areas that are
already irritated or overworked.

Session 5: Exercise 10
Name of Exercise: Wave Goodbye (Standing)
Selection Rationale: Marion was previously
given the Wave Goodbye (Lying) exercise for
homework, and she was able to do it proficiently.
Marion appeared ready to progress to the
standing version of this exercise to increase its
benefit. Progressing to the standing version will
result in the continued strengthening of her
thoracic extensors, scapula depressors, retractors, and external rotators of the arm. It will
also ensure that Marion continues to improve
the position (and condition) of her torso. This
will relieve stress on her knees, lower back, and
shoulders. Marion will perform this exercise
with her feet slightly away from the wall so
she can tilt her pelvis more easily and avoid
any tendency to cheat by using her lower back.

Session 5: Exercise 11
Name of Exercise: Lunge With Knee Pull (with
rotation)
Selection Rationale: This exercise replaces the
Butt Lift, and is the first in Marion’s program
where she will be trying to coordinate a fairly
complex movement against the force of gravity. After careful consideration, the decision to
add the Lunge With Knee Pull (with rotation)
exercise was made based on her significant
reduction in symptoms, her dedication to accurate technique, and her regular performance
of her homework exercises.
The fact that Marion is ready for this complex exercise is very exciting from a program
design standpoint. She will now be learning to
control her lower and upper body simultaneously to coordinate movements that resemble
many of the activities she enjoys. The Lunge
With Knee Pull (with rotation) exercise is
designed to strengthen the gluteal muscles
eccentrically as they slow down hip flexion and
internal rotation of the leg. To achieve this, the
torso must rotate correctly away from the front
leg to pull the origin of the gluteus maximus
away from its insertion just below the knee.
This replicates the movements Marion makes
when she walks and plays golf, and it will bring
her closer to her goal of participating in those
activities without pain.


Sample Sessions and Program

CASE STUDY CONCLUSION
The session just described marked the completion
of Marion’s fifth corrective exercise session and
homework, but not the end of her corrective exercise
program. Marion continued to participate fully in
the program and was dedicated to completing her
homework exercises. After 10 sessions, Marion was
pain free during daily activities and was able to golf,
walk, and play with her grandkids regularly without
pain. Based on her progress, Marion was also able to
return to a program of regular exercise. She continued to integrate corrective exercise techniques into
her workouts to maintain and to keep improving her
musculoskeletal health.
Revisit this case study regularly as you continue
to practice, refine, and apply your consultation skills,
your assessment skills, your anatomy knowledge, and
your corrective exercise program design abilities.

DOCUMENTING
YOUR OWN CLIENTS’
HOMEWORK
In addition to Marion’s hard work and dedication,
an important part of her success was organizing
and tracking her homework exercises in her client
program workbook. Documenting your client’s homework is imperative to keeping programs on track
and ensuring progression. While client program
workbooks are ideal for helping clients to maintain, organize, and easily refer to their homework
exercises, emailing homework instructions (and
pictures or video), or copying the files to a flash
drive or to accessible online storage, can also be
used effectively to manage your client’s homework
assignments.
Following are some guidelines for creating a client’s homework instructions and visual aids.

■■When recording assessment information and

homework exercise information, write legibly
(or print in large, clear type) so the client can
easily read what you have written.
■■If clients prefer, you can allow them to write out
their own instructions. Some clients may need
more written instructions and key points than
others, so provide as many pages as they need.
■■When taking still pictures or video of clients,
pay attention to what they are wearing because
the color of their clothing may affect the quality
of the images. Clothing that blends in with the
background may produce unclear images. Find
a way to contrast the client with the background
before taking pictures.
■■Some clients may need their pictures printed in
a larger size so they can see what they are doing
in each exercise. Sending pictures via email, or
saving them onto a portable storage device, will
enable them to make their pictures as large as
they need.
■■Exercises that are more complex or require

many coordinated movements may require
more than one picture. Take several pictures of
the exercise from different angles, or use video.
■■For ease of reference, number or name each picture or video so it corresponds to the number or
name of each written instruction for an exercise.
■■Include the date on each set of homework
instructions. This is for ease of reference, and
it helps you review information from previous
sessions.
■■Include the date and time of your next appointment as part of the homework instructions.
Including this information acts as a tangible
reminder for the client and can prevent aggravation and possible arguments if a client misses
a scheduled appointment time.

Self-Check
As you know, Marion needed additional sessions to ensure that all her needs and program
goals were met. Based on this case study about her program aims and current progress,
consider what exercises might be of benefit to Marion for her next two sessions. Write your
exercise selection choices and rationales in the tables that follow.
Note: While the tables include all three types of exercise modalities (self-myofascial release,
stretching, and strengthening) and up to three exercises for each, it is not necessary to fill
every cell in each table because this would be too many exercises to add to Marion’s program.
Choose only exercises that you think are appropriate for Marion’s next two sessions.
