# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 15: Self-Myofascial Release

CHAPTER 15
Self-Myofascial Release
In this chapter, you will learn about various selfmyofascial release techniques and why they should
be used at the outset of a client’s program before
stretching and strengthening exercises are introduced. (The terms self-myofascial release and selfmassage are interchangeable. Many clients prefer
the term self-massage because they are familiar
with massage and are more enthusiastic about
learning the techniques.) You will learn how these
techniques rejuvenate and rehabilitate soft tissue
structures, address musculoskeletal imbalances, and
alleviate musculoskeletal dysfunctions and pain. You
will also learn tips for teaching and cueing clients on
these techniques and ways to progress and regress
these techniques.

WHAT IS SELFMYOFASCIAL RELEASE?
Self-myofascial release may sound complex and
technical, but it is really a very simple concept. The
term myofascial refers to muscles and the fascia
that surrounds them; the prefix myo- simply means
“muscle.” Therefore, self-myofascial release is a massage technique of applying sustained pressure to an
area of myofascial tissue that contains restrictions,
tightness, inflexibility, adhesions, knots, or scar
tissue, or lacks proper movement. The sustained
pressure stimulates circulation to the area, reduces
pressure buildup from sluggish blood flow and
toxins, and improves tissue elasticity and suppleness (Travell and Simons 1992; Simons, Travell,
and Simons 1998). It is important to understand the
properties of muscles and fascia before using self-

myofascial release. This will enable you to appreciate
how they can be helped by the appropriate application of these techniques.

MUSCLES
Skeletal muscle is the most common form of muscle
tissue in the body. Apart from the tongue, all skeletal muscles are connected at both ends to bones by
tendons. The origin point of a muscle is the end that
is attached to a bone that is either fixed in position
or has less movement capability (usually nearer the
body’s center of mass). The insertion point is the end
that is attached to a bone with greater movement
capability (Hyde 2002). Muscles are comprised of
bands of tissue that typically run in the same direction as the force they apply to the bones and joints.
For example, the tissues of the biceps brachii muscle
originate from portions of the scapula and insert on
the end of the radius and the fascia in the lower arm
near the elbow (Scheumann 2007). The bands of
fibers in this muscle run lengthwise down the upper
arm because their function is to help pull the lower
arm toward the shoulder when contracted. There
are also muscles, such as the gluteus maximus, that
have multiple functions and contain fibers that run in
multiple directions. The origin and insertion points
of muscles, and the direction the muscle fibers run,
determine the actions of each muscle or muscle group
(Hyde 2002). Adhesions, nodules, knots, scar tissue,
and inflexibility in muscles can affect the muscle’s
ability to perform these actions correctly. The regular
application of self-myofascial release techniques can
help realign these muscle fibers so that the muscle
can function effectively (Clark and Lucett 2011).

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Skeletal muscle can lengthen and stretch, shorten
and contract, and return to its normal shape. These
properties are called elasticity, contractility, and
extensibility, respectively (Hyde 2002). From a corrective exercise standpoint, all three are extremely
important. The contraction function of muscles
enables the skeleton to move. The ability of muscles
to lengthen and stretch appropriately facilitates the
“bungee cord action” that decelerates movement
and reduces stress on joints. The ability of muscles
to return to their usual shape enables all the parts
of the body to return to normal, allowing rest and
preventing the onset of negative musculoskeletal
changes. The regular application of self-myofascial
release techniques has been shown to help improve
all three of these muscle functions by improving the
sensitivity, repair and recovery, growth, and performance of muscle tissue (Beck 2010).

FASCIA
Fascia is connective tissue that wraps around and
separates bundles of muscle fibers, entire muscles,
and every other layer of tissue in the body. It runs
throughout the body, connecting all the structures
into one inseparable kinetic chain (see figure 13.3)
(Myers 2008; Scheumann 2007).
The overall condition and health of the fascia
should be addressed from the outset of any corrective exercise program. This is because restrictions
or tightness in the fascia is generally manifested
as musculoskeletal compensation patterns and
imbalances, which often present as muscle tension
and pain. The regular application of self-myofascial
release helps to regulate myofascial tension throughout the body to decrease movement stress, improve
blood flow, and increase range of motion (Rolf 1989).
Unhealthy fascia and muscle fibers are prone to
develop very dysfunctional (and sometimes painful)
characteristics such as excessive tightness, nodules,
adhesions, and inflexibility (Scheumann 2007).
Such symptoms can indicate where self-myofascial
release might be applied to restore health and vitality to those tissues that need it most. Clients will
appreciate the reduction and elimination of painful
symptoms that self-myofascial release techniques
can provide.

ORIGINS OF SELFMYOFASCIAL RELEASE
The use of myofascial release techniques is not a
new idea. Self-massage has been used in one form
or another to promote health, relieve stress, and
reduce pain for approximately 5,000 years. It is

thought to have originated around 2500 to 3000
BC, and its use as a health tool was documented
in early Chinese medical texts and depicted in
ancient Egyptian tomb paintings (Calvert 2002).
Massage also has documented roots in traditional
Indian medicine dating as far back as 1500 BC. The
ancient Greeks and Romans were among those who
recognized the therapeutic qualities of massage, and
they incorporated it into their daily health regimens.
Even Julius Caesar (100 to 44 BC) used massage to
help relieve pain (Sinha 2001). Practitioners in the
Persian empire also believed in the benefits of exercise and massage, and they went about diagnosing
and assessing conditions and prescribing massage
techniques to help relieve pain. In the mid-1800s,
the word massage was formally introduced in the
Western medical community. Swedish massage
became very popular, and many of the techniques
developed during that time are still used today (Calvert 2002). Finnish and Russian influences further
expanded the use of massage into sport massage
and neuromuscular therapy.
Massage and myofascial release are now used
in many settings around the world, from spas to
hospitals, as a therapeutic and restorative strategy.
Currently, the most popular forms of massage used
for corrective purposes are applied to a general area
of the body using a large tool like a foam roller or
pinpointing a specific area of muscle or fascia using
a small massage device like a tennis ball or Theracane (Price 2013; Price and Bratcher 2010; Simons,
Travell, and Simons 1998; Travell and Simons 1992).

BENEFITS OF SELFMYOFASCIAL RELEASE
There are many documented reasons why corrective exercise clients benefit from regularly
performing self-myofascial release. Massaging the
myofascial structures affected by the most common
musculoskeletal imbalances has been shown to do
the following (Abelson and Abelson 2003; Brummitt 2008; Calvert 2002; Inkster 2015; Price 2013;
Simons, Travell, and Simons 1998; Travell and
Simons 1992):
■■Increases circulation, enabling oxygen and

other nutrients to reach vital tissues, muscles,
and organs
■■Increases joint flexibility, preparing joints for
the increased range of movement and load that
accompanies stretching and strengthening
exercises
■■Reduces adhesions and scar tissue and improves
the elasticity of muscles and other soft tissues


Self-Myofascial Release

■■Aids in the reduction of delayed onset muscle

soreness (DOMS)
■■Eliminates stored tension in muscles
■■Releases endorphins to help reduce pain
■■Relieves mental stress

TYPES OF SELFMYOFASCIAL RELEASE
There are two kinds of self-myofascial release techniques: general and specific. Both are very effective
for rejuvenating and regenerating muscles affected
by musculoskeletal imbalances. They can be used
to rehabilitate and restore the health of soft tissue
structures, prepare them for movement at the
beginning of a corrective exercise session, and also
aid recovery after a bout of exercise or strenuous
activity.

GENERAL TECHNIQUES
General self-myofascial release techniques are those
that affect large areas of the body (Inkster 2015).
Devices with a large surface area, such as foam
rollers, are well suited for this type of massage (see
figure 15.1).
These general techniques are typically applied
at the beginning of a corrective exercise program
to address wide-ranging muscle and soft tissue
dysfunction (Myers 2008; Rolf 1989). For example,
if your assessment reveals that a client has a valgus
knee position, you know that his leg rotates in toward
the midline of his body. From your understanding
of muscles and movement, you also know that this
imbalance affects many of the muscle groups that
decelerate the inward rotation of the leg, such as
the hip rotators, gluteals, adductors, and hip flexors. Each of these muscle groups consists of several

Figure 15.1

technique: Foam roller on thoracic
spine.

individual muscles. Expecting your client to massage
each muscle in the group separately at the outset of
his program would be overwhelming and perhaps
unnecessary (the imbalance might affect some
muscles in the group more than others). Therefore,
general self-myofascial release techniques are very
good for the introductory stage of a program.
Since general self-myofascial techniques take
less time to affect a large area, they are also recommended if a client tells you that she lacks time to
perform her corrective exercise homework. General
techniques are also very useful for increasing blood
supply and flexibility before exercise as part of a
warm-up and for promoting rest and recovery as
part of a cool-down (Clark and Lucett 2011).

SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES
Specific self-myofascial release techniques target
individual muscles and precise “trigger” points in a
muscle or area of fascia. These more exacting forms
of self-massage usually require the use of sustained
pressure on a specific part of the body to help restore
movement and elasticity to individual muscles and
their associated fascia (Abelson and Abelson 2003;
Price 2013). Specific self-myofascial release techniques use massage tools with a smaller surface area
(e.g., tennis balls, golf balls, lacrosse balls, baseballs,
and trigger point therapy sticks such as Theracanes)
that can pinpoint a precise area of muscle or fascia
(see figure 15.2).

Figure 15.2 Specific self-myofascial release
technique: Theracane on back

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Specific self-myofascial release techniques
target smaller areas of the body like the foot or calf
muscles. They also enable you to focus on individual
muscles, or on a specific part of a muscle or fascia,
as a corrective exercise program progresses and
more precision is needed. For example, as you work
with a client with excessive thoracic kyphosis and
protracted shoulder blades, you might notice that his
right shoulder blade is more protracted than his left.
The use of a tennis ball on his right rhomboid (minor
and major) muscle would be a great technique to
address this specific imbalance.
Specific self-myofascial release techniques should
also be used when general self-myofascial release
techniques are not practical. This may include times
when a client is traveling and cannot take a foam
roller along, when buying a foam roller is impractical, or when a client cannot successfully perform
a foam roller exercise you recommend (Price and
Bratcher 2010).

TEACHING TIPS FOR SELFMYOFASCIAL RELEASE
TECHNIQUES
While self-myofascial release exercises are excellent for the outset of a corrective exercise program
from a physiological standpoint, they offer the added
benefit of enabling you to build a client’s confidence
by quickly alleviating symptoms of pain. Hence, it
is crucial to choose exercises that are appropriate
for a client’s condition, will promptly help to reduce
pain, and are presented in a way that will promote
long-term adherence and program success.
Here a re some su g gestion s for teach i n g
self-myofascial release techniques so that your clients will implement them successfully:
1. When you first introduce clients to a selfmyofascial release technique, they will often
ask about performance variables such as sets,
repetitions, duration, and frequency. It is important to remember that each client will have different needs, and the amount of time required
will vary from person to person. Part IV of
this text includes general guidelines for every
exercise in the exercise library, but you should
adjust the variables of any self-myofascial
release exercise to accommodate each client’s
needs and abilities.
2. Once you have identified an area of myofascial
restriction and chosen a self-myofascial release
exercise, give the client ample time to explore

the tight areas or sore spots for herself. A
client’s initial reaction to getting on a tennis
ball or foam roller will often be to tense up in
response to the discomfort or pressure she feels
from the restricted tissue. However, if given
time to adjust to these new sensations, she will
begin to relax, and hormones will be released
into her body to promote further relaxation.
Furthermore, allowing clients to explore areas
needing myofascial release allows them to find
sore spots on their own. This self-discovery
process will empower them to feel in control of
this new exercise and of the program in general,
increasing the likelihood that they will adhere
to their programs (Price 2016).
3. The self-myofascial release techniques you
suggest must be practical. Do not recommend
pieces of equipment that are hard to buy or
impractical to have on hand. For example, a fullsized foam roller is a very useful self-myofascial
release tool. However, it will not fit in a carryon-sized suitcase. If you have a client who flies
often and prefers not to check bags, then an
exercise requiring the use of a full-sized foam
roller would not be appropriate.
4. Always tell clients why they are performing a
particular self-myofascial release exercise and
how it relates to their condition. Understanding
the rationale behind your exercise recommendations gives them a good reason to perform
the exercises regularly (Whitworth et al. 2007).
5. As clients perform self-myofascial release
exercises, you will see their confidence level
rise as their myofascial tension subsides. This
growing confidence is usually accompanied
by thoughts of what might be coming next in
their corrective exercise program (Feltz 1992).
You can harness this growing confidence to
increase their adherence by explaining how the
exercise being performed relates to the next
stage of their program. This helps preserve
their enthusiasm and prepares them mentally
for what will be expected of them next (Pappaioannou and Hackfort 2014). For example,
as a client becomes more confident with a
particular exercise, prepare for the next one by
saying something like, “Once we’ve warmed up
your hips and lower back with the foam roller,
we can start to teach the individual muscles
around that area to move correctly by integrating some stretching exercises. This will help
you get back to all those activities you enjoy,
like hiking and gardening.”

WHEN TO REGRESS SELFMYOFASCIAL TECHNIQUES

3. If a client does not understand how to perform
a self-myofascial release technique you have
recommended, regress the technique. For
example, if a client continues to place her body
in the wrong position when performing a foam
roller exercise, you must find a more appropriate exercise that she can perform successfully
(such as a comparable tennis ball exercise).

Clients must always feel successful in performing the
self-myofascial release techniques you recommend,
both while under your supervision and when doing
them on their own. Therefore, you need to know
how and when to regress these exercises—that is,
make them easier—if your client feels apprehensive,
hesitant, or unable to perform the exercise correctly.
1. Self-myofascial techniques should be regressed
any time a client feels uncomfortable or nervous
in any way. For example, if a client performing a
foam roller exercise keeps falling off or appears
uneasy, regress him to a technique that he can
perform more easily (see figure 15.3). Regressions that allow clients to remain in control
of their bodies during an exercise are vital to
increasing client confidence. They also help
clients to enjoy the process and to ease into
each exercise, allowing the myofascial structures they are addressing to relax and release.
2. Regress a self-myofascial release exercise if a
client experiences any type of pain. Since selfmyofascial release techniques are intended to
rejuvenate unhealthy soft tissue structures,
it is natural for clients to experience a little
discomfort or soreness when first using a foam
roller, tennis ball, or Theracane. However, if the
sensation is intense or does not diminish once
the exercise is underway, then the exercise
should be stopped and regressed appropriately.
Communicating with clients about what they
feel while they perform the exercise, and watching their body language to monitor their level
of discomfort, can help you determine whether
a regression is needed.

4. Regress a self-myofascial technique if performing it causes pain or discomfort to another part
of the client’s body. For example, several foam
roller exercises require clients to balance on
one arm while rolling their legs or hips. Propping up their body weight with one arm may
place excessive stress on the shoulder or cause
pain. If this occurs, tell the client to stop performing the exercise and regress him to another
exercise that does not require him to support
himself on one arm.
5. If a client does not have a particular piece of
equipment (and is not willing to purchase one),
regress your self-myofascial exercise recommendation to a more accommodating option.
For example, if a client does not have a Theracane and does not want to buy one, you will
need to suggest an alternative exercise, such
as one that uses a tennis ball instead.

WAYS TO REGRESS SELFMYOFASCIAL TECHNIQUES
There are many ways to regress a self-myofascial
release exercise:
1. Allow the client to use a softer tool for applying
pressure, such as a less dense roller or a softer
ball for any of the exercises.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

2. Tell the client to perform an exercise while
seated or lying down. For example, the Golf
Ball Roll technique can be performed while
seated using a tennis ball (see figure 15.4),
thus reducing the amount of pressure on the
client’s foot.
3. Tell clients to use their fingers instead of a hard
self-myofascial release tool to massage tender
areas. You can further regress a self-myofascial
exercise by instructing a client to apply heat to
the affected area with a heating pad.
There are many different possibilities for regressing self-myofascial release exercises. A full library
of exercises and suggestions for regressions can
be found in chapter 19, Self-Myofascial Release
Exercises.

WHEN TO PROGRESS SELFMYOFASCIAL TECHNIQUES
Most clients would obviously like to improve their
musculoskeletal health as quickly as possible so they
can reduce their pain and improve their function.
Progressing their programs as soon as they become
proficient with an exercise is the most effective and
efficient way to do this.
1. Progress a self-myofascial technique if a client
no longer feels any tenderness when applying
pressure to the target area. For example, if a
client is rolling the quadriceps and no longer
feels pressure or sensitivity in that area, a suitable progression would be to use a harder roller
or to progress to an appropriate stretching
exercise for that body part (see figure 15.5).

Figure 15.4 The Golf Ball Roll can be regressed by having the client sit while performing the
exercise and using a tennis ball instead of a golf ball.

Figure 15.5 A quadriceps stretch is a progression from foam rolling this muscle group.


Self-Myofascial Release

2. Progress or find alternative self-myofascial
techniques if clients complain that their homework exercises take too long. For example, a
tennis ball has a small surface area and takes
considerable time to massage large areas of the
body. A foam roller, on the other hand, is a more
time-efficient tool due to its greater surface area.
3. Progress a self-myofascial release technique to
a stretching exercise if the target tissues have
released enough to perform the desired range
of motion or movement with correct technique.
For example, after a client has performed the
Golf Ball Roll to loosen up the tissues on the
underside of a foot, you can use a stretch (e.g.,
the Foot and Toe Stretch shown in chapter 20)
to evaluate the flexibility and movement of the
foot. If you find that the muscles are flexible
enough to perform the stretch correctly, then
progress and integrate it into the program.
However, if you progress to a stretch and find
that your client cannot perform the movement
correctly, you will need to go back and spend
more time releasing the area with the appropriate self-massage technique.

WAYS TO PROGRESS SELFMYOFASCIAL TECHNIQUES
There are many ways you can progress a selfmyofascial release exercise:
1. Direct a client to use a firmer roller or a harder
ball for applying pressure to those areas that
need releasing.
2. Integrate a stretch into the exercise. For
example, while a client is releasing his gluteal
muscles with the foam roller, you can coach

Figure 15.6 Integrated glute stretch.

him to pull his knee to his chest in order to
stretch the gluteal muscles at the same time
(see figure 15.6).
3. Coach the client to angle his body differently
to apply more pressure to the area being massaged. For example, if a client is using the foam
roller to massage his IT band, you can direct
him to place his other leg on top of the leg that
is in contact with the roller (see figure 15.7).
This added weight will increase the pressure
to the target area.
There are many different possibilities for progressing self-myofascial release exercises. A full library
of exercises and suggestions for progression can be
found in chapter 19, Self-Myofascial Release Exercises.

WHEN NOT TO USE SELFMYOFASCIAL RELEASE
TECHNIQUES
While SMR exercises are generally safe for most
clients to perform, observe the following contraindications in a corrective exercise setting (Clark and
Lucett 2011; Price and Bratcher 2010).
■■Do not use SMR on areas of the body that are

swollen or have edema (i.e., badly bruised or
acutely inflamed areas).
■■Do not use SMR on or near a blood clot.
■■Do not use SMR with clients who have acute
rheumatoid arthritis.
■■Do not perform SMR on or near open wounds.
■■Do not use SMR on clients who have had an
aneurysm.

■■Limit the use of SMR techniques with clients
who have very high blood pressure. If you are
ever in doubt about whether it is safe for clients
to perform SMR exercises, contact their physicians to obtain clearance.
■■Be conservative with the use of SMR on areas of
the body that are excessively tight or currently
in spasm.
■■Pregnant women in their second and third trimesters should avoid sustained prone and supine
positions. Do not recommend SMR techniques
that require this population to assume prone or
supine positions for prolonged periods.
■■Clients should not perform SMR exercises when
they have a high fever.
■■Clients with a serious illness or an infectious
disease like the flu should not perform SMR
exercises while the condition is present.
■■Do not use SMR techniques on the abdominal
area if a client has hernias or has had recent
abdominal surgery.
■■Do not use SMR over broken bones.
■■Be conservative using SMR on clients with osteoporosis. If you do recommend SMR for this population, choose exercises that do not place direct
pressure on affected areas. For example, instead
of instructing a client to lie on the ground over a
tennis ball to massage her upper back, coach her
to massage this area while standing by placing
the tennis ball between her back and a wall. This
will give her greater control over the amount of
pressure she places on the ball and will reduce
the risk that she will exacerbate her condition.
■■Do not apply direct pressure on varicose veins
when performing SMR exercises.
■■People with certain types of cancer should
avoid SMR. If a client you are working with has
cancer, check with his physician first to obtain
clearance.

should use SMR with a certain client, check with
his physician first to obtain clearance.

ADDITIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS
Here are a few more conditioning and safety tips
to be aware of as you introduce self-myofascial
exercises into clients’ corrective exercise programs:
1. When clients perform self-myofascial release
exercises, watch their body language for any
hints of pain or problems. Watch their facial
expressions for signs of discomfort or unease,
listen to their voices or breathing for indications of distress, and watch their bodies for
signals that they are not comfortable in the
position you have suggested. If clients are
uncomfortable for any reason, change the exercise to ensure that they can relax and will not
harm themselves. Never encourage a client to
try to push through the pain when performing
any form of corrective exercise.
2. As clients experience pain relief from performing self-myofascial release, many will want to
increase the pressure on the area they are massaging. While this is sometimes a good way to
progress a program, it is also important to teach
clients to be wary of applying too much pressure
or staying on a sore spot for too long. Too much
pressure may inadvertently damage the muscle
tissue or the surrounding fascia (Fritz 2013).
3. Some self-myofascial release exercises may
remain in a client’s program for months, or
even years. This is especially true for clients
who are either very dysfunctional or who place
their bodies under heavy physical stress. Long
distance runners, for example, may need to use
the foam roller on their IT bands and glutes
almost daily to ensure that these structures
recover from their high-intensity running
programs.

Review of Key Points
Self-myofascial release techniques are used at the outset of a client’s program to rejuvenate
and regenerate unhealthy muscles and other soft tissues to prepare for later stretching and
strengthening exercises. These self-massage techniques can be performed using minimal
and low-cost equipment in the gym, at home, in the office, or on the road, and they should
be done regularly to address the underlying causes of musculoskeletal issues.
■■Two types of self-myofascial release techniques are described in this chapter, general

and specific.


Self-Myofascial Release

■■Foam rollers or massage tools with a big surface area are ideal for performing general

self-myofascial release techniques, which target large areas of the body at once.
■■Tennis balls, baseballs, lacrosse balls, cricket balls, massage balls and sticks, and Thera-

canes are massage tools with a smaller surface area that are used for targeting specific
soft tissue knots and adhesions.
■■Understanding a client’s musculoskeletal imbalances and functional anatomy is essential

to knowing what myofascial structures need addressing with self-massage.
■■Although there are many documented benefits to the use of self-myofascial release

techniques, there are also times when it is not appropriate to use them. Be aware of
these important considerations so that the techniques you recommend will be beneficial.
■■There are many ways to progress and regress self-myofascial release exercises. Watch

clients’ movements as they perform each technique to ensure that they will be able to
perform it correctly at home. If you foresee any difficulties with an exercise, regress it
or use an alternative.
