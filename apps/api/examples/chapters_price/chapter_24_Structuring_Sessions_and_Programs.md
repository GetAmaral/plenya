CHAPTER 24
Structuring Sessions
and Programs
After you sign a client up for your services, you will
begin the process of developing a comprehensive
corrective exercise program to address his underlying musculoskeletal imbalances. Just as you and
your client would have experienced the consultation
process differently, each of you will also have different psychological needs and practical requirements
with regard to the design and application of his
program. Understanding these needs (and the best
way to satisfy them) will ensure that individual exercise sessions, and the program as a whole, progress
smoothly and successfully.

BEGINNING AND
BUILDING PROGRAMS
To create and deliver exercise sessions and complete programs, you must understand the process
from a typical client’s perspective as well as from
your own. The following section will explore these
different points of view. It will also cover practical
considerations and tips for beginning and building
a successful program.

CLIENT’S PERSPECTIVE
Your new client will now feel much more comfortable working with you as a result of her positive
consultation experience. However, she will still have
concerns when she arrives for her first appointment

about whether the program will be effective. To help
your client overcome these lingering fears, begin the
first session by
■■reminding her of the step-by-step nature of the

program,
■■emphasizing the importance of regular adherence to her homework, and
■■restating the realistic expectations you set up
together during the consultation process (Shah
and Gardner 2008).
Continue by starting the self-myofascial exercise
portion of your session as planned, but refrain from
discussing the more complex exercises that will be
introduced later. As the client progresses with her
first session and begins to feel results, her confidence in her ability to perform more challenging
activities will grow (Caissy 1998). Later sessions
will become more motivating as her musculoskeletal
health improves, and then you can begin sharing
your plans for advancing her program.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, sometimes clients who have been unsuccessful at resolving their musculoskeletal problems in the past will
unconsciously set themselves up to fail with your
program. This is because humans are creatures of
habit—we tend to repeat the same behaviors rather
than make necessary (and sometimes difficult)
changes to reach our goals (Berdik 2012). These
clients may not be aware that they are sabotaging

361

their own efforts. For example, consider a new
client with severe hip pain who has tried other
pain reduction programs such as physical therapy,
chiropractic, and acupuncture. Although the other
professionals offered treatments that should have
brought relief, the client continued to experience
pain and dysfunction. When you ask him why the
other programs did not work, he tells you that he
has no idea why. When you probe further, you learn
that he was not willing to adjust or stop doing those
activities that caused pain (e.g., running five miles
a day). Based on this new information, you now
understand that his frequent running was partly
to blame for the failure of his previous treatments,
and it may also sidetrack your program. In such a
case, it is your job not only to provide appropriate
corrective exercises, but also to help the client to
identify behavioral and lifestyle changes he needs
to make to ensure that his program succeeds
(Bandura 1986).

YOUR PERSPECTIVE
Your main objective at this initial stage of the
program is to address clients’ problems as rapidly
as possible. You want them to start to experience
noticeable improvements, which will deepen their
commitment and trust in you, your services, and
the program. However, you may be anxious about
performing well during this crucial meeting, and
it can have adverse effects (Skovholt and TrotterMathison 2016).
The way you behave during your first corrective
exercise session with a new client sets the tone for
how you will continue to work together. At this stage,
you both know the initial consultation went well,
and you left that meeting feeling optimistic. Now
you may feel an enormous amount of pressure to
make sure your client stays happy and also quickly
sees results. So you might talk a lot, or you might
try to do too much in the initial session. This can
be overwhelming for the client, and it may create
unrealistic expectations about what a single session
should look like. Therefore, in the first session and
in all later sessions, it is vital to
■■remain calm,
■■use communication strategies that reduce the

client’s anxieties, such as avoiding technical
jargon, and
■■follow The BioMechanics Method structured
exercise selection and design process (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

PRACTICAL
CONSIDERATIONS FOR
BEGINNING AND BUILDING
PROGRAMS
As you build corrective exercise programs and structure the sessions, there are many things to take into
account to ensure a productive series of meetings
and promote mutually beneficial relationships with
your clients.

ESTABLISHING INITIAL
PROGRAM VARIABLES
During the initial consultation wrap-up, you will
have given your prospective client an overview of a
general corrective exercise program. You will have
explained that it progresses from self-myofascial
release techniques to stretching and then to
strengthening. This does not mean, however, that
you need to use all of these modalities in every
session. If someone has chronic or long-standing
myofascial restrictions, for instance, then you may
spend the first two to five sessions doing only selfmyofascial release exercises before you move on to
any stretching (Price and Bratcher 2010).
Once you start working with a client, you will be
able to evaluate his ability to perform certain movements. With this information, you can determine
which corrective exercises are most appropriate
and how long you will need to concentrate on each
modality before progressing to the next technique.
After you have evaluated the client’s abilities
and established your plan of action for a session,
share your plan with the client. Toward the end of
that session, assign appropriate corrective exercise
homework, and outline your plan for the following
session. Letting your clients know what to expect at
each stage of the program will keep them motivated
to perform their homework activities so they can
make progress (Shah and Gardner 2008).

TIMEKEEPING
Regardless of what you do during a session, you
must work within the time frame designated for each
appointment. Predetermined session time frames
are crucial for two reasons:
1. When clients know how long a session will
last, they can better manage their time for the
appointment itself and their other commitments.


Structuring Sessions and Programs

2. Keeping an appointment to its specified time
gives you clear parameters for managing the
session content.
If you do not stick to your predetermined time
frames, clients can become dissatisfied (Salvo
2016). Imagine you are working with a client and
the session is going very well. Since you are making
great progress, you decide to extend the session
by 20 minutes because you do not have anyone
scheduled during the next appointment block. You
think you are doing the client a favor by giving
her extra time and attention. In actuality, you are
creating the expectation that she will receive extra
time whenever you do not have someone booked
immediately after her. Then when you cannot or
choose not to give her extra time in the future, she
will feel cheated.

PROVIDING CLEAR
INSTRUCTIONS
Clients must learn to do their exercises correctly
so they can do them well both in your presence and
for homework. Following are some important points
about giving exercise instructions.
■■Always address clients’ learning styles when you
present new exercises, and link the benefits of
each exercise back to the reason they came to
see you (Winnick and Porretta 2017). For example, if a client wants to be able to bend down and
pick up a child without his back hurting, link the
benefits of doing the exercise you have chosen
to that activity.
■■Once a client understands an exercise and can
do it correctly, have her perform it again and
explain to you what movements she is making.
For instance, a client performing the Butt Lift
exercise may cue herself to keep her pelvis neutral and lift up using her butt muscles. As she
describes her movements, make a mental note
of the words she uses (or write them down), and
use them in her homework instructions. Using
the client’s own wording allows you to incorporate her learning style into the instructions and
verify that she understands what is required
(Dempsey and Sales 1993).
■■If a client forgets how to perform or fails to
describe an exercise correctly, remind him of
the technique and tell him you will add those
instructions to his homework to help him
remember. That way he can focus on learning the exercise now without worrying about
whether he will forget it later.

■■As the client performs each exercise, use a

phone or digital camera to take a picture (or
video if needed) of him performing it to include
with his homework instructions.
■■Once clients are confident they can do an exercise correctly on their own, discuss performance
frequency and duration. Consider how much
time they said during the initial consultation
that they could spend on homework exercises.
Make sure the number of exercises, sets, and
reps fits into that time frame. A homework
program that is outside the client’s level of
commitment will only result in nonadherence
(Price 2016).
■■Toward the end of each session, write down
the mutually agreed-upon homework exercise
instructions with the client present. Using session time to devise homework plans gives your
clients every opportunity to understand what
they need to do to reach their goals (Gallahue
and Donnelly 2003).
■■Print the photos you took during the session to
accompany the instructions, or text or email
them to the client the same day.
■■Even though you will ask clients for input and
feedback, it is your responsibility to make sure
the homework instructions are clear and accurate (Bosworth 2010). For detailed information
on how to teach each corrective exercise modality correctly, refer to chapters 15, 16, and 17.
■■The use of customized client program workbooks can help clients to manage their homework instructions and consolidate program
information. For more information on creating
client program workbooks, refer to chapter 25.

where Justin talks about strategies for successful cueing.

EXERCISE REGRESSIONS,
PROGRESSIONS, AND
ALTERNATIVES
Occasionally, you and a client may disagree on
whether they are ready to perform an exercise on
their own. If clients are confident they can do the
exercise, encourage them to do it, as long as they
are not in danger of hurting themselves. But offer
them a regression or an alternative movement in
case they have problems. This will help build their

363

self-confidence (Price and Bratcher 2010). Similarly,
if you think someone will master his homework exercise quickly, offer a progression he can move on to
before his next session with you. He will feel like an
enormous success when you review his achievements
and discuss further progressions.
When choosing exercises and designing programs, consider any obstacles that may prevent clients from doing the exercises on their own regularly.
Some clients will have demanding work or travel
days, for example. On those days, they will not be
able to commit the normal amount of time to their
homework. For these people, create a shorter program for those busier days. Alternatives like these
will enable clients to continue to make progress even
when other commitments compete for their time
(Price and Bratcher 2010). For more information on
how to progress, regress, and find alternatives for
different types of corrective exercises, see chapters
15, 16, and 17.

MONITORING AND
PROGRESSING PROGRAMS
Assigning homework is a vital part of achieving
results and keeping corrective exercise programs
moving forward. Therefore, beginning with the
second session, always review the homework exercises you have given your clients, even if they tell you
they have been doing their homework consistently
and have no questions. Take as long as you need to
do this at the start of each session, and make sure
the exercises are being performed correctly. There
are three reasons that this is important:
1. It enables you to observe their technique and
give positive feedback on their progress.
2. It provides you with an opportunity to build
their confidence.
3. You can highlight those behaviors and decisions
you want the client to adapt as their own (Hale
and Crisfield 2004).

Beginning and Building Programs: Keys to Success
• If a client arrives on time for an

appointment, never start the session
late. If you have trouble with time
management, stagger your appointments
so you have enough time at the end of
each session to wrap up properly, but
still enough wiggle room to begin the
following session on time (Lynch 1992).

• If unavoidable circumstances result in you
running a couple of minutes late, tell your
next client that you will begin her session
shortly. This helps waiting clients to know
what to expect and helps the session to
begin on a positive note.

• Do not conduct any part of a corrective

exercise session in a busy place where
people typically gather, such as near
a drinking fountain, or where other
activities occur at the same time (Griffin
2006). Corrective exercises require a lot
of concentration, and clients need to be
able to focus.

• Give clients exercises that they can feel

confident performing, and move forward
with small steps to ensure success at
each stage (Price 2016).

• Do not assume or take a client’s word

that homework exercises have been done
correctly. If a client has been doing them
incorrectly, they may be doing more harm
than good (Roberts 1992). Therefore, it is
essential to always review homework.

• Running sessions to the last minute will

not give you enough time to prepare your
client’s homework, so be sure to leave
time for this. If you finish the homework
planning before the session is due to end,
spend the remaining time reviewing what
the client has done during that session or
what to expect in the next one (Price and
Bratcher 2010).

• Do not be vague when scripting

homework. Even if they say they can
remember everything, people often
forget details when they later try
to replicate an exercise. Incorrectly
completed homework exercises can slow
program progress (Gallahue and Donnelly
2003).


Structuring Sessions and Programs

For example, if during the review process a client
says they discovered another tight spot toward the
front of the thigh while performing the Foam Roller
IT Band exercise for homework, you could commend
him on his discovery. Then you could suggest he
target that area by adding the Foam Roller Quadriceps to his program, and you could explain why this
additional exercise would help. Reviewing homework
also helps you to determine whether new exercises
should be added based on the client’s progress.

At the end of every session, schedule the next
appointment and tell clients what you would like
them to do between meetings. If you book the next
appointment in a week, for example, you might suggest that the client do the homework at least five to
six times before then (assuming the client has communicated to you that they are willing to do their
homework almost every day). Scheduling a future
appointment at the end of a current session also helps
to reinforce the client’s commitment to the program.

Review of Key Points
You will probably spend a lot of time working with each client throughout the course of a corrective exercise program, so it is important to create working relationships that foster trust
and mutual respect. You must also pay close attention to your client’s mental and physical
needs, and facilitate their programs accordingly.
■■Creating productive corrective exercise programs requires you to approach each client

differently and focus on individual needs. It also requires appropriate teaching strategies
so they understand exactly what they must do to reach their goals.
■■You can alleviate clients’ initial anxieties by taking things slowly, keeping things simple,

and implementing program variables they can achieve.
■■Provide a clear picture of what to expect in each exercise session, and structure your

time accordingly. Follow The BioMechanics Method exercise progression protocol from
self-myofascial release techniques to stretches and then to strengthening.
■■Always link your exercise recommendations to your clients’ goals. For example, if a cli-

ent’s ultimate goal is to be able to play tennis again, explain how each exercise relates
to movements he will need on the tennis court.
■■Progress a program when you feel a client is ready. Appropriate progressions keep clients

motivated about moving forward.
■■If a client is having difficulty mastering an exercise, it is your job to notice this before

she becomes frustrated or hurts herself. Whenever necessary, regress the exercise to
help maintain the client’s confidence in herself and in the program.
■■All information about a client’s homework (whether exercise-related or not) should be

recorded in a personalized workbook. Pictures (and videos if appropriate) should be
taken of all homework exercises, and clear instructions should be provided so the client
knows exactly what is expected.

Self-Check
The following table contains four sample exercises from the exercise library (chapters 19,
20, and 21). For each exercise, identify different cueing strategies you could use to teach
the exercise based on your evaluation of whether a client is predominantly a visual, verbal,
or kinesthetic learner. Then identify two ways to progress, two ways to regress, and two
alternatives for each exercise. A sample has been provided.
