# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 21: Strengthening Exercises

CHAPTER 21
Strengthening Exercises
Strengthening exercises are the ultimate progression of a client’s corrective exercise program.
They are only introduced after the regular application of stretching and self-myofascial release
techniques to soft tissue structures (Clark and
Lucett 2011; Price 2013; Price and Bratcher 2010).
Strengthening exercises help recondition, retrain,
and build up soft tissue structures that have been
hampered by imbalances. The goal is to retrain the
neuromuscular, myofascial, and musculoskeletal
systems to correct problems and safeguard the
body from future harm (Hoffman 2014; Houglum
2016).
Selecting, designing, progressing, and regressing a corrective strengthening program appropriately will help improve stability, increase mobility,
and restore coordination to previously painful and
injured parts (McGill 2016; Price and Bratcher
2010). Musculoskeletal imbalances can lead to
compensations and dysfunctional movement patterns that will affect how people perform their
strengthening exercises (Clark and Lucett 2011).
So you must choose exercises that are within your
clients’ abilities and make sure that they do them
correctly. Otherwise, existing musculoskeletal
imbalances could be exacerbated, or the wrong
soft tissue structures could be stimulated (Price
and Bratcher 2010).

STRENGTHENING
EXERCISE QUICK TIPS
Following is a recap of strategies that you can use
to introduce your clients to strengthening exercises.
■■While it is extremely important to make sure

clients perform their exercises correctly and
safely, give them the latitude to make small
mistakes when they first try a new exercise.
This will enable you to offer feedback and help
them to learn how to correct their technique
and make future improvements (Coyle 2009).
■■Use visual, verbal, and kinesthetic teaching cues
to adapt your instruction style to your clients’
learning styles (Wrisberg 2007).
■■Always explain why you are recommending a
particular strengthening exercise. Emphasize
how each strengthening exercise builds on the
self-myofascial release techniques and stretching exercises a client has already performed.
■■Regress a strengthening exercise if a client
experiences discomfort performing the movement, has difficulty performing the exercise
correctly, or experiences excessive soreness
after a session (Bryant and Green 2010).
■■Regress a strengthening exercise by introducing
a less challenging movement, incorporating

props such as balance aids, or revisiting a
self-myofascial release or stretching exercise.
■■Progress a strengthening program if a client has
reached a certain level of proficiency, needs to
combine exercises to save time, or has made
more ambitious goals.
■■Progress a strengthening exercise by introducing a more dynamic movement, using fewer
props, adding external loads to the movement,
or incorporating multiple planes of movement
(Magee, Zachazewski, and Quillen 2007; Price
and Bratcher 2010).

Reminder
Review the comprehensive information on
teaching tips, progressions and regressions,
and when not to use strengthening exercises
provided in chapter 17 before introducing any
of the exercises in this chapter into a client’s
corrective exercise program.


Strengthening Exercises

STRENGTHENING EXERCISE LIBRARY
The strengthening exercises highlighted in this chapter are designed to be progressive (i.e.,
from isolated to integrated, concentric to eccentric, single joint to multijoint, one plane to
multiple planes, and open chain to closed chain) and easy to perform in a gym setting, at
home, at the office, or when traveling, with little or no equipment required.

293


Big Toe Pushdowns
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, and lack of dorsiflexion
Structures addressed: Structures that make up the medial longitudinal arch
of the foot, specifically flexor hallucis longus
Exercise benefits: Habitual overpronation can put excessive stress on the
structures of the medial side of the foot and ankle, particularly the medial longitudinal arch. This exercise strengthens the structures that help support this
arch to help the foot resist overpronation, promote dorsiflexion, and slow down
the knee as it moves toward the midline of the body.
How to perform
1. Stand with your feet facing forward, and raise the medial longitudinal arch
to create a neutral position of the feet and ankles (i.e., the weight will shift
slightly toward the outside of the foot).
2. Align the toes so they are straight, and push the big toe down toward the
floor without “scrunching” the other toes.
3. Perform this exercise isometrically at fi rst, then add movement by gently
rocking forward and backward, using the big toe as a braking mechanism
to control the body weight as it moves over the foot.

294


Duration and repetitions: Perform an isometric contraction for 20 to 30
seconds, and repeat 2 to 3 times at least once per day, progressing to dynamic
movements of 10 to 15 repetitions.
Tip: When you perform this exercise correctly, you should feel the muscles
under the arch working as the big toe is pushed down.
Precaution: Progress this exercise gradually to avoid overtaxing the muscles
because this could lead to cramping.
Progress: Rock the body back and forward over the feet.

Regress: Scrunch up a towel with the toes to help activate the flexor hallucis
longus muscle or perform the Golf Ball Roll.

295


Lying Pelvic Tilt
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Rectus abdominis, gluteus maximus, and hamstrings
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps to strengthen muscles that flex the
lumbar spine and posteriorly rotate the pelvis, for the purpose of helping to
mobilize this area and promote better movement.
How to perform
1. Lie on the floor with your knees bent.
2. Flatten your lower back by tilting the pelvis under, and contract the abdominals to pull the pubic bone up toward the bottom of the rib cage.
3. Do not let the shoulders and upper back round off the floor as the pelvis
is tilted.

296


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 15 repetitions at least once per day.
Tip: Do not let the pelvis anteriorly rotate as the tailbone comes off the ground.
Precaution: Perform this exercise gently and slowly at first to help the structures of the lower back to adapt.
Progress: Perform the Gluteal Activation Over Ball or the Butt Lift.

Regress: Massage the glutes with a tennis ball or foam roller, or perform the
One Tennis Ball on Lower Back.

297


Duck Stand
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt, and
excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Gluteus maximus, iliotibial band, rectus abdominis,
and posterior fibers of gluteus medius
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen the muscles that assist with
rotating the legs outward (thus raising the arches of the feet and aligning the
knee with the feet and ankles) and tilting the pelvis posteriorly. It also helps
flex the lumbar spine to decrease lumbar lordosis.
How to perform
1. Begin by standing on both feet with your heels together and your feet and
legs rotated out like a duck.
2. Tilt the pelvis posteriorly (i.e., tuck it under), and contract the gluteus
maximus muscle to further rotate the legs outward.
3. As the legs rotate outward, feel the arches of the feet rise up and the weight
shift to the outsides of the feet and toward the heels.

298


Duration and repetitions: Hold the contraction isometrically for 15 to 20
seconds, and repeat the cycle at least 3 times once per day.
Tip: Drive your heels into the ground, and keep your torso erect.
Precaution: If you have discomfort in your knees, straighten your feet so that
they are not turned out so much. If pain persists, stop performing the exercise.
Progress: Perform Big Toe Pushdowns dynamically or the Gluteal Activation
Over Ball.

Regress: Perform the Lying Pelvic Tilt or the Foam Roller Gluteal Complex.

299


Gluteal Activation Over Ball
Area(s) of body: Lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt, and
excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen the glutes and retrain the
lumbo-pelvic hip girdle so that the hip and leg complex can go into extension
(i.e., take the leg behind the body) without “cheating” by anteriorly tilting the
pelvis or overarching the lower back.
How to perform
1. Lie on top of a stability ball with the pelvis in the center of the ball, hands
resting on the floor and eyes looking down to avoid excessive arching of
the neck.
2. Rest one foot on the ground to stabilize the body as the pelvis is tilted
posteriorly to flex the lumbar spine.
3. Dorsiflex the other foot and rotate the leg outward, keeping that leg straight.
4. Slowly lift the straight leg up and tilt the pelvis to activate the glutes and
keep the lower back from arching.
5. Lower the leg back down a few inches, and then raise it again.
6. Repeat on the opposite side.

300


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 15 repetitions on each side at least
once per day.
Tip: Most people with lumbar lordosis will try to lift the leg by arching the lower
back, so watch for this compensation. Also, rotating the lifting leg inward and
outward will strengthen different fibers of the gluteal muscles.
Precaution: Do not try to move the leg by rotating or tipping the pelvis to one
side.
Progress: Perform the Butt Lift.

Regress: Perform Lying Pelvic Tilt or Duck Stand.

301


Butt Lift
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt, and
excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Gluteus maximus, rectus abdominis, and erector spinae
Exercise benefits: Strengthening the glutes and spinal erectors and teaching
the hip and leg complex to extend correctly will train the entire lumbo-pelvic
hip girdle to move more effectively without compensating.
How to perform
1. Sit on the floor with knees bent and hands placed behind your body.
2. Align your feet forward with the arches lifted.
3. Posteriorly tilt the pelvis to move it into a neutral position as the hips are
lifted off the floor.
4. Lift through the shoulders to keep your chest up, and keep your chin tucked
as the hips are raised.
5. Slowly lower the hips without touching your butt to the floor while maintaining a neutral pelvic position throughout.

302


Duration and repetitions: Perform the exercise isometrically at first, holding
the up position for 15 to 20 seconds. Progress to 10 to 12 repetitions once per day.
Tip: If a client has shoulder or wrist problems, use a stability ball to support
the head and shoulders during this exercise.
Precaution: Most people with an anterior pelvic tilt and excessive lumbar lordosis will overarch their backs as they lift the hips during this exercise. Coach
these clients to maintain a neutral pelvic position throughout the exercise by
posteriorly tilting the pelvis.
Progress: Perform the Lunge With Knee Pull.

Regress: Perform the Lying Pelvic Tilt or the Gluteal Activation Over Ball.

303


Side Lying Leg Lift
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees, lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, and anterior pelvic tilt
Structures addressed: Abductor muscles and deep hip rotators
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps to stabilize the pelvis and promote a
more neutral position for the hip, thereby creating better alignment and movement of the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle, legs, knees, and feet.
How to perform
1. Lie on your side with a half foam roller or pillow under your neck to keep
the head in line with the spine.
2. Straighten the bottom leg, rest the instep of the top foot on the calf of the
bottom leg, and lower the knee toward the ground.
3. Posteriorly rotate the pelvis, keeping the hips stacked vertically on top of
each other.
4. Slowly lift the top knee up and down without arching the lower back, hiking
the hip, or anteriorly rotating the pelvis.

304


Duration and repetitions: Perform the exercise isometrically at first by lifting
and holding the leg in the top position for 20 to 30 seconds and repeating 2 to
3 times. Progress to 10 to 12 repetitions once per day.
Tip: If clients do not feel the contraction in the sides of their glutes, gently add
resistance to the lowering (eccentric) phase of the movement to help activate
those muscles.
Precaution: Watch for the following three compensations during the leg lifting phase of this exercise: hiking of the hip, anteriorly rotating the pelvis, and
rotating the torso.
Progress: Perform the Lunge With Side Reach.

Regress: Perform the Abductor Stretch or Duck Stand.

305


Shoulder Retraction on Floor
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle, elevated
scapula, and internally rotated arms
Structures addressed: Rhomboids, trapezius (middle and lower fibers), thoracic extensors, infraspinatus, and teres minor
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps to strengthen the muscles that extend
the thoracic spine and retract and depress the scapula. It also strengthens the
rotator cuff muscles that help to externally rotate the arm and position the
humerus correctly in the glenohumeral joint.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with knees bent and your head on a pillow or folded towel
(if needed) to make sure the neck is in a neutral position.
2. Place your arms out to the sides abducted approximately 45 degrees away
from the body, with palms facing up.
3. Pull your shoulders back and down to the floor, keeping the pelvis posteriorly rotated to ensure that your lower back stays in contact with the floor
and does not arch during the movement.

306


Duration and repetitions: Perform an isometric contraction for 20 to 30
seconds 2 to 3 times per day.
Tip: If a client cannot feel the muscles that retract and depress the shoulder
blades activate, use another strengthening exercise like the Seated Row or the
Straight Arm Pulldown (detailed later in this chapter) to help activate them,
and then return to this exercise.
Progress: Perform The Flasher or The Wave Goodbye.

Regress: Perform the Why Stretch or the Front of Shoulder Massage.

307


Straight Arm Pulldown
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, head and neck
Imbalance(s): Elevated scapula and protracted shoulder girdle
Structures addressed: Trapezius muscle (lower fibers) and rhomboids
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen the lower fibers of the
trapezius to help depress the scapula and pull it closer to the spine. Also, if
the lower fibers of the trapezius are strong and active, it can take stress off the
upper fibers, where many people hold excessive tension.
How to perform
1. Sit on a gym ball or on the seat of a lat pulldown machine, and reach up to
grasp the bar or handles of suspended tubing.
2. Pull the shoulder blades back and down without bending the arms (this
uses the lower traps and rhomboids).
3. Do not engage the lats by bending the arms.

308


Duration and repetitions: Perform an isometric contraction for 20 to 30
seconds, and repeat 2 to 3 times before progressing to dynamic movements of
10 to 15 repetitions.
Tip: If there is difficulty in performing this movement or in being aware of the
lower fibers of the trapezius contracting, do one arm at a time first to help you
to feel the muscles that should be working.
Progress: Perform the Straight Arm Raise

Regress: Perform the Tennis Ball Around Shoulder Blade.

309


Seated Row
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine and shoulder girdle, neck and head
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle, elevated
scapula, internally rotated arms, and forward head
Structures addressed: Erector spinae group, rhomboids, trapezius, latissimus
dorsi
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen the muscles that keep the
thoracic spine erect and pull the head back as well as those muscles that retract,
depress, and stabilize the shoulder blades. Strengthening these muscles can have
a positive impact on the head and neck, thoracic spine, shoulder girdle, and arms.
How to perform
1. Sit up straight on a chair or rowing machine.
2. Grasp the handles of an elastic tube or the rowing machine and pull them
toward your torso in a rowing motion.
3. Keep your shoulders back and down, and do not arch your lower back excessively during the movement.
4. Keep your head in line with the spine, and keep your chin tucked in.
5. Return the handles to the starting position and repeat without leaning
forward.

310


Duration and repetitions: Perform an isometric contraction for 10 to 15
seconds, and repeat 2 to 3 times before progressing to dynamic movements of
10 to 15 repetitions.
Tip: When the elbows come in line with the sides of the ribcage, stop pulling.
Going farther back may cause the shoulder blades to elevate, and this will defeat
the purpose of the exercise.
Precaution: Coach clients to bend at the hips as they reach forward to avoid
excessive rounding of the spine.
Progress: Perform this exercise standing.

Regress: Perform the Shoulder Retraction on Floor.

311


The Flasher (Lying)
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine, shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive cervical lordosis, forward head, excessive thoracic
kyphosis, protracted shoulder girdle, elevated scapula, and internally rotated
arms
Structures addressed: Erector spinae group, muscles that flex the neck,
muscles that retract the head (when performed standing), infraspinatus, teres
minor, rhomboids, and trapezius
Exercise benefits: This exercise strengthens the muscles that keep the torso
and head erect, retract and depress the shoulder blades, and externally rotate
the arm. It also stretches the muscles in the front of the chest and shoulder.
How to perform
1. Lie on your back with your arms bent, elbows close to the sides, and fi ngers
pointing toward the ceiling, using a pillow to support your head if needed.
2. Pull the shoulder blades back and down.
3. Externally rotate the arms by bringing the backs of the hands toward the
floor.
4. The movement should be felt between the shoulder blades and in the backs
of the arms near the top of each arm.

312


Duration and repetitions: Perform the exercise isometrically at first, holding
the contracted position for 15 to 20 seconds and repeating 2 to 3 times. Progress
to 10 to 15 repetitions for 2 to 3 sets, 3 to 4 times per week.
Tip: To achieve better full-body posture during this exercise, teach clients to
do it while standing against a wall. Coach them to obtain a neutral foot position,
posteriorly rotate the pelvis, stand erect, and tuck their chins in before and
throughout the movement.
Precaution: If discomfort is felt at the front of the shoulder, raise the elbows
off the floor with a rolled-up towel; check for proper technique, and regress the
exercise if necessary.
Progress: Perform this exercise standing, or add resistance with an exercise band.

Regress: Perform this exercise one side at a time while lying on the ground,
placing a pillow under the elbows and a foam roller to the side of the shoulder
to decrease the range of motion required before the back of the hand makes
contact with the roller.

313


The Wave Goodbye (Lying)
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine, shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive cervical lordosis, excessive thoracic kyphosis, internally rotated arms, protracted shoulder girdle, and elevated scapula
Structures addressed: Erector spinae group, muscles that flex the neck,
muscles that retract the head (when performed standing), infraspinatus, teres
minor, rhomboids, and trapezius
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen the muscles that externally
rotate the arm and stabilize the scapula while the spine and head are in proper
alignment.
How to perform
1. Lie on the floor with the lower back flat to the floor with elbows raised to
shoulder height and bent, palms facing the feet, and fi ngers pointing toward
the ceiling, using a pillow to support the head and neck if needed.
2. Pull your shoulder blades back and down to the floor, tucking your chin in
so that the neck does not arch backward to the floor.
3. Slowly press the backs of your hands against the floor, keeping your shoulders back and down.

314


Duration and repetitions: Perform the exercise isometrically, holding the
contracted position for 15 to 20 seconds and repeating 2 to 3 times. Progress
to 10 to 15 repetitions for 2 to 3 sets, 3 to 4 times per week.
Tip: Keep the pelvis posteriorly rotated throughout to stop the lower back from
overarching and to engage the thoracic extensors.
Precaution: Clients who have excessive thoracic kyphosis may shrug their
shoulders as they rotate their arms. Coach them to engage their lower traps to
help depress their shoulder blades.
Progress: Perform this exercise standing, or add resistance with tubing. Clients
should be able to complete 10 to 15 repetitions with good form before adding
resistance.

Regress: Use a pillow to support the elbows and a foam roller above the head to
decrease the range of movement needed, or perform the Theracane on Trapezius.

315


Straight Arm Raise (Lying)
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine, shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive thoracic kyphosis, elevated scapula
Structures addressed: Erector spinae group, muscles that flex the neck, muscles that retract the head (when performed standing), rhomboids, and trapezius
Exercise benefits: This exercise teaches clients to engage their thoracic
extensors and disengage their lumbar extensors to encourage better thoracic
extension and discourage excessive lumbar lordosis. It also strengthens the
muscles that stabilize the scapula to prevent excessive “shrugging” when using
the arms.
How to perform
1. Lie on the floor with your knees bent, your arms by your sides, and your
pelvis posteriorly rotated.
2. Slowly raise your arms up over your head, keeping the arms straight and
keeping the muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade engaged.
3. Make sure the lower back does not arch excessively during the movement.

316


Duration and repetitions: Perform this exercise isometrically at first, holding the
raised arm position for 10 to 15 seconds, and repeat 2 to 3 times. Progress to 10 to
15 repetitions raising and lowering the arms for 2 to 3 sets, 2 to 3 times per week.
Tip: Many people may arch their backs excessively when lifting their arms over
their heads. Coach them to keep the pelvis posteriorly tilted and to extend the spine
using their upper back muscles (thoracic extensors).
Precaution: Two compensations to watch for when clients perform this exercise
are shrugging the shoulders and bending the arms. Regress this exercise when
needed to ensure correct technique.
Progress: Perform this exercise standing, or perform the Back Step With Arm Raise.

Regress: Use a foam roller above your head to decrease the amount of movement
needed, or perform the Front of Shoulder Massage.

317


Neck Flexion
Area(s) of body: Neck and head
Imbalance(s): Excessive cervical lordosis, forward head
Structures addressed: Muscles that flex the neck and retract the head
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen the muscles that help pull the
head back while keeping the eyes parallel to the horizon to reduce unnecessary
stress caused by excessive cervical lordosis and a forward head.
How to perform
1. Stand against a wall, or sit in a chair with torso erect (do not overarch
lower back).
2. Pull your chin in and your head back to lengthen the back of the neck.
3. Keep your shoulders back and down and your pelvis tucked throughout
the exercise.

318


Duration and repetitions: Perform this exercise isometrically at first, and
hold the position 10 to 15 seconds and repeat 2 to 3 times. Progress to 6 to 10
repetitions at least once per day.
Tip: This exercise can be performed at the office, while driving, or at any time
to help keep the muscles of your neck strong, flexible, and mobile.
Progress: Perform this exercise while lying down.

Regress: Use heat, or perform the Theracane on Back of Neck.

319


Extension Crunch
Area(s) of body: Thoracic spine, shoulder girdle
Imbalance(s): Excessive lumbar lordosis, excessive thoracic kyphosis, and
excessive cervical lordosis
Structures addressed: Rectus abdominis, muscles that flex the neck, muscles
that retract the head, and the extensor muscles of the thoracic spine
Exercise benefits: This exercise strengthens the rectus abdominis to rotate
the pelvis posteriorly and to help flex the lumbar spine. It also strengthens the
muscles that flex the neck (while keeping the head back), and it trains the rectus
abdominis to work eccentrically to train the thoracic spine to extend correctly.
How to perform
1. Lie back over a stability ball with your feet up against a wall or your heels
on a table.
2. Place your hands behind your head to support your neck.
3. Posteriorly tilt the pelvis while keeping your shoulders down, your head
back, and your chin tucked in.
4. Gently lie back over the ball, pulling the thoracic spine into extension while
keeping the pelvis posteriorly tilted.
5. Once you are comfortable with this position, lift your torso slightly and then
lower your upper back and head as far back as possible (without arching
the lower back or neck).

320


Duration and repetitions: Perform this exercise isometrically at first, holding the pelvis up while extending the thoracic spine over the ball for 15 to 20
seconds. Progress to 8 to 10 repetitions of slightly lifting and lowering the torso
for 2 to 3 sets, 3 to 4 times per week.
Tip: Hold the ball for clients so they do not feel too unstable.
Precaution: If the lower back gets tight or painful during the exercise, it means
that the client is trying to extend over the ball using the lumbar spine and not
extending the thoracic spine correctly. If this occurs, coach the client in the
correct technique. If pain persists, discontinue this exercise.
Progress: Increase the distance between the ball and the wall to increase
difficulty or perform repetitions.

Regress: Perform the Abdominal Massage.

321


Back Step With Arm Raise
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Lack of dorsiflexion, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and excessive thoracic kyphosis
Structures addressed: Hip flexors, gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, rectus
abdominis, erector spinae group, and muscles of the shoulder complex
Exercise benefits: This exercise strengthens the muscles that help extend
the thoracic spine and stabilize the scapula while simultaneously stretching
the abdominal, hip flexor, and calf muscles so that the legs, hips, and spine can
move together into extension without overarching the lower back.
How to perform
1. Stand with both feet facing forward and your pelvis tucked under.
2. Step back with your right leg while raising your right arm over your head.
3. Do not excessively shrug the shoulder of the arm being raised.
4. Complete the movement on the right side by stepping forward with the right
leg while bringing the arm down; then step backward with the left leg and
raise the left arm to perform the movement on the left side.
5. Repeat on both sides.

322


Duration and repetitions: Perform the exercise isometrically at first, holding the arm up and leg back position for 10 to 15 seconds. Progress to dynamic
movements of 10 to 12 repetitions on both sides 2 to 3 times per week.
Tip: If a client has difficulty performing this movement correctly, check the
flexibility of the gastrocnemius, abdominals, and hip flexor muscles, and address
any issues you find with myofascial release or isolated stretching exercises.
Precaution: If clients experience lower back pain when performing the exercise,
simply instruct them to take a smaller step backward, and ensure that they tilt
the pelvis correctly during the movement.
Progress: Perform the Lunge With Arm Raise.

Regress: Perform the Standing Straight Arm Raise or Abdominal Massage.

323


Lunge With Knee Pull
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, lack of dorsiflexion, valgus knee position, tracking problems of the knee, excessive thoracic kyphosis, and anterior pelvic tilt
Structures addressed: Works the entire kinetic chain, but focuses on the
gluteal muscles, quadriceps group, adductors, erector spinae group, and the
muscles of the lower leg and foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise focuses on eccentrically strengthening the
gluteal muscles, quadriceps, and muscles of the calf and foot. Strengthening these
muscles in this manner enables them to help slow down the knee as it moves
forward and toward the midline. Strengthening the gluteal muscles also helps to
stabilize the pelvis and lower back. When performed with rotation, this exercise
also helps to mobilize the thoracic spine and to strengthen the muscles of the back.
How to perform
1. Step forward into a gentle lunge, making sure both feet are facing forward.
2. Bend at the hips, and grab the front knee with the opposite hand.
3. Pull the pelvis of the front leg back toward the back foot while pulling the
front knee toward the midline of the body.
4. Allow the foot to pronate, but use the flexor hallucis longus (i.e., push the
big toe down) to help stabilize the front foot and prevent overpronation.
5. Keep the spine straight—lean forward at the hips and do not round the
spine—until you feel the glute on the leg that is forward activate.

324


Duration and repetitions: Perform this exercise isometrically at first, holding the lunge position for 5 to 10 seconds, and repeat 2 to 3 times. Progress to
dynamic movements of 8 to 12 repetitions on both sides 2 to 3 times per week.
Tip: Rotating the torso back and away from the front leg will also help activate
the glute.
Precaution: If clients experience pain in their lower back or knees, regress to
a suitable self-myofascial release or stretching exercise.
Progress: Rotate the torso farther away from the front leg, and extend the arm
on the same side as the front leg behind you.

Regress: Perform the Glute Stretch or the Lying Rotation Stretch.

325


Lunge With Arm Raise
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, lack of dorsiflexion, valgus knee position, tracking problems of the knee, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and
excessive thoracic kyphosis
Structures addressed: Works entire kinetic chain but focuses on gluteal muscles, hip flexor group, quadriceps group, adductors, abdominals, erector spinae
group, obliques, and muscles of the lower leg and foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps retrain the major muscles and structures of the body to transition correctly from flexion to extension as the hips,
spine, and torso rotate. Learning to coordinate these movements correctly will
address nearly all of the most common musculoskeletal imbalances.
How to perform
1. Step forward into a gentle lunge, leaning forward and rotating slightly to
reach the arm opposite the leg that is forward, across toward the front knee,
while reaching the other arm backward.
2. Return from the lunge, rotating the torso upright and back.
3. Raise the same arm that was previously reaching forward above the head
and behind the body without shrugging the shoulder, while rotating the
opposite arm across the torso.
4. Try to keep the feet facing forward throughout this exercise; reposition
them to face forward as needed.
5. Repeat the movement, rotating down and forward to up and back.

326


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 15 repetitions on both sides once per
day. (Increase to 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions as a client’s ability improves,
but decrease the frequency that this exercise is performed to allow adequate
rest and recovery between sessions.)
Tip: This exercise is an integration of many exercises previously learned. If a
client has difficulty with any part, simply break this exercise down into its parts
and perform them separately. For example, performing the Lunge With Knee
Pull will help with the forward lunge part of the exercise, and performing the
Step Back With Arm Raise will help with the second part.
Progress: Perform the exercise holding light dumbbells.

Regress: Perform the Straight Arm Raise or the Foam Roller Hip Flexors.

327


Lunge With Side Reach
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, tracking problems of the
knee, anterior pelvic tilt, and excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Works the entire kinetic chain, but focuses on the
muscles that slow down the legs, pelvis, and spine as they move laterally
Exercise benefits: This exercise eccentrically strengthens the muscles that
help slow down the pelvis, leg, and spine as they move from side to side. It also
helps mobilize and strengthen the muscles that control the movement of the
pelvis and spine to mitigate compensation patterns, such as an anterior pelvic
tilt and excessive lumbar lordosis.
How to perform
1. With both feet facing forward, lunge forward gently with the left foot while
reaching the right arm out toward the right side.
2. During the lunging movement, push the left hip to the left (i.e., away from
the right hand) to help keep the body balanced over its center.
3. During this movement, let the left leg move in toward the midline of the body.
4. Stand up to return to the starting position, and reach with the right arm
over the head toward the left, pushing the hips toward the right side of
your body.
5. Repeat the movement, transitioning from side lunge to overhead reach.

328


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 15 repetitions on both sides once per
day. (Increase to 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions as a client’s ability improves,
but decrease the frequency that this exercise is performed to allow adequate
rest and recovery between sessions.)
Tip: Placing the left hand on the left-side gluteal complex (if the right hand is
reaching out to the right side) at the beginning of this exercise will enable clients
to feel if the abductor muscles are activating correctly. If they are deficient in
any way you will need to regress this exercise to activate these muscles (e.g.,
perform the Side Lying Leg Lift).
Progress: Perform the exercise holding light dumbbells.

Regress: Use a balance aid or perform the Side Lying Leg Lift.

329


Side Lunge With Rotation
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, tracking problems of the
knee, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and excessive thoracic
kyphosis
Structures addressed: Works the entire kinetic chain, but focuses on gluteal
muscles, quadriceps group, adductors, erector spinae group, obliques, and muscles of the lower leg and foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise focuses on retraining and strengthening the
muscles that help stabilize the leg and pelvis as weight is transferred from one
side of the body to the other. It also helps mobilize and strengthen the structures
of the spine so it can rotate correctly.
How to perform
1. Stand with your feet facing forward and about 24 to 36 inches (60 to 90
cm) apart.
2. Transfer your weight onto one leg, bending the ankle, knee, and hip on that
side to perform a squat.
3. Rotate the arms and torso over the weight-bearing leg during the squat.
4. Return to the standing position and repeat on the other side, learning to
transfer weight from side to side as the trunk rotates.

330


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 15 repetitions at least once per day.
(Increase to 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions as a client’s ability improves, but
decrease the frequency that this exercise is performed to allow adequate rest
and recovery between sessions.)
Tip: Coach clients to imagine that they are ice skating as they transfer weight
from side to side to help them visualize or feel the desired movement.
Precaution: If clients complain of back or knee pain when performing this
exercise, coach them to place their hands on a balance aid in front of them and
only to incorporate the torso rotation when they are ready to progress.
Progress: Perform with one leg at a time, with the opposite leg on a gym ball.

Regress: Perform the Lying Rotation Stretch or the Side Lying Leg Lift

331


The Pivot
Area(s) of body: Feet and ankles, knees, and lumbo-pelvic hip girdle
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, anterior pelvic tilt, and
excessive lumbar lordosis
Structures addressed: Works the entire lower kinetic chain but focuses primarily on the gluteal muscles, the hip flexor group, the quadriceps group, the
adductors, and the muscles of the lower leg and foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise helps strengthen all the muscles of the lower
body that slow down pronation of the foot, internal rotation of the leg, and
flexion of the hips.
How to perform
1. Stand on the left foot, making sure that it is aligned forward.
2. Keep the torso straight, and do not lean to the side.
3. Lift the right knee and hike the right side of the pelvis to help activate
the left glute (which will help bring the left foot, leg, and hip into better
alignment).
4. Gently bend the left hip, knee, and ankle, and pivot your raised leg down
and backward, letting the left knee shift in toward the midline of the body
and the right leg drop and rotate behind the body.
5. Use the glutes, quadriceps, and muscles of the feet to slow down the left
knee as it bends and the leg and ankle as they rotate inward.
6. Return to the standing position balanced on the left leg with the right knee
raised up and forward.

332


Duration and repetitions: Perform the exercise isometrically at first holding
the starting position balanced over the left leg with the right knee up and forward
to activate the gluteal muscles. Progress to completing the entire movement for
8 to 12 repetitions on both sides for 2 to 3 sets, 2 to 3 times a week.
Tip: The pivoting movement should be controlled by the muscles of the hips,
legs, and feet so that the ankle and knee do not get overly stressed.
Precaution: If pain or discomfort is felt in the knee, stop immediately and
regress to an easier exercise.
Progress: Perform the Lunge To Step Up.

Regress: Tap the ground with the other foot as it goes back to maintain balance,
or use a balance aid.

333


Lunge to Step Up
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, lack of dorsiflexion, valgus knee position, tracking problems of the knee, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and
excessive thoracic kyphosis
Structures addressed: Works the entire kinetic chain, including the gluteal
muscles, the hip flexors, the quadriceps group, the adductors, the erector spinae
group, the obliques, and muscles of the lower leg and foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise mimics gait to help strengthen all the muscles
that both create and slow down hip flexion and hip extension while keeping the
feet, legs, pelvis, and spine stable and functioning correctly.
How to perform
1. With both feet facing forward, step backward into a lunge, tilting the pelvis
under on the back leg and keeping the spine upright to prevent the lower
back from arching too much.
2. Stand up out of the lunge, lifting the back leg off the ground, and placing the
foot of the back leg on a step or a stool placed in front at about knee height.
3. Take the foot off the stool and step back into the lunge to repeat.

334


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 15 repetitions on both sides once per
day. (Increase to 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions as a client’s ability improves,
but decrease the frequency that this exercise is performed to allow adequate
rest and recovery between sessions.)
Tip: Clients should feel the glutes and muscles of the front leg and the hip flexors
of the back leg load eccentrically as they lunge down. Coach them to keep their
feet facing forward to ensure that their legs, hips, and pelvis are aligned correctly.
Progress: Rotate the torso over the front leg as the hip flexes and extends (i.e.,
swing the arms from side to side).

Regress: Perform the Lunge With Knee Pull or the Wall Rotation Stretch.

335


Sumo Squat With Rotation
Area(s) of body: Entire kinetic chain
Imbalance(s): Overpronation, valgus knee position, tracking problems of the
knee, anterior pelvic tilt, excessive lumbar lordosis, and excessive thoracic
kyphosis
Structures addressed: Works the entire kinetic chain, but focuses on the
gluteal muscles, the hip flexor group, the quadriceps group, the adductors, the
erector spinae group, the obliques, the rhomboids, the trapezius, the rotator
cuff group, and muscles of the lower leg and foot
Exercise benefits: This exercise is designed to help strengthen the muscles
around the lumbo-pelvic hip girdle to enable the body to transfer weight from
side to side as the hip rotates internally and externally and as the spine flexes
and extends. Retraining the body to coordinate these movements correctly will
help address many of the common musculoskeletal imbalances of the feet, legs,
hips, pelvis, and spine.
How to perform
1. Stand on the left leg with the right knee raised and the left arm up.
2. Hike the right side of the pelvis slightly to ensure that the left side of the pelvis
is stacked correctly over the left leg and that the left glutes are activated.
3. Rotate the pelvis and torso to the right, using the muscles in the left foot,
leg, and glutes to slow down the left leg and the body as they rotate.
4. Place the right foot on the ground behind the body and squat, allowing the
spine to round as the left arm reaches between the legs toward the right heel.
5. Return to the standing position balanced on the left leg and repeat the movement, performing a rotating squat with a reach between the legs.
6. Repeat on the opposite side.

336


Duration and repetitions: Perform 10 to 12 repetitions on both sides once per
day. (Increase to 2 to 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions as a client’s ability improves,
but decrease the frequency that this exercise is performed to allow adequate
rest and recovery between sessions.)
Tip: This exercise is an integration of many exercises previously learned. If
a client has difficulty with any part, simply break this exercise down into its
parts and perform them separately. For example, The Pivot will help with the
single-leg stand position, and the Side Lunge With Rotation will help strengthen
the muscles that enable the body to transfer weight from side to side.
Progress: Perform the exercise holding a medicine ball.

Regress: Perform the Lower Back Stretch or The Pivot

Review of Key Points
Strengthening exercises are the ultimate goal of a corrective exercise program, and they are
crucial to ensuring that the underlying causes of your client’s musculoskeletal imbalances are
addressed effectively. Strengthening exercises are introduced after the regular application
of self-myofascial release techniques and stretching exercises, and they should be gradually
progressed based on a client’s needs, abilities, and goals.
■■Adding appropriate strengthening exercises to a client’s program will help improve

stability, increase mobility, and restore coordination.
■■Clients with existing musculoskeletal imbalances may perform complex strengthening

movements incorrectly and make their condition worse. Watch them closely as they
perform these exercises, and regress the exercises when appropriate.
■■Always regress a strengthening exercise if a client complains of pain or discomfort.
■■Removing or adding balance aids and incorporating or excluding other body parts are

effective ways to progress or regress strengthening exercises.
■■Using visual, verbal, and kinesthetic teaching cues will help you accommodate the learn-

ing styles of different clients.
■■Do not use strengthening exercises on tissues that surround or cross a fracture site,

tissues that have recently had an acute injury or surgery, or an area that has sustained
trauma.
■■Obtain clearance from a licensed medical professional before adding strengthening

exercises for clients who have a history of chronic illness or musculoskeletal imbalances,
neuromuscular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or severe osteoarthritis.
