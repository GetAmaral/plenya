# The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise
## Chapter 9: Functional Anatomy of the Knees

CHAPTER 9
Functional Anatomy
of the Knees
The knee is the largest joint in the body (Schlossberg
and Zuidema 1997). Its primary purpose is to link
the upper leg to the lower leg with a hinge joint.
Although the knee can move in all three planes of
motion, its main functions are flexion and extension
(Hyde and Gengenbach 2007). The knee, therefore,
plays a vital role in all weight-bearing activities that
involve forward, backward, and vertical movement.

BONES AND JOINTS
The knee joint is where the tibia and fibula connect
with the femur to enable articulation between the
lower and upper leg (Dimon and Day 2008). The
kneecap is located in the center of the knee joint; it
connects to the upper leg via the quadriceps tendon
and to the lower leg via the patellar ligament. Two
discs of cartilage, the medial and lateral menisci,
provide a layer of cushioning between the bones of
the lower leg and the femur.

SOFT TISSUE STRUCTURES
Several key soft tissue structures in the knees are
discussed next so that you can understand how they
help with and influence movement. These structures
are supported in part by the muscles of the knees,
and therefore can be negatively affected by musculoskeletal imbalances.

COLLATERAL AND CRUCIATE
LIGAMENTS
There are four major ligaments in the knee joint
that connect the lower leg bones with the femur
and help stabilize movement. The medial collateral
ligament connects the tibia and femur, and the
lateral collateral ligament connects the fibula and
femur. The primary function of these ligaments is to
provide side-to-side support to the knee. Inside the
knee joint are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), which
connect the tibia and femur in a crisscross fashion.
The primary function of these ligaments is to help
stabilize the knee from front to back, side to side,
and in rotation (Hyde and Gengenbach 2007).

ILIOTIBIAL BAND
The iliotibial band (IT band) is a dense strip of connective tissue that runs along the lateral side of the
thigh (see figure 9.1). It originates from the fibers
of the gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae
muscles and serves to connect these muscles to the
lower leg (Clippinger 2007). Because of its origins
above the knee and attachment below it, the IT band
has a direct impact on knee function. Specifically,
the IT band works in conjunction with the gluteus
maximus and tensor fasciae latae to help deceler-

ate internal rotation of the leg. However, when the
gluteus maximus becomes deconditioned as a result
of musculoskeletal imbalances, it cannot do this
effectively. This results in the IT band overworking
and experiencing excessive tension and stress, often
resulting in pain.

There are many muscles in the upper and lower leg
that help stabilize and mobilize the knee. In chapter
8 you learned that some of the muscles of the lower
leg that affect the foot and ankle also affect the
knee (e.g., the soleus and the gastrocnemius). In this
chapter, you will learn about muscles in the upper
leg that originate above the knee (and attach either
to the knee or just below it) and directly affect its
function (Gray 1995). The muscles identified in this
chapter are the following:

Functional Anatomy of the Knees

Vastus Lateralis (Quadriceps Group)
Muscle specifics: A large quadriceps muscle that originates near
the top of the leg on the femur, travels down the outside of the
thigh, and inserts at the kneecap by way of the quadriceps tendon
(Kulkarni 2012).
Muscle action(s): Straightens the knee (i.e., knee extension) and
helps hold the kneecap in place (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The “bungee cord” action of the vastus
lateralis helps slow down the knee as it bends when the foot comes
in contact with the ground during closed-chain movements such as
squatting. The lengthening of this muscle as the knee bends stores
potential energy, which is then used to help the knee straighten.

Vastus
lateralis

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate force transferred through the knee during movements like
lunging or bending down in preparation for a jump. Tension created
in the muscle when the knee bends is then used to help straighten
the knee and enable the person to jump higher.
Helpful tips: As the knee bends during a squat, it creates tension
in the vastus lateralis muscle. This tension helps pull the kneecap
tight to help it track and move correctly, thereby providing protection and stability for the knee joint.

Vastus Intermedius (Quadriceps Group)

E6993/Price/TF09.01/584296/mh-R1

Muscle specifics: A large quadriceps muscle that lies beneath the
rectus femoris muscle on the front of the upper leg. It originates
on the femur near the top of the thigh, travels down the middle
of the front of the thigh, and inserts at the kneecap by way of the
quadriceps tendon (Kulkarni 2012).
Muscle action(s): Straightens the knee (knee extension) and
helps to hold the kneecap in place (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the vastus
intermedius helps decelerate flexion of the knee as it bends. The
lengthening of the muscle as the knee bends stores potential energy,
which is then used to help the knee straighten.

Vastus
intermedius

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate force transferred through the knee during movements like
squatting down to pick up a heavy weight. Tension created in the
muscle when the knee bends is used to straighten the knee to help
a person stand back upright.
Helpful tips: Performing leg extensions while seated on a machine
in the gym may not adequately prepare the quadriceps muscles for
their more functional purpose of decelerating the knee as it bends
when the foot is in contact with the ground.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Vastus Medialis (Quadriceps Group)
Muscle specifics: A large quadriceps muscle that lies toward the
midline of the body on the front of the thigh. It originates near
the top of the femur, travels down the medial side of the front of
the thigh, and inserts at the kneecap via the quadriceps tendon
(Kulkarni 2012).
Muscle action(s): Straightens the knee (knee extension) and holds
the kneecap in place (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the vastus
medialis helps decelerate flexion of the knee. The lengthening of
the muscle as the knee bends stores potential energy, which is then
used to help the knee straighten.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to slow
down the knee as it bends during movements like squatting down
to hit a low volley in tennis. Tension created in the muscle when
the knee bends is used to straighten the knee to help the person
hit the ball as they return to a standing position.

Vastus
medialis

Helpful tips: The muscle fibers of the quadriceps group come
down the front, outside, and inside of the upper leg, and they all tie
together at the quadriceps tendon, which helps hold the kneecap
in place.

Rectus Femoris (Quadriceps Group)

E6993/Price/TF09.03/584298/mh-R1

Muscle specifics: A large quadriceps muscle on the front of the
leg. It originates on the pelvis on a bony protuberance at the front
of the pelvis, travels down the front of the thigh, and inserts at the
kneecap by way of the quadriceps tendon (Kulkarni 2012).
Muscle action(s): Straightens (extends) the knee, brings the
leg toward the trunk (i.e., flexes the hip joint), and helps hold the
kneecap in place (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the rectus femoris
helps decelerate flexion of the knee. Since the rectus femoris is the
only quadriceps muscle that originates from the pelvis, it also helps
slow down extension of the hip and leg as the muscle lengthens.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate the knee as it bends in movements like lunging forward. Due
to its origin on the front of the pelvis, it also helps decelerate the
hip and leg as it extends—for example, when the leg travels behind
the body during walking or running. Tension created in the muscle
when the knee bends or the hip extends is then used to straighten
the knee or flex the hip.

Rectus
femoris

Helpful tips: The rectus femoris muscle assists the hip flexor group
of muscles in slowing down extension of the hips and legs. People
with tight hip flexors may experience problems with their rectus
femoris as it tries to overcompensate for dysfunctional hip flexors.

E6993/Price/TF09.04/584299/mh-R1


Functional Anatomy of the Knees

Gluteus Maximus
Muscle specifics: A large superficial muscle on the back of
the hips and pelvis. It originates on the back of the pelvis,
at the base of the spine (i.e., sacrum and coccyx), and on
the thoracolumbar fascia of the lower back. It runs across
the back of the hips and pelvis and has a small insertion on
the upper femur. However, the larger portion of the gluteus
maximus muscle blends into the IT band, which inserts
below the knee on the outside of the tibia (Clippinger 2007).

Gluteus
maximus

Iliotibial
band

Muscle action(s): Pushes the hips forward (i.e., extends
the hip and leg) and outwardly rotates the leg (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the gluteus maximus helps decelerate hip flexion (i.e., bending of
the hips) and internal rotation of the leg.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
decelerate hip flexion in activities such as bending your hips
to sit or squat down. Also helps to slow the internal rotation
of the leg during weight-bearing activities like walking,
lunging, and squatting when the foot pronates and the
ankle and leg rotate in to help the body to transfer weight.
Helpful tips: The gluteus maximus attaches to the
lower leg via the IT band. It is an important muscle that,
when working properly, helps to slow down pronation and
displacement of the leg toward the midline of the body.
People who overpronate and their knees move medially
will typically have weak gluteus maximus muscles and
irritated IT bands.

E6993/Price/TF09.05/584300/JB-R2

Semimembranosus (Hamstring Group)
Muscle specifics: A hamstring muscle on the back of the leg.
It originates on the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis (i.e., the
“sit bone”), travels down the back of the upper leg, crosses the
knee joint, and inserts on the medial side of the tibia (Agur and
Dalley 2013).
Muscle action(s): Bends (flexes) the knee and pushes
(extends) the hips forward. Also helps with inward rotation of
the lower leg when the knee is bent (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the semimembranosus helps decelerate the knee as it straightens and the
hips as they bend. As this muscle lengthens, tension is created,
which is then used to help extend the hips.

Semimembranosus

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
decelerate flexion of the hips during movements such as bending over to touch your toes with your legs straight. Since the
semimembranosus inserts at the tibia, it also helps control
movement of the lower leg during weight-bearing activities like
walking and running.
Helpful tips: The semimembranosus is the most medial of the
three hamstring muscles, and it helps protect the knees, hips,
and lower back from excessive stress.

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Semitendinosus (Hamstring Group)
Muscle specifics: A hamstring muscle on the back of the leg. It
originates on the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis (i.e., the “sit bone”),
travels down the back of the upper leg, crosses the knee joint, and
inserts on the medial side of the tibia a little lower down than the
semimembranosus (Agur and Dalley 2013).
Muscle action(s): Bends (flexes) the knee and pushes (extends)
the hips forward. It also helps with inward rotation of the leg when
the knee is bent (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the semitendinosus muscle helps decelerate flexion of the hips when the knee is
relatively straight. This motion helps load the muscle with potential
energy that is then used to help extend the hips when a person
stands erect.

Semitendinosus

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate flexion of the hips during movements such as bending forward
at the waist to pat a dog or tie your shoe laces. Since the semitendinosus inserts at the tibia, it also helps control the rotation of the
lower leg during weight-bearing activities like walking and running.
Helpful tips: The semitendinosus muscle works in concert with
the semimembranosus muscle to help minimize stress to the knees,
hips, and lower back.

Biceps Femoris (Hamstring Group)

E6993/Price/TF09.07/584304/mh-R1

Muscle specifics: A hamstring muscle on the back of the leg.
It has two origin points: The long head originates on the ischial
tuberosity of the pelvis (i.e., “the sit bone”), and the short head
originates lower down on the femur. The muscle travels down
the back of the upper leg, crosses the knee joint, and inserts
on the outside of the fibula and tibia (Agur and Dalley 2013).
Muscle action(s): Both the long head and the short head of
the biceps femoris are responsible for bending the knee (knee
extension), and the long head also helps extend the hips. Both
heads help with outward rotation of the leg when the knee is
bent (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the biceps
femoris helps decelerate flexion of the hips and extension of the
knee. It also helps decelerate internal rotation of the lower leg.

Short head

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
decelerate hip flexion during movements such as bending over
at the waist to touch your toes or pick a flower. It also helps
control internal rotation of the lower leg during weight-bearing
activities like walking and running.
Helpful tips: All of the hamstring muscles work in concert like
guide ropes coming up from the lower leg to help control movement of the hips, pelvis, and lower back during weight-bearing
activities.

Adductor Magnus (Adductor Group)
Muscle specifics: A large adductor muscle in the upper leg. It is divided
into two parts, an adductor portion on the inside of the thigh and a hamstring portion on the back of the leg. Both portions originate at the base
and front of the pelvis (ischium and pubis), fan diagonally across to the leg,
and insert in many areas just behind the midline of the femur nearly all the
way down to the knee (Antevil, Blackbourne, and Moore 2006).
Muscle action(s): Moves the hip and leg toward the midline of the body
(i.e., adducts the hip and leg). In addition, the hamstring portion of the
muscle pushes the hip forward (extends the hip), while the adductor
portion helps lift the leg forward (hip flexion) (Antevil, Blackbourne, and
Moore 2006).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the adductor magnus
helps decelerate abduction of the leg away from the midline of the body.
The muscle also stores potential energy as a person walks to assist with
both hip flexion and extension (depending on which part of the muscle is
emphasized during the movement).

Adductor
magnus

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate the
leg as it moves outside the pelvis (and the pelvis as it moves inside the leg)
as weight is transferred from one leg to the other, as when getting in and out
of a car. The adductor portion of the muscle also helps to slow down the leg
as it travels behind the body when walking or running, and the hamstring
portion helps slow down hip flexion during movements like bending over
to tie your shoelaces.
Helpful tips: To feel the bungee cord effect of this muscle as the hip
extends and then prepares to flex, stand in a split stance. Place your hand
on the inside of the upper thigh of the leg that is behind you. Raise that heel
off the ground and lower it again to feel the muscle shorten and lengthen.

E6993/Price/TF09.09/584306/mh-R1

Adductor Longus (Adductor Group)
Muscle specifics: An adductor muscle of the inner thigh. It originates on
the front of the pelvis near the bottom of the pubis, crosses over diagonally
to the thigh, and inserts on the inside of the femur about halfway down the
upper leg (Antevil, Blackbourne, and Moore 2006).
Muscle action(s): Pulls the leg toward the midline of the body (i.e.,
adducts the leg) and outwardly rotates the leg. It also helps to flex the hip
and leg (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the adductor longus helps
decelerate the hip and leg as they move away from the midline of the body
(i.e., abduct) during weight-bearing activities. It also helps slow down the
hip and leg as they travel into extension.
Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to decelerate
movement of the leg to the side of the body during actions like lunging to
the side; it has the same effect on movement of the trailing leg behind the
body when a person lunges forward.

Adductor
longus

Helpful tips: All the adductors work together to help the hip flexors to slow
down hip and leg extension. During hip extension, the leg also internally
rotates. The adductors also play a role in slowing down the internal rotation
of the leg when it travels behind the body into extension.

E6993/Price/TF09.10/584307/JB-R3

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

Adductor Brevis (Adductor Group)
Muscle specifics: A small adductor muscle that originates
on the front of the pelvis near the bottom of the pubis, fans
diagonally across to the leg, and inserts on the upper part of
the femur (Antevil, Blackbourne, and Moore 2006).
Muscle action(s): Brings the leg toward the midline (adduction) and flexes the hip and leg (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the adductor brevis helps decelerate movement of the hip and leg away
from the midline of the body (i.e., abduction). It also slows
down hip extension during gait when the trailing leg is on
the ground and travels behind the body.

Adductor
brevis

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to
assist with many movements of the hip and leg complex when
the pelvis has to travel over and forward of the leg, such as
what happens during activities like walking, running, and
going up stairs.
Helpful tips: The tension created in the adductor muscles
during hip extension (and the accompanying internal rotation
of the leg) creates potential energy for lifting the leg off the
ground, flexing the hip, and externally rotating the leg to help
swing it forward for the next phase of gait.

Pectineus (Adductor Group)

E6993/Price/TF09.11/584308/JB-R2

Muscle specifics: A small adductor muscle that originates on the
front of the bottom of the pelvis near the top part of the pubis,
runs across diagonally to the leg, and inserts near the top of the
femur slightly toward the back (Clippinger 2007).
Muscle action(s): Brings the hip and leg toward the midline
(adduction), outwardly rotates the leg, and assists in hip flexion.
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the pectineus
helps decelerate the hip and leg as they move away from the midline (abduct), and it slows down hip and leg extension (and the
accompanying internal rotation of the leg) during weight-bearing
activities.

Pectineus

Real-life movement example: Acts like a bungee cord to slow
down the hip and leg complex as it moves away from the midline
and behind the body when the leg is in contact with the ground
during weight-bearing activities such as walking, lunging, or
working out on an elliptical machine.
Helpful tips: Exercise equipment such as the Thigh Master and
similar machines primarily work the adductors in a concentric
manner. However, to develop strong and healthy muscles that
function well, the adductors must be strengthened using exercises
that lengthen the muscle, such as what happens when lunging or
stepping from side to side.

E6993/Price/TF09.12/584309/mh-R1


Functional Anatomy of the Knees

Gracilis (Adductor Group)
Muscle specifics: A long adductor muscle that originates
on the front of the bottom of the pelvis on the medial part
of the pubis, runs on an angle all the way down the inside
of the upper leg, and inserts on the medial side of the tibia
just below the knee (Antevil, Blackbourne, and Moore 2006).
Muscle action(s): Adducts, flexes, and externally rotates
the hip and leg. Due to its attachment just below the knee,
it also helps flex the knee (Gray 1995).
Real-life movements: The bungee cord action of the gracilis helps decelerate the hip and leg as they move away from
the midline (hip and leg abduction); it also helps decelerate
internal rotation of the leg and extension of the hip and leg.
Since it attaches to the lower leg, it also helps stabilize the
knee as the leg moves into extension.

Gracilis

Real-life movement example: While similar to the other
adductor muscles, the gracilis is distinct in that it crosses
the knee joint and attaches to the tibia. Consequently, the
gracilis provides stability to the knee during activities where
the trailing leg moves into extension, such as climbing a
ladder or steep hill or when ice skating.
Helpful tips: All the adductor muscles work together to help
stabilize the pelvis on top of the legs during weight-bearing
activities.

EFFECT OF KNEE MUSCLES
ON THE MOST COMMON
MUSCULOSKELETAL
DEVIATIONS
The muscles described in this section play a vital
role in mitigating the two most common deviations
of the knee: side-to-side alignment problems and
tracking problems during flexion and extension.
They directly strengthen and support the knee
and decelerate forces on the knee by controlling
the body’s weight as it is transferred over the feet,
ankles, legs, and pelvis (Price and Bratcher 2010).
When considering the real-life functions of the
muscles that surround the knees, it may be helpful
to visualize these soft tissue structures as strings of
a puppet that hang down from the pelvis and upper
leg, attaching to various parts of the upper leg, knee,
and lower leg. The positioning of these “strings” and
their appropriate movement control the bones that
affect the knee (the femur, kneecap, tibia, and fibula)
and stabilize, decelerate, and accelerate the knee in
all planes of motion.

E6993/Price/TF09.13/584310/mh-R1

Here are three examples of how the bungee cord
feature of specific muscles and muscle groups can
prevent the two most common deviations of the knee.

EXAMPLE ONE: GLUTEUS
MAXIMUS AND THE
ADDUCTORS
The gluteus maximus and the adductor group of
muscles both help prevent side-to-side displacement
of the knee (as well as overpronation of the foot and
ankle complex).
When a person is walking, part of the gait cycle
involves the leg swinging forward and the foot striking the ground. When this happens, the insertion
point of the gluteus maximus on the leg is pulled
away from its origins on the back of the pelvis and
the base of the spine. As the gait cycle continues
and pressure is transferred into the foot, the leg
rotates inward, pulling the insertion point of the
gluteus maximus even farther from its origin points.
This motion creates tension in this muscle (and in
the iliotibial band) that slows the internal rotation
of the leg and the movement of the knee toward

87


88

The BioMechanics Method for Corrective Exercise

the midline of the body and prevents a valgus knee
position, tracking problems, and overpronation at
the foot and ankle (see figure 9.2).
As the gait cycle continues, the knee and leg
straighten as the leg travels behind the body into
extension. As the leg travels behind the pelvis, the
heel remains in contact with the ground, the foot
pronates, and the leg rotates inwardly. The adductor
muscles, which attach mostly to the medial sides of
the upper and lower leg bones, lengthen and decelerate hip extension and internal rotation of the leg. As
they lengthen, they also slow the pelvis as it shifts
inside the leg and toward the midline during weight
transfer. Effective lengthening of the adductors,
therefore, is vital to minimizing stress on the pelvis,
hips, knees, feet, and ankles (see figure 9.3).

Figure 9.2

EXAMPLE TWO: THE
QUADRICEPS
The quadriceps play an important part in preventing tracking problems of the knee. The quadriceps
muscles attach to the kneecap via the quadriceps
tendon. As the knee bends, the quadriceps lengthen,
creating tension in these muscles, the quadriceps
tendon, and the patellar ligament, which helps to
pull the kneecap tight to the knee so it can track
correctly over the femoral groove (at the bottom of
the femur) (see figure 9.4). As the knee straightens,
the pressure on the kneecap is reduced, enabling the
knee to straighten.

Functional Anatomy of the Knees

EXAMPLE THREE: THE
HAMSTRINGS
The hamstrings help prevent side-to-side alignment
problems of the knee. These muscles run like guide
ropes from the base of the pelvis, down the back
of the leg, and attach to either side of the lower
leg. When the hip is flexed and the leg is relatively
straight (such as what happens when bending over
to touch one’s toes), the hamstrings lengthen under
tension to control side-to-side movement of the knee

a

and prevent valgus or varus imbalances (see figure
9.5). They also work in a bottom-up fashion (from
insertion point to origin) by lengthening to control
the pelvis as the base of it rotates away from the
knee (i.e., an anterior pelvic tilt).
When all the muscles that cross the knees are
working correctly, then the bones that meet at the
knee joint can move in a controlled manner, and
deviations or movement imbalances in the knees
can be reduced.

Review of Key Points
The knee joint is controlled and affected by muscles in the lower and upper leg. The muscles
that cross the knee both produce movement and slow down movement to protect the knee
joint and its soft tissue structures from unnecessary stress.
■■Although the knee joint is a hinge joint, it has the capability to move in all three planes

of motion.
■■The quadriceps group consists of four muscles on the front of the upper leg that lengthen

under tension to slow down forces on the knee as it bends. As they lengthen, they also
help pull the kneecap tight on the femoral groove so that it tracks correctly.
■■The gluteus maximus has attachments on the femur and the tibia, which enables it to

slow down hip flexion and internal rotation of the upper and lower leg. A weak gluteus
maximus is less able to prevent excessive inward rotation of the leg and overpronation of
the foot. Therefore, the gluteus maximus is an important muscle to target in a corrective
exercise program to address these common imbalances.
■■The position and attachment sites of the hamstring muscles enable them to help con-

trol movement of the torso as a person bends forward and to slow down the knee as it
straightens and moves from side to side during the gait cycle.
■■Unlike most of the other muscles in the upper leg, which generally run parallel to the

femur, the adductor group runs diagonally from the pelvis to the femur. Their prime job
is to help stabilize the pelvis as it moves from side to side and to decelerate the leg as it
internally rotates and extends.
■■The only adductor muscle that does not attach to the femur is the gracilis. It attaches to

the medial side of the top of the tibia, which means it has a direct impact on knee function.

Self-Check
There are many distinct groups of muscles in the upper leg that cross the knee joint and
affect knee function. For the actions that follow, try to describe what each muscle or muscle
group is doing during that movement to help minimize unnecessary stress on the knee or
to enable the movement to happen correctly. An example is provided.

MOVEMENT: Getting out of a car
Gluteus maximus: Stabilizes the knee and helps extend the hips to help you stand
up out of the seat.
Quadriceps: Ensure that the knee tracks correctly and help extend the knees to stand.
Adductors: Stabilize the pelvis over the leg that is still inside the car as you begin to
stand and lift the other leg in preparation for stepping out of the car.
Hamstrings: Slow down hip flexion so you do not lean too far forward when you try
to stand up.
