rculation when shunting is present on the level of capillaries, impaired oxygen utilization can lead to 
normal or supraphysiological ScvO2 values, which represent an inability of the cells to extract oxygen in sepsis (21). In patients with ScvO2>70% complementary blood gas parameters, such as elevated venous-to-arterial CO2 gap (dCO2) (>6mmHg), increased or persistently elevated serum lactate levels could 
help the clinicians to identify tissue hypoxia. In a retrospective analysis, septic patients with physiological ScvO2 and abnormal dCO2 mortality was signicantly higher as compared to patients with normal dCO2 values (22).In patients treated on intensive care units, heart failure is oen present resulting impaired CO, hence decreased oxygen delivery 
(23), and resulting oxygen extraction imbalance that could be 
detected by low ScvO2 (24).

vO2. Although the absolute values of ScvO2 are 5% higher than SvO2 on average, but changes usually occur in a parallel manner (15), therefore ScvO2 is regarded as a surrogate marker in the clinical setting (16, 17).e main factors, which inuence ScvO2, are hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, CO, and oxygen con-
sumption. ere are multiple physiologic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic factors that inuence venous oxygen saturation such 
as anemia, hypovolemia, contractility, bleeding, sedation, fever, and pain (18).ScvO2 in Intensive Care PatientsDuring sepsis, organ dysfunction is most likely the result of inad-equate tissue perfusion causing cellular hypoxia. Interventions improving the balance between DO2 and VO2 may prevent the development of tissue hypoperfusion, organ dysfunction 
syndrome, and thus improve the outcome of septic patients.

directed intervention guided by continuous monitoring of ScvO2, central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP), with target values of CVP 8 to 12mmHg, MAP>65mmHg and ScvO2>70%, reduced mortality from 46.5 to 30.5% at the 28th day (19).Although this study has been criticized for several reasons and these results could never be repeated, there is international 
consensus that that low ScvO2 values are very important warning signs of inadequate DO2 and can prognosticate complications and poor outcome. However, recent data suggest that high ScvO2 values may also have adverse outcomes in septic patients (20).

ONInterventions to improve oxygen delivery and decrease oxygen consumption are the cornerstone of resuscitation in the critically ill patients and during the perioperative period of high-risk patients. 
Early recognition of the patients at risks and the implementation of adequate monitoring-guided 
interventions can have a profound eect on outcome. On the contrary, delaying adequate interven-
tions will inevitably lead to hypoperfusion, tissue hypoxia, and multiple-organ failure aecting 
both outcome and wasting of resources and costs (1).

e to monitor the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. For 
this purpose, central venous blood gas analysis provides an easily available tool in 
the everyday clinical practice. The adequate interpretation of central venous oxygen 
saturation renders the need of careful evaluation of several physiological and patho-
physiological circumstances. When appropriately evaluated, central venous oxygen 
saturation can be a valuable component of a multimodal individualized approach, in 
which components of oxygen delivery are put in the context of the patients’ individual 
oxygen consumption.

traoperative hemodynamic optimization (CeVOX Maquet® Munich Germany) during major abdominal surgery. In the con-
ventional group, patients were treated according to mean arterial and central venous pressure, while in the ScvO2 group, addition-ally venous oxygen saturation was also measured via beroptic catheter placed in the superior vena cava. ScvO2 monitorization resulted in more interventions, more uid boluses and more blood transfusion compared to the conventional group. ese interven-tion resulted in better organ functions, less complication rate, 
and better 28days of survival (35). ese results are in accord with the results of an earlier single-center study, where ScvO2 over 73% directed group had fewer postoperative complications and had shorter length of hospital stay compared to patients in whom hemodynamic stabilization was guided according to MAP 
and central venous pressure (36).

stoperative complications in patients with physiological (71%) ScvO2 (50). In critically ill patients, the dCO2 shows good inverse correlation with the CO (42), and it has also been shown to be a good predictor for bad outcome in 
patients with septic shock (41). In cases like septic shock, when due to microcirculatory or mitochondrial defects oxygen uptake 
is insucient, ScvO2 can be supranormal. Previous studies have suggested that under such circumstances the increased value of dCO2 (>5mmHg) and increased lactate level can help the physician in detecting inadequate ow to the tissues; hence, the 
complementary use of ScvO2 and dCO2 is recommended (50, 51).CONCLUSIONEarly and adequate interventions to improve hemodynamics, oxy-gen delivery, and reducing oxygen needs have a signicant eect on outcome.

an Everyday Clinical Challenge Zsolt Molnar* and Marton NemethDepartment of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, University of Szeged, Szeged, HungaryPurpose of review: The aim of this article is to study the overview of pathophysiology and clinical application of central venous oxygen saturation monitoring in critically ill 
patients and during the perioperative period.Recent ndings: There are several clinical studies and animal experiments evalu-ating the effects of goal-directed hemodynamic stabilization on critically ill patients. 
Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses found that advanced hemodynamic 
endpoints-targeted management has a positive effect on outcome in high-risk sur-gical patients. As all interventions aim to improve tissue oxygenation, it is of utmost 
importance to monitor the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption. For 
this purpose, central venous blood gas analysis provides an easily available tool in 
the everyday clinical practice.

 e main dierence between the equations of DO2 and VO2 is the oxygen content (CaO2 versus CcvO2), especially the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). erefore, it can be useful to assess the imbalance between DO2 and VO2 in the critically ill.When the arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and/or CO becomes impaired, DO2 decreases, which is oen accompanied by a paral-lel decrease in VO2. e most frequently occurring scenarios are represented in Figure1. In the early phase of decreasing DO2, the circulation can compensate to some extent, and VO2 remains stable. However, beyond a critical point, any further drop 
in DO2 will result in a decrease in VO2.

tissue perfusion, but for ne tuning of therapy detailed hemodynamic monitoring is warranted 
(3). e recent FENICE (Fluid Challenges In Intensive Care) trial indicate that there is a consid-erable gap between the accumulating knowledge about the benets of advanced hemodynamic

objective data about oxygen debt of organs, ScvO2 may oer an easily obtainable tool to detect a low hemoglobin-related altered O2ER and hence may serve as a physiological trigger for blood transfusion (30). In human studies, both on volunteers and ret-
rospective data in critically ill patients suggest that lower levels of hemoglobin compared to that of recommended by international 
guidelines were well tolerated and did not produce hemody-namic instability, and when oxygen imbalance occurred, it was accompanied by a signicant drop in SvO2 (3032).

and morbidity compared to patients with low-risk interventions (38). ScvO2 is an important element of this complex periopera-tive multimodal monitoring-based concept, including advanced 
hemodynamic monitoring and assessment of VO2/DO2, what we call the individualized, multimodal approach (39).COMPLEMENTARY BLOOD GAS PARAMETERSVenous-to-Arterial CO2 Gap (dCO2)Mixed-, or central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide gap is an easily attainable parameter when patients has arterial and central venous lines insitu. e physiological value is 6mmHg, and this holds true for both mixed- (Pv-aCO2) and central venous-to-arterial (Pcv-aCO2) CO2 gap values.

c heart failure, ScvO2 can be chronically low. However, during acute decompensation, major cardiac events 
were observed in 81% of patients with ScvO260% at 24h aer ICU admission, while it was only 13% in patients with higher 
ScvO2 (27).ScvO2 and Blood TransfusionIn addition to heart failure, anemia is another frequent cause of impaired DO2 in critically ill patients, and almost 4045% of patients will receive blood transfusion during the treatment period (28). As large multicenter trials (TRICC and TRISS) sug-gest that patients with hemoglobin levels above 10mg/dl usually 
do not require transfusion, while red blood cell administration is usually benecial if the hemoglobin level is below 7mg/dl (29, 30). Between these values, physicians have to make decisions according to clinical signs like mental status, tachycardia, tachyp-nea, blood pressure, and diuresis.

For this purpose, additional physiological parameters like 
central venous oxygen saturation, lactate, and venous-to-arterial 
CO2 gap should be assessed together with other hemodynamic variables to get a detailed picture about the hemodynamic status of our patients. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together in context is what we dene as multimodal, individualized hemodynamic 
support, in which ScvO2 has a pivotal role.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual

rela-tion with changes of ScvO2 (33); hence, ScvO2 may be used as a physiologic transfusion trigger in otherwise hemodynamically 
stable patients.ScvO2 and High-Risk SurgeryHigh-risk surgical patients are at an increased risk of developing imbalance between VO2 and DO2 in the perioperative period; therefore, monitoring ScvO2 may have a rationale during both the intraoperative and postoperative managements.It has been shown that patients with low ScvO2 values preop-eratively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively are at an increased risk for complications and poor prognosis (34). erefore, it seems to be logical to maintain ScvO2 in normal range during the perio-perative care. We reported in a small, single-center prospective randomized study about continuously measured ScvO2-assisted intraoperative hemodynamic optimization (CeVOX Maquet® Munich Germany) during major abdominal surgery.

inverse relationship between the CO and dCO2 (45); in other words, increased levels of dCO2 should reect low-ow states. Indeed, it has been shown that in sepsis, heart failure, and severe hypov-
olemia, its value can be elevated (46, 47).In the perioperative setting, dCO2 also has a strong predictive value. Patients with high dCO2 had signicantly higher mortal-ity compared to patients with normal values (36.4 versus 4.5%) 
(48). High-risk surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit postoperatively with high dCO2 also developed more complica-tions. e cuto value was 5.8mmHg (49), and in a dierent

monitoring based optimization and the actual clinical practice. In more than 2,000 patients, uid challenges were evaluated. e main indicator of administering uid boluses was hypotension in 57%, and in 43% of cases, no hemodynamic variable was used 
to predict uid responsiveness (4). Detailed assessment of global hemodynamic indices such as cardiac output (CO) and derived 
variables and also the measures of oxygen delivery and uptake should be taken into account to provide appropriate therapy for these patients (5, 6). Furthermore, in addition to the optimiza-tion of global hemodynamic parameters, indicators of tissue perfusion should also be monitored to verify the eectiveness of our interventions (7).
