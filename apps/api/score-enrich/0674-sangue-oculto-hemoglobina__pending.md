s in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease. e Cobas 6500 urine analyzer may also give some false positive results for RBCs in patients with bladder cancer because 3 or more RBCs/HPF despite a negative result in the dipstick test was more frequent in patients with bladder cancer than in those with glomerular disease.In urologic malignancies, hematuria is intermittent, and the level of microscopic hematuria does not indicate the seriousness of the  disease30, and it is important to determine the presence or absence of hematuria. If adults older than 40years test positive for hematuria, a urologic investigation is required to exclude malignancy. Because the dipstick test detects heme from hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and glomerular hematuria as well as extra-glomerular hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.

ability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36. However, bacterial peroxidase does not seem to account for the lower numbers of urinary RBCs in glomerular disease because urinary tract infection was not documented in the patients with glomerular disease during the study period. In contrast, ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid-containing so drinks may cause false-negative  results37; however, the patients included in this study were not questioned about this before obtaining urinalysis specimens.In conclusion, our data suggest that urine RBC counting by the UF-1000i urine analyzer or the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs are susceptible to hemolysis and/or are not properly recognized.Received: 8 July 2021; Accepted: 7 October 2021

Among the urine samples with a negative result in the dipstick test, the frequency of 3 or more RBCs/HPF was similar between bladder cancer (1.4%) and glomerular disease (1.8%) in the data obtained via the UF-1000i urine analyzer, but it was higher in bladder cancer (8.7%, p < 0.001) than in glomerular disease (1.9%) in the data obtained via the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer.Discussione urine dipstick test is very sensitive for the detection of hematuria (sensitivity 91100%), but it may not be specic (specicity 6599%) because it also yields positive results for hemoglobinuria or  myoglobinuria25.

100 RBCs/HPF).e presence of blood and the pH of the urine were measured via a dipstick test. e urine color and the dipstick test results were read via an automatic reader. e Urisys 2400 automated urine test strip analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was used to read the dipstick tests of the urine specimens examined using the UF-1000i urine analyzer, whereas the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer was used to conduct the urine dipstick test as well as the urine RBC counting using two modules, the Cobas u 601 for the urine dipstick and the Cobas u 701 for urine microscopy. Test strips in the Urisys 2400 cassettes and the cobas u packs were used with the Urisys 2400 analyzer and the Cobas u 601 analyzer, respectively. In both analyzers, dipstick hematuria was graded as −, ±, 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+.

ion) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable. In the urine specimens with specific gravity ≥ 1.010, RBC counts measured using either UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 were well correlated with the positive grades in the dipstick blood test. However, at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, RBC counts were graded significantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer. The findings suggest that RBC counting by UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs in glomerular disease are susceptible to hemolysis and/or fail to be properly recognized.Hematuria can occur in glomerular diseases as well as extraglomerular diseases, including urologic malignan-cies. It is detected in the urinalysis by either a dipstick test or microscopic examination of urine sediment.

r hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy. us, hematuria is dened as ≥ 3 RBCs/HPF and this is the widely accepted denition across uro-logic  societies3,4; furthermore, the dipstick hematuria test is not considered sucient to mandate an evaluation.In glomerular disease, however, the amount of hematuria may be more important than the presence or absence of hematuria because high-grade hematuria suggests a nephritic glomerular disease  in the dierential diagnosis and may also indicate a worse renal prognosis.In a recent  study31, urine dipstick hematuria was shown to be useful in dierentiating proliferative glomeru-lonephritis from other causes of kidney diseases, with higher positive grades in the dipstick blood test associated with higher positive predictive values.e association of hematuria with adverse renal outcomes has also been reported in glomerular diseases.

**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.639

Comprehensive review on differentiating hemoglobinuria from hematuria. Hematuria shows dipstick positive with proportionate RBCs on microscopic urinalysis, while hemoglobinuria shows dipstick positive with disproportionately low or absent RBCs. When centrifuged, the sediment is red in hematuria versus red supernatant in hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, or drug-induced discoloration. Hemoglobinuria is easily confused with other causes of discolored urine, potentially resulting in extensive unnecessary urological workup. Case demonstrates importance of proper diagnostic differentiation.

have more advantages for the follow-up of hematuria in cases of glomerular disease, as the results can be positive due to dysmorphic RBCs as well as isomorphic RBCs; further, hematuria can be detected in dilute urine specimens by the presence of heme released from lysed  RBCs27.is study has some limitations. First, automated urinary sediment examination was not compared with the manual microscopic examination, which is recommended in the evaluation of urine sediments in patients with glomerular disease. e latter, however, should be performed by experts under standard conditions and is not feasible where a large number of samples need to be processed quickly. Furthermore, RBC counting under the manual microscopic examination is also not accurate and is subject to wide interobserver  variability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36.

Automated urine sediment analyzers underestimate the severity of hematuria in glomerular diseasesWon Seok YangHematuria, either glomerular or extraglomerular, is defined as 3 or more red blood cells (RBCs)/high power field. Currently, urinalyses are commonly performed using automated urine sediment analyzers. To assess whether RBC counting by automated urine sediment analyzers is reliable for defining hematuria in glomerular disease, random specimen urinalyses of men with nephritic glomerular disease (7674 urinalyses) and bladder cancer (12,510 urinalyses) were retrospectively reviewed. Urine RBCs were counted by an automated urine sediment analyzer based on flow cytometry (UF-1000i, Sysmex Corporation) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable.

Comprehensive clinical guidelines for hematuria evaluation. Microhematuria is defined as 3 or more urinary RBCs per high-power field requiring microscopic confirmation. Risk stratification includes low-risk (<1% cancer risk), intermediate-risk (0.2-3.1% risk), and high-risk (1.3-6.3% risk) categories based on age, smoking history, and RBC count. Differential diagnosis distinguishes glomerular causes (proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, casts) from nonglomerular causes (urological pathology). Cystoscopy remains 98% sensitive for bladder cancer detection and is underutilized.

minations were car-ried out using the UF-1000i urine analyzer (Sysmex Corporation). ereaer, the instrument for urinalysis was changed to the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). For the analysis of the UF-1000i urine analyzer data, the urinalyses of the patients with glomerular disease performed between January 2011 and Octo-ber 2016 and the urinalyses of the patients with bladder cancer performed between January 2013 and December 2015 were collected. For the analysis of the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer data, the urinalyses of the patients with glomerular disease performed between December 2016 and December 2020 and the urinalyses of the patients with bladder cancer performed between January 2017 and December 2019 were collected.For the patients with glomerular disease, some urinalyses were conducted the day aer the kidney biopsy, which may have caused extraglomerular hematuria. us, only urinalyses from outpatients, and not inpatients, were included.

tudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Asan Medical Center (IRB No. S2021-0242-0001); the requirement of obtaining informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective study design. All methods were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Laboratory parameters. Urine specimens were randomly obtained at the outpatient clinic and trans-ported to the clinical laboratory without preservatives. e laboratory aimed to report the urinalysis results within 1h of sampling.Urinary RBCs counted via either the UF-1000i urine analyzer or the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer were reported as follows: grade 1 (02 RBCs/HPF), grade 2 (35 RBCs/HPF), grade 3 (610 RBCs/HPF), grade 4 (1120 RBCs/HPF), grade 5 (2130 RBCs/HPF), grade 6 (31100 RBCs/HPF) and grade 7 (> 100 RBCs/HPF).e presence of blood and the pH of the urine were measured via a dipstick test. e urine color and the dipstick test results were read via an automatic reader.

nalyzers identify RBCs by ow cytometry (for example, UF-1000i urine analyzer, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) or analysis of digitalized images of the urine sediment (for example, Cobas 6500 urine analyzer, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)7,8. e analyzers have good performance for the identication of isomorphic RBCs as in extraglomerular  hematuria9.In glomerular disease, the presence of hematuria is a key factor in dierentiating nephritic disease from nephrotic disease. Recently, more attention has been paid to hematuria in glomerular disease because hematuria was shown to have a negative prognostic  impact10.Glomerular hematuria is dierent from extraglomerular hematuria in terms of the RBC morphology. RBCs from extraglomerular hematuria have an isomorphic appearance as seen in peripheral blood smears, whereas RBCs of glomerular origin are small and have a dysmorphic appearance with marked variability in size and  shape11.

Comprehensive clinical review of proteinuria covering definition, etiology, diagnosis, and management. Proteinuria serves as a marker of kidney damage assisting with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Normal protein excretion is <150 mg/24 hours. Severity categories: nephritic range (150-3,500 mg/24h) and nephrotic range (>3,500 mg/24h). Urine dipstick provides semi-quantitative screening but has important limitations: false-positives with dehydration, alkaline urine, UTI; inability to detect positively charged proteins. UK CKD guidelines define significant proteinuria as UPCR >45 mg/mmol. Quantitative methods (spot UPCR preferred for convenience and reliability, or 24-hour urine collection for accuracy) are indicated when dipstick is positive or proteinuria >1 g/day is suspected. Early detection and quantification are crucial given associations with progressive renal disease and cardiovascular complications.

luded, however, there were urinalyses with a positive dipstick testfor blood but negative or relatively few RBCs, suggesting that some RBCs are degraded before urinalysis or are not detected. Such urinalyses were more frequent in cases of glomerular disease than in cases of bladder cancer, and at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, the RBC counts were signicantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer.In glomerular hematuria, RBCs pass through the glomerular ltration barrier and the convoluted tubules, which may distort the RBC morphology. RBCs may undergo lysis during this passage, or the morphologically altered RBCs can be more vulnerable to  hemolysis26. If RBCs are degraded, they are not detected by microscopic examination, but the hemoglobin released from the RBCs is still detected by the dipstick  test27.
