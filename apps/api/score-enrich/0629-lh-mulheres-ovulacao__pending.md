rious forms of LH.Our results show that an OPK detecting total or non-intact U-LH-ir will be strongly positive for up to 3days after the 
peak for intact U-LH-ir, which is positive for only a single day 
during the LH surge. Therefore, the likelihood of detecting 
the fertility window within and beyond the LH surge period 
should be greater if an OPK detecting total U-LH-ir rather 
than intact LH is used. The best alternative may be to use 
an OPK detecting both intact and non-intact U-LH-ir sepa-
rately, the latter preferably in the form of LHcf. An OPK that 
detects total and intact LH-ir can function as a compromise 
solution by calculating the non-intact LH-ir as the arithmetic 
diﬀerence.

nduces ovulation within 23days. The surge can be detected 
by the observation of LH in serum or in urine with ovula-
tion predictor kits (OPKs). If a woman knows the duration 
of her menstrual cycle, she can plan the timing of testing. 
The average length of the menstrual cycle is 28days, but 
a regular cycle lasting anywhere between 24 and 38days 
is considered normal [4; 5; 6]. The cycle length is deter-mined by follicular growth and by the lifespan of the corpus 
luteum [7]. Many women experience varying cycle lengths with back and forth shifts in the day of ovulation, which may 
pose a problem especially for infertility patients. To detect 
ovulation, patients are at present required to determine LH 
levels in urine with an OPK daily until getting a positive 
result, which causes undue stress in addition to the ﬁnancial 
burden [8; 9].OPKs may miss the LH surge for various reasons, one being an unusually short cycle.

ateau-type LH peak during several days after the LH 
surge (as in Figs.1 and 2) [33]. However, our results illus-trate that if LH is measured by a method that detects only 
intact LH, the peak concentrations of LH in urine and serum 
occur at the same time (Fig.1). If a method for total LH is used, the peak in urine may be biphasic or broad. A double 
peak of intact LH was not seen in serum, nor was it seen in 
non-intact LH. This suggests that non-intact LH is formed 
in the kidneys and excreted into urine for several days after 
the LH surge.Knowledge regarding the period of high fertility prior to ovulation, which was previously believed to cover the 5days 
prior to ovulation plus the day of ovulation [10; 11; 34; 35; 
36], has been updated.

pproxi-
mately 12days (oocyte lifespan) after ovulation [18]. Onset 
of the LH surge precedes ovulation by 3544h, and the peak 
level of serum LH (S-LH) precedes ovulation by 1012h 
[19; 20]. Pregnancy rates are highest from 2days before 
ovulation to the day of ovulation [9].We have recently described methods for separation and determination of three molecular forms of LH immunoreac-
tivity (LH-ir), namely, intact LH, its free beta-subunit (LH), 
and LHcf. The latter two together form the non-intact por-tion of the LH-ir. The three forms can be separated by gel 
ﬁltration of urine obtained from regularly menstruating 
women, LHcf being the dominant form among degrada-
tion products of LH subsequent to the LH surge [21].In the current study, we have examined whether speciﬁc detection of the various forms of LH in urine can improve 
detection of the LH surge.

actors [11].Better timing of intercourse can improve the probabil-ity of achieving pregnancy, and a majority of commercially 
available OPKs reliably detect the LH surge, which heralds 
imminent ovulation [12]. Because a positive urine test for the LH surge precedes ovulation by 12days, it is possible 
to use OPKs for planning timed intercourse and intrauterine 
insemination. Randomized controlled trials show that the 
use of OPKs may increase pregnancy rates [13]. Thus, OPKs 
are regarded as the best method to predict ovulation [14]. 
Use of OPKs that also detect estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G) 
facilitates prediction of the onset of the fertile period before 
the LH surge [15; 16; 17].The fertility window begins approximately 35days (sperm lifespan) before ovulation and continues for approxi-
mately 12days (oocyte lifespan) after ovulation [18].

Study of 668 natural cycle FET examining precise hormonal changes during the LH surge. Findings showed that successful ovulation involves simultaneous LH increase (>180% baseline), estradiol decrease, and progesterone rise (threefold increase). Patients who conceived showed significantly higher progesterone increases. The research emphasizes the importance of monitoring multiple hormones, including FSH context, for optimal fertility timing and embryo transfer success (52-56.8% pregnancy rates).

a preovulatory period of up to 4 to 7days and continues with 
a postovulatory period of up to 2days, which has been estab-
lished through relatively more recent ﬁndings, as outlined in a 
publication by Wilcox etal. [37]. Indeed, an additional 1day 
on average on top of the day of ovulation should be taken into 
consideration to allow for the lifespans of sperm and ovum 
(1.4days and 0.7days on average, respectively) in computing 
the range of the fertility window [18; 38; 39]. Based on these 
facts, it is justiﬁed to suggest incorporating separate detection 
of intact and non-intact U-LH-ir, the latter preferably in the 
form of LHcf, in order to improve the performance of cur-rent OPKs.

In our earlier study, we separated three diﬀerent molecular forms of urinary LH-ir (U-LH-ir) by gel ﬁltration and identiﬁed them by immunoassay in urine from regularly menstruating women on periovulatory days. U-LH-ir is composed 
of intact luteinizing hormone (LH), its free beta-subunit (LH), and the core fragment of LH (LHcf), the latter two estab-
lishing the non-intact portion of LH-ir. The aim was to determine whether timing of ovulation can be improved by detecting 
diﬀerent molecular forms of U-LH-ir in women of reproductive age.

7.Conclusions
 
Total and non-intact LH-ir are potential add-on characteristics which can be utilized in ovulation predictor kits to measure LH-ir in urine beyond the LH surge during a broader time frame, thereby paving the way for more precise 
prediction of the timing of ovulation than that obtained with currently available products.Keywords

on of LH through the kidney tubules. In the light of earlier studies, degrada-
tion products of LH do not occur at detectable levels in 
serum [1; 2; 21]. Overall, these data prove that the fertil-
ity window obtained by measuring intact (or total) LH in 
serum is narrower than that observed by measuring non-
intact (or total) LH in urine.The concentrations of intact U-LH were higher than those of non-intact U-LH before and on the day of the LH surge; 
however, immediately after the LH surge, intact U-LH-ir 
levels decreased rapidly, while non-intact LH-ir remained 
high. As a result, the concentration of non-intact LH-ir in 
urine remained much higher than that of intact LH-ir (over 
ﬁvefold) for the ﬁrst 3days after the LH surge, moderately 
elevated (over threefold) thereafter until day

etermine whether timing of ovulation can be improved by detecting 
diﬀerent molecular forms of U-LH-ir in women of reproductive age.
Methods
 
We determined intact and total U-LH-ir in 14 regularly menstruating women on consecutive periovulatory days during the menstrual cycle. Non-intact LH-ir was calculated as the arithmetic diﬀerence between total and intact LH-ir. In 
addition, LH-ir was determined in both serum and urine from four of the women throughout the menstrual cycle.
Results
 
During the LH surge, U-LH-ir consisted mainly of intact LH and presented with an abrupt increase. Intact U-LH-ir dropped rapidly within 1day after the surge, reaching baseline levels at the end of the luteal phase. In contrast, LHcf in 
urine increased further 1day after the surge.

c detection of the various forms of LH in urine can improve 
detection of the LH surge. We measured the concentrations 
of the various forms of LH in daily urine and serum sam-
ples throughout the menstrual cycle by employing assays 
that separately detect intact and total LH immunoreactivity 
(LH-ir). Currently, it is not possible to determine LH con-
centrations speciﬁcally for LH-beta (LH) or its core frag-
ment (LHcf) by any commercially available assay. Thus, 
we employed two diﬀerent immunoﬂuorometric LH assays, 
one that measured only intact LH and the other capable of 
detecting total LH, i.e., intact LH, LH, and LHcf. LH-ir 
originating from wild-type and variant LH molecules was 
detectable by both assays [22; 23; 24].Materials andmethodsSamples andstorage conditionsThe study was performed at the Department of Clinical 
Chemistry, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.

7. This is in line with the ﬁndings of our earlier study in which non-intact LH-ir formed about 
90% of LH immunoreactivity in urine 25days after the 
LH surge [21].The current study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate the broader extent of urinary excretion of non-intact LH, hence of 
LHcf, after the LH surge in 14 menstruating women by 
commercially available assays (Figs.1, 2, 3), conﬁrming the earlier preliminary ﬁndings reported by us and OConnor 
etal. [21; 28]. Signiﬁcant increases in non-intact to intact 
LH ratio above 3 on day

1 and above 5 on day

2 point to an intensiﬁed expression of LHcf immunoreactivity 
in urine during the highest probable window of ovulation, 
which current OPKs fail to detect to this extent. If the fer-tility window is deﬁned on the basis of total or non-intact 
LH-ir in urine, it is broader than that detected by intact LH.
