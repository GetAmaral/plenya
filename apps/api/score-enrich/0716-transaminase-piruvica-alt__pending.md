scores.75,76 A raised AST/ALT ratio of only slightly above 1 (1.09) is predictive of the progression of chronic viral hepatitis 
C to cirrhosis.77It is therefore the elevation of AST, rather than ALT, which 
is predictive of fibrosis and other ratios involving AST, such 
as the AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI)78 and FIB4 index (which involves the four parameters: AST, ALT, platelets and 
age) are also more predictive.79,80 The reason why the AST is more elevated than ALT with progression of fibrosis is 
uncertain but may be either because of increased production, 
such as mitochondrial release,81,82 or a relatively reduced clearance.83Chronic viral hepatitis may also progress to hepatocellular 
carcinoma, however GGT is the best predictor of this 
complication, while AST is not predictive in multivariate 
analysis and ALT is not predictive at all.84 Alcoholic Hepatitis

Esta investigação examinou padrões de GGT em quatro condições hepáticas distintas para esclarecer seu significado diagnóstico além da avaliação de gravidade. A pesquisa envolveu 408 pacientes com cirrose biliar primária (CBP), lesão hepática induzida por drogas (DILI), doença hepática alcoólica (DHA) e doença hepática gordurosa não alcoólica (DHGNA). Achados revelaram diferenças marcantes em padrões de elevação da GGT. Em CBP e DILI, anormalidades da GGT ocorreram em aproximadamente 93-96% dos casos, correlacionando fortemente com marcadores de colestase como fosfatase alcalina. DHA demonstrou GGT elevada em 78% dos pacientes, refletindo tanto estresse oxidativo quanto colestase. DHGNA mostrou menor taxa de anormalidade (54%), com níveis máximos atingindo apenas 200 U/L comparados a mais de 2000 U/L na DHA. GGT correlacionou-se distintamente com diferentes biomarcadores em cada doença: conexões mais fortes com fosfatase alcalina e colesterol total em condições colestáticas, versus associações com triglicerídeos em distúrbios metabólicos.

evident hepatomegaly occurs in up to 75% of patients with NAFLD and is even greater (85%) when 
assessed by ultrasound.Both serum AST and ALT increase with body weight but this is more prominent for ALT rather than AST.139 Most cases of elevated ALT can be attributed to being overweight (body �mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The five components that compose the metabolic syndrome 
are central (truncal) obesity, hyperglycaemia, low levels of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, 
and hypertension. Subjects with specified values for at least 
three of these components are considered to have metabolic 
syndrome. All the components of metabolic syndrome are 
univariate factors associated with elevated ALT. Fasting 
serum insulin levels and other markers of insulin resistance 
were associated with elevated ALT independent of BMI and 
waist circumference.

true sensitivity and specificity of liver enzyme elevations for detection of NAFLD is unknown because of the interaction 
between the relatively small increases in ALT (and AST) 
but the relatively large differences in laboratory reference 
limits for these serum enzymes. Reference limits have 
often been derived using reference populations that include 
high prevalence of obesity in the mistaken reassurance that 
excluding alcoholism or known chronic liver disease is a 
sufficient precaution to ensure the reference population does 
not have liver dysfunction. While the elevation in ALT in fatty liver may be assumed to be due to liver damage, evidence of liver damage is not 
always evident.144 There is evidence of increased apoptosis, including caspase activation and cytokeratin 18 breakdown.

waist circumference. At least 40% of patients with NAFLD 
fulfil the criteria for metabolic syndrome and subjects 
with metabolic syndrome are more likely to have elevated 
ALT.140,141 Whereas in alcoholic steatohepatitis the De Ritis ratio is always over 1.0,142 in patients with NASH the AST/ALT ratio is <1 particularly in morbidly obese patients.143 Not surprisingly, patients with NAFLD have a higher mortality 
rate than the general population and are at increased risk of 
developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the future.Increased aminotransferase activities are the most common abnormality reported in patients with NASH, however the

The predominance of AST over ALT in alcohol-related liver 
disease was first reported by Harinasuta et al. in 1967.85 Many authors have since described AST/ALT ratios greater 
than 1.5 or greater than 2.0 as being highly suggestive of 
alcoholic hepatitis.86-89 Takahashi et al.

ratio above 1 but a 
high AST/ALT ratio is suggestive of either recent exposure or 
advanced alcoholic liver disease.105 The transaminases alone, or in combination, were not helpful in identifying heavy 
drinking in the NHANES study106 and others have found that the AST/ALT ratio may fall with increasing consumption.107Another argument that the association of an AST/ALT ratio 
of over 2.0 with alcoholic cirrhosis is more to do with recent 
alcohol exposure rather than cirrhosis per se is the fact that other 
causes of liver related death such as primary biliary cirrhosis108 and primary sclerosing cholangitis109 are associated with AST/

hepatitis can have ALT greater than AST when several days have elapsed since alcohol exposure. The ratio 
therefore represents the time course and aggressiveness of disease that would be predicted from the relatively short half-life of 
AST (18 h) compared to ALT (36 h). In chronic viral illnesses such as chronic viral hepatitis and chronic alcoholism as well 
as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, an elevated AST/ALT ratio is predictive of long terms complications including fibrosis 
and cirrhosis. There are methodological issues, particularly whether or not pyridoxal phosphate is used in the transaminase 
assays, and although this can have specific effects when patient samples are deficient in this vitamin, these method differences 
generally have mild effects on the usefulness of the assays or the ratio. Ideally laboratories should be using pyridoxal phosphate 
supplemented assays in alcoholic, elderly and cancer patients who may be pyridoxine deplete.

ecent papers also quote these 
ratios of over 1.5 or 2.0 as being strongly suggestive or indicative of alcohol abuse.91,92 Most patients with alcoholic liver disease will have AST/ALT ratios below 2.0 and many 
below 1.0, which could conceivably be because some patients 
could have coexisting alcoholic as well as viral liver disease.93The reasons for a classical 2:1 excess of serum AST activity 
compared to serum ALT activity in alcoholic hepatitis have 
been attributed to (i) decreased ALT activity94 most likely due to B6 depletion in the livers of alcoholics95 and/or (ii) mitochondrial damage leading to increased release of mAST 
in serum.96 This is supported by the finding that normally most of the AST activity in serum is the cytosolic isoenzyme,97 however in alcoholism mAST is preferentially released.98 Specificity can be improved using the mAST/AST ratio99 although sensitivity is decreased.100,101AST/ALT ratios below 1.0 are not uncommon in alcoholic 
liver disease and in an Aust

ct the cellular proportions where AST 
is over twice as prevalent than ALT.5 The Use of Enzyme Ratios
De Ritis described the AST/ALT ratio as being a useful 
indicator of the aetiology of hepatitis (e.g. acute viral 
hepatitis)1 and his work was confirmed and extended by Wroblewski.6 Over the following decades, subsequent studies using improved transaminase methods continued to confirm 
the original work.7-9Other enzyme ratios have also been suggested to have similar 
utility for identification of viral hepatitis such as the ratio of 
the sum of serum AST+ALT activities divided by the serum

an elevated ALT and AST in both men and 
women.120 Obesity has a greater impact than moderate or heavy alcohol use121 however when obesity and alcohol are both present they have a multiplicative rather than additive 
interaction.122 Paradoxically, obesity is the most likely cause of a raised ALT in men123 while alcohol was the more likely cause of an elevated ALT in women.Studies have suggested an integral role of the cytochrome P450 enzyme ‘CYP2E1’ in the pathogenesis of fatty liver 
disease due to alcohol and obesity.124 It is well accepted that both diet-induced obesity and increased alcohol consumption 
lead to induction of CYP2E1 in the liver, which may explain 
the synergistic effect of these two factors in causing liver 
injury or elevated serum ALT and AST.125Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD)
The prevalence of NAFLD is over 20% in developed countries 
and nearly 10% in developing nations, making NAFLD the 
most common liver condition in the world.

injury.48Acute Viral Hepatitis
While it is clearly recognised that serum levels of both serum 
ALT and AST are elevated several fold in ‘acute’ viral hepatitis 
(e.g. hepatitis A and E), De Ritis was the first to describe that 
the ALT is usually higher than the AST with the AST/ALT 
ratio usually well below 1.0, and typically in the range 0.5 to 
0.7.49-54 It is important to note that the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis today (when serology and PCR can clearly diagnose 
a viral cause) is very different to that question 60 years ago. 
Nevertheless, even today, when transaminases are elevated 
several fold, a low De Ritis ratio still provides an important 
clue to aetiology of acute hepatitis.Investigators have however noted that acute viral hepatitis can occasionally cause a high AST/ALT ratio of up to 2.0, 
however these are atypical cases representing fulminant 
hepatitis where there is often a very poor prognosis.

says or the ratio. Ideally laboratories should be using pyridoxal phosphate 
supplemented assays in alcoholic, elderly and cancer patients who may be pyridoxine deplete. Ideally all laboratories reporting 
abnormal ALT should also report AST and calculate the De Ritis ratio because it provides useful diagnostic and prognostic 
information.IntroductionThe ratio of the serum activities of AST and ALT was first 
described by Fernando De Ritis in 19571 and has been known ever since as the De Ritis ratio. ALT and AST are commonly 
requested blood tests for liver disease. They are part of the 
commonly requested ‘Liver Function Test’ (LFT) panel, but 
rather than assessing functions of the liver, the release of 
ALT and AST from liver cells to the bloodstream represents 
hepatocellular damage or death.
