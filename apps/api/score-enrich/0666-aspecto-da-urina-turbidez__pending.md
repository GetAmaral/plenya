**Article:** Diagnostic Utility of Urine Microscopy in Kidney Diseases (2024)
**Journal:** Indian Journal of Nephrology
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.571

Urine sediment analysis is a highly valuable yet underutilized test in contemporary medicine. Microscopic examination represents a simple, cost-effective, and powerful diagnostic tool for nephrologists, particularly beneficial in acute kidney injury contexts. The review discusses how timely sediment analysis enables compartmental AKI diagnosis and prognostic guidance. A key concern raised is that automated systems fail identifying pathological casts, crystals, and dysmorphic red blood cells, necessitating renewed focus on manual microscopic analysis for accurate identification of renal tubular epithelial cells and other critical urinary particles.

nalyzers identify RBCs by ow cytometry (for example, UF-1000i urine analyzer, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) or analysis of digitalized images of the urine sediment (for example, Cobas 6500 urine analyzer, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)7,8. e analyzers have good performance for the identication of isomorphic RBCs as in extraglomerular  hematuria9.In glomerular disease, the presence of hematuria is a key factor in dierentiating nephritic disease from nephrotic disease. Recently, more attention has been paid to hematuria in glomerular disease because hematuria was shown to have a negative prognostic  impact10.Glomerular hematuria is dierent from extraglomerular hematuria in terms of the RBC morphology. RBCs from extraglomerular hematuria have an isomorphic appearance as seen in peripheral blood smears, whereas RBCs of glomerular origin are small and have a dysmorphic appearance with marked variability in size and  shape11.

pH of the urine was categorized as follows; 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8 and 9.e Urisys 2400 and Cobas u 601 urine analyzers both contain a built-in refractometer, and the specic gravity (SG) was measured via refractometry. e scale of urine SG ranged from 1.000 to 1.050. In dilute urine, the RBCs absorb water, swell, and may rupture. In concentrated urine, the RBCs tend to shrink and become crenated. A urine SG of 1.010 corresponds to approximately 300mOsm/kg, similar to the osmolarity of  plasma22, and a urine SG > 1.020 oen indicates  dehydration23. In this study, therefore, urine samples with SG < 1.010 and > 1.020 were considered dilute and concentrated urine, respectively.Statistical analysis. e data are expressed as the median (interquartile range). e values obtained for the two groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test.

Automated urine sediment analyzers underestimate the severity of hematuria in glomerular diseasesWon Seok YangHematuria, either glomerular or extraglomerular, is defined as 3 or more red blood cells (RBCs)/high power field. Currently, urinalyses are commonly performed using automated urine sediment analyzers. To assess whether RBC counting by automated urine sediment analyzers is reliable for defining hematuria in glomerular disease, random specimen urinalyses of men with nephritic glomerular disease (7674 urinalyses) and bladder cancer (12,510 urinalyses) were retrospectively reviewed. Urine RBCs were counted by an automated urine sediment analyzer based on flow cytometry (UF-1000i, Sysmex Corporation) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable.

etiologic agent 
[1,2]
. Early detection and timely and adequate treatment of the disease are critical to
preventing major complications such as renal scarring, hypertension, and chronic renal failure 
[3,4]
.
Regarding the rising treatment resistance of microorganisms causing UTIs, appropriate selection of the
initial antibiotic before collecting urine culture and antibiogram results are critical 
[1,2,5-9]
. The question is
whether it is possible to predict microorganism resistance using markers, such as the nitrite test, prior to
preparing urine cultures and antibiogram results. According to Weisz et al., urine nitrite results can be used
to identify cephalosporin resistance 
[10]
. On the other hand, other studies contradict this viewpoint 
[11,12]
.
Antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, making infections more difficult to treat, and is related to
increased mortality, morbidity, and cost

**Journal:** American Journal of Kidney Diseases
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.536

This comprehensive review covers the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections. The urinary tract from kidneys to urethral meatus is normally sterile and resistant to bacterial colonization. Mucus layer plays a protective role in the urothelium. During infections, the recovery of the superficial urothelium and protective mucus layer may be delayed with recurrent infections. The presence of mucus in urinalysis may indicate inflammation or contamination.

**Article:** Outpatient crystalluria: prevalence, crystal types, and associations with comorbidities and urinary tract infections at a provincial hospital (2025)
**Journal:** Iranian Journal of Microbiology
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.526

Background and Objectives: Crystalluria refers to the occurrence of crystals in urine resulting from urinary supersaturation, which disrupts the balance between factors that promote and those that inhibit crystal formation in urine. This study examined crystalluria occurrence in 1,025 urine samples from outpatients at a provincial hospital. Results: 22.04% of samples showed crystalluria with mean patient age of 51.3 years. The most common crystal types were calcium oxalate (46.4%), uric acid (23.5%), urates (15.1%) and struvite (9.3%). Diabetes, kidney failure, prostatitis, and nephrotic syndrome were associated with crystal formation. The prevalence of urinary tract infections in patients with urinary crystals was 10.6%. Notably, struvite crystals correlated with bacterial infections. Conclusion: Monitoring crystals is vital for preventing kidney stone development and infection-related complications in susceptible populations.

**Article:** Proteinuria (2023)
**Journal:** StatPearls Publishing
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.524

Comprehensive clinical review of proteinuria covering definition, etiology, diagnosis, and management. Proteinuria serves as a marker of kidney damage assisting with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Normal protein excretion is <150 mg/24 hours. Severity categories: nephritic range (150-3,500 mg/24h) and nephrotic range (>3,500 mg/24h). Urine dipstick provides semi-quantitative screening but has important limitations: false-positives with dehydration, alkaline urine, UTI; inability to detect positively charged proteins. UK CKD guidelines define significant proteinuria as UPCR >45 mg/mmol. Quantitative methods (spot UPCR preferred for convenience and reliability, or 24-hour urine collection for accuracy) are indicated when dipstick is positive or proteinuria >1 g/day is suspected. Early detection and quantification are crucial given associations with progressive renal disease and cardiovascular complications.

**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.521

Urinalysis is a fundamental diagnostic tool used to evaluate urine composition through physical, chemical, and microscopic examination. The microscopic examination identifies cells, crystals, bacteria, mucus, and other substances. A small amount of mucus is normal in urine, produced by mucous membrane epithelial cells of the urinary tract. Increased amounts may indicate urinary tract infection, inflammation, or sample contamination.

s in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease. e Cobas 6500 urine analyzer may also give some false positive results for RBCs in patients with bladder cancer because 3 or more RBCs/HPF despite a negative result in the dipstick test was more frequent in patients with bladder cancer than in those with glomerular disease.In urologic malignancies, hematuria is intermittent, and the level of microscopic hematuria does not indicate the seriousness of the  disease30, and it is important to determine the presence or absence of hematuria. If adults older than 40years test positive for hematuria, a urologic investigation is required to exclude malignancy. Because the dipstick test detects heme from hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and glomerular hematuria as well as extra-glomerular hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.

This study investigated associations between manual urinary sediment particles and histologic lesions identified through kidney biopsy in 131 patients. Key findings revealed that urinary lipids correlated with mesangial expansion and renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) associated with endocapillary hypercellularity and cellular crescents. Manual microscopic evaluation identified particles including dysmorphic erythrocytes, RTECs, and lipids that automated analyzers frequently miss, suggesting these findings warrant kidney biopsy consideration and highlighting the clinical importance of proper epithelial cell identification.

ion) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable. In the urine specimens with specific gravity ≥ 1.010, RBC counts measured using either UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 were well correlated with the positive grades in the dipstick blood test. However, at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, RBC counts were graded significantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer. The findings suggest that RBC counting by UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs in glomerular disease are susceptible to hemolysis and/or fail to be properly recognized.Hematuria can occur in glomerular diseases as well as extraglomerular diseases, including urologic malignan-cies. It is detected in the urinalysis by either a dipstick test or microscopic examination of urine sediment.

be performed using the rst-morning specimen. However, randomly voided urine is the most commonly used specimen for urinalysisbecause it is easiest to obtain, as it was in this study. With the randomly voided urine, 1822% of the urine specimens had SG < 1.010, which made the assessment of hematuria by RBC counting unreliable due to hypotonic lysis of RBCs.Even in urine specimens with SG ≥ 1.010, the RBC counts can be aected by the level of urine concentration, with a higher number of RBCs in more concentrated urine. However, the RBC counts are reported without a correction for the degree of urine concentration, and thus do not allow quantitative assessment of hematuria.

terioration of glomerular ltration in chronic kidney  disease32,33 and diabetic  nephropathy34; however, the grading of hematuria severity was not included in the analysis.Considering the signicance of hematuria in glomerular disease, the severity of hematuria needs to be assessed accurately. However, the current study suggests that automated urine sediment analyzers do not reliably detect RBCs of glomerular origin, and the dening hematuria based on RBC numbers may result in hematuria not being detected or in the severity of hematuria being underestimated in glomerular disease.Besides the urinalysis method being used, the collection of an adequate urine specimen is a prerequisite for accurate urine sediment examination. To avoid collecting dilute urine, it is recommended that urinalysis be performed using the rst-morning specimen. However, randomly voided urine is the most commonly used specimen for urinalysisbecause it is easiest to obtain, as it was in this study.

have more advantages for the follow-up of hematuria in cases of glomerular disease, as the results can be positive due to dysmorphic RBCs as well as isomorphic RBCs; further, hematuria can be detected in dilute urine specimens by the presence of heme released from lysed  RBCs27.is study has some limitations. First, automated urinary sediment examination was not compared with the manual microscopic examination, which is recommended in the evaluation of urine sediments in patients with glomerular disease. e latter, however, should be performed by experts under standard conditions and is not feasible where a large number of samples need to be processed quickly. Furthermore, RBC counting under the manual microscopic examination is also not accurate and is subject to wide interobserver  variability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36.
