### Chunk 1/30
**Article:** Urinary Sediment Microscopy and Correlations with Kidney Biopsy: Red Flags Not To Be Missed (2022)
**Journal:** Kidney360
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.688

This study investigated associations between manual urinary sediment particles and histologic lesions identified through kidney biopsy in 131 patients. Key findings revealed that urinary lipids correlated with mesangial expansion and renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) associated with endocapillary hypercellularity and cellular crescents. Manual microscopic evaluation identified particles including dysmorphic erythrocytes, RTECs, and lipids that automated analyzers frequently miss, suggesting these findings warrant kidney biopsy consideration and highlighting the clinical importance of proper epithelial cell identification.

**Article:** Survey on reporting of epithelial cells in urine sediment as part of external quality assessment programs in Brazilian laboratories (2021)
**Journal:** Biochem Med (Zagreb)
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.640

This research investigates how Brazilian laboratories report epithelial cells during urine microscopy examination. The study surveyed 1,336 laboratories participating in an external quality assessment program, organizing them by their classification methods. Key findings revealed that while most laboratories recognize the clinical significance of distinguishing renal tubular epithelial cells from other epithelial subtypes, the majority do not currently differentiate between the three main types. The authors conclude that education of laboratory staff about the clinical significance of urinary particles should be considered a key priority.

**Article:** Diagnostic Utility of Urine Microscopy in Kidney Diseases (2024)
**Journal:** Indian Journal of Nephrology
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.640

Urine sediment analysis is a highly valuable yet underutilized test in contemporary medicine. Microscopic examination represents a simple, cost-effective, and powerful diagnostic tool for nephrologists, particularly beneficial in acute kidney injury contexts. The review discusses how timely sediment analysis enables compartmental AKI diagnosis and prognostic guidance. A key concern raised is that automated systems fail identifying pathological casts, crystals, and dysmorphic red blood cells, necessitating renewed focus on manual microscopic analysis for accurate identification of renal tubular epithelial cells and other critical urinary particles.

Automated urine sediment analyzers underestimate the severity of hematuria in glomerular diseasesWon Seok YangHematuria, either glomerular or extraglomerular, is defined as 3 or more red blood cells (RBCs)/high power field. Currently, urinalyses are commonly performed using automated urine sediment analyzers. To assess whether RBC counting by automated urine sediment analyzers is reliable for defining hematuria in glomerular disease, random specimen urinalyses of men with nephritic glomerular disease (7674 urinalyses) and bladder cancer (12,510 urinalyses) were retrospectively reviewed. Urine RBCs were counted by an automated urine sediment analyzer based on flow cytometry (UF-1000i, Sysmex Corporation) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable.

terioration of glomerular ltration in chronic kidney  disease32,33 and diabetic  nephropathy34; however, the grading of hematuria severity was not included in the analysis.Considering the signicance of hematuria in glomerular disease, the severity of hematuria needs to be assessed accurately. However, the current study suggests that automated urine sediment analyzers do not reliably detect RBCs of glomerular origin, and the dening hematuria based on RBC numbers may result in hematuria not being detected or in the severity of hematuria being underestimated in glomerular disease.Besides the urinalysis method being used, the collection of an adequate urine specimen is a prerequisite for accurate urine sediment examination. To avoid collecting dilute urine, it is recommended that urinalysis be performed using the rst-morning specimen. However, randomly voided urine is the most commonly used specimen for urinalysisbecause it is easiest to obtain, as it was in this study.

nalyzers identify RBCs by ow cytometry (for example, UF-1000i urine analyzer, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) or analysis of digitalized images of the urine sediment (for example, Cobas 6500 urine analyzer, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)7,8. e analyzers have good performance for the identication of isomorphic RBCs as in extraglomerular  hematuria9.In glomerular disease, the presence of hematuria is a key factor in dierentiating nephritic disease from nephrotic disease. Recently, more attention has been paid to hematuria in glomerular disease because hematuria was shown to have a negative prognostic  impact10.Glomerular hematuria is dierent from extraglomerular hematuria in terms of the RBC morphology. RBCs from extraglomerular hematuria have an isomorphic appearance as seen in peripheral blood smears, whereas RBCs of glomerular origin are small and have a dysmorphic appearance with marked variability in size and  shape11.

have more advantages for the follow-up of hematuria in cases of glomerular disease, as the results can be positive due to dysmorphic RBCs as well as isomorphic RBCs; further, hematuria can be detected in dilute urine specimens by the presence of heme released from lysed  RBCs27.is study has some limitations. First, automated urinary sediment examination was not compared with the manual microscopic examination, which is recommended in the evaluation of urine sediments in patients with glomerular disease. e latter, however, should be performed by experts under standard conditions and is not feasible where a large number of samples need to be processed quickly. Furthermore, RBC counting under the manual microscopic examination is also not accurate and is subject to wide interobserver  variability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36.

ed from the RBCs is still detected by the dipstick  test27. Besides, auto-mated urine sediment analyzers detect isomorphic RBCs well but may not be good at detecting dysmorphic  RBCs8,28,29.e UF-1000i urine analyzer counts RBCs by ow cytometry, whereas the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer identies RBCs by the analysis of digital images of the urine sediment. ough the two urine sediment analyzers counted fewer RBCs in patients with glomerular disease than in patients with bladder cancer for each positive dipstick blood test, the dierences in RBC numbers between patients with bladder cancer and patients with glomerular disease were greater with the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer than with the UF-1000i urine analyzer. is may be in part because the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer tended to count fewer RBCs in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease.

ion) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable. In the urine specimens with specific gravity ≥ 1.010, RBC counts measured using either UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 were well correlated with the positive grades in the dipstick blood test. However, at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, RBC counts were graded significantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer. The findings suggest that RBC counting by UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs in glomerular disease are susceptible to hemolysis and/or fail to be properly recognized.Hematuria can occur in glomerular diseases as well as extraglomerular diseases, including urologic malignan-cies. It is detected in the urinalysis by either a dipstick test or microscopic examination of urine sediment.

ability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36. However, bacterial peroxidase does not seem to account for the lower numbers of urinary RBCs in glomerular disease because urinary tract infection was not documented in the patients with glomerular disease during the study period. In contrast, ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid-containing so drinks may cause false-negative  results37; however, the patients included in this study were not questioned about this before obtaining urinalysis specimens.In conclusion, our data suggest that urine RBC counting by the UF-1000i urine analyzer or the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs are susceptible to hemolysis and/or are not properly recognized.Received: 8 July 2021; Accepted: 7 October 2021

dder cancer.Distributions of urine SG and pH. e SG of urine aects the morphology of RBCs and may thus alter the identication of RBCs via automated urine sediment analyzers. e distribution of the urine SG in each group is shown in Fig.1.In the data obtained via the UF-1000i urine analyzer, the SG of urine from patients with bladder cancer and glomerular disease was 1.015 (1.0101.020) and 1.014 (1.0101.019) (p < 0.001), respectively. e frequency of a dilute urine specimen with SG < 1.010 was 21.8% (1148/5271) among patients with bladder cancer and 22.3% (866/3892) among patients with glomerular disease.

minations were car-ried out using the UF-1000i urine analyzer (Sysmex Corporation). ereaer, the instrument for urinalysis was changed to the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). For the analysis of the UF-1000i urine analyzer data, the urinalyses of the patients with glomerular disease performed between January 2011 and Octo-ber 2016 and the urinalyses of the patients with bladder cancer performed between January 2013 and December 2015 were collected. For the analysis of the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer data, the urinalyses of the patients with glomerular disease performed between December 2016 and December 2020 and the urinalyses of the patients with bladder cancer performed between January 2017 and December 2019 were collected.For the patients with glomerular disease, some urinalyses were conducted the day aer the kidney biopsy, which may have caused extraglomerular hematuria. us, only urinalyses from outpatients, and not inpatients, were included.

. Early detection and timely and adequate treatment of the disease are critical to
preventing major complications such as renal scarring, hypertension, and chronic renal failure 
[3,4]
.
Regarding the rising treatment resistance of microorganisms causing UTIs, appropriate selection of the
initial antibiotic before collecting urine culture and antibiogram results are critical 
[1,2,5-9]
. The question is
whether it is possible to predict microorganism resistance using markers, such as the nitrite test, prior to
preparing urine cultures and antibiogram results. According to Weisz et al., urine nitrite results can be used
to identify cephalosporin resistance 
[10]
. On the other hand, other studies contradict this viewpoint 
[11,12]
.
Antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, making infections more difficult to treat, and is related to
increased mortality, morbidity, and cost

s in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease. e Cobas 6500 urine analyzer may also give some false positive results for RBCs in patients with bladder cancer because 3 or more RBCs/HPF despite a negative result in the dipstick test was more frequent in patients with bladder cancer than in those with glomerular disease.In urologic malignancies, hematuria is intermittent, and the level of microscopic hematuria does not indicate the seriousness of the  disease30, and it is important to determine the presence or absence of hematuria. If adults older than 40years test positive for hematuria, a urologic investigation is required to exclude malignancy. Because the dipstick test detects heme from hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and glomerular hematuria as well as extra-glomerular hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.

ular disease (p < 0.001).In the data obtained via the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer, the SG of urine from patients with bladder cancer and glomerular disease was 1.016 (1.0111.020) and 1.015 (1.0111.020) (p < 0.001), respectively. e frequency of a dilute urine specimen with SG < 1.010 was 18.1% (1310/7239) among patients with bladder cancer and 18.4% (696/3782) among patients with glomerular disease. In contrast, the frequency of a concentrated urine speci-men with SG > 1.020 was 24.9% (1806/7239) among patients with bladder cancer and 21.6% (816/3782) among patients with glomerular disease (p < 0.001).To examine the eects of high and low urine SG values on RBC counting via automated urine sediment analyzers, the RBC counts at each positive grade in the dipstick blood test were compared according to the SG. In most cases, the RBC counts were graded signicantly lower in urine specimens with SG < 1.010 than in those with SG 1.0101.020.
