ion) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable. In the urine specimens with specific gravity ≥ 1.010, RBC counts measured using either UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 were well correlated with the positive grades in the dipstick blood test. However, at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, RBC counts were graded significantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer. The findings suggest that RBC counting by UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs in glomerular disease are susceptible to hemolysis and/or fail to be properly recognized.Hematuria can occur in glomerular diseases as well as extraglomerular diseases, including urologic malignan-cies. It is detected in the urinalysis by either a dipstick test or microscopic examination of urine sediment.

nalyzers identify RBCs by ow cytometry (for example, UF-1000i urine analyzer, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) or analysis of digitalized images of the urine sediment (for example, Cobas 6500 urine analyzer, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)7,8. e analyzers have good performance for the identication of isomorphic RBCs as in extraglomerular  hematuria9.In glomerular disease, the presence of hematuria is a key factor in dierentiating nephritic disease from nephrotic disease. Recently, more attention has been paid to hematuria in glomerular disease because hematuria was shown to have a negative prognostic  impact10.Glomerular hematuria is dierent from extraglomerular hematuria in terms of the RBC morphology. RBCs from extraglomerular hematuria have an isomorphic appearance as seen in peripheral blood smears, whereas RBCs of glomerular origin are small and have a dysmorphic appearance with marked variability in size and  shape11.

Comprehensive clinical guidelines for hematuria evaluation. Microhematuria is defined as 3 or more urinary RBCs per high-power field requiring microscopic confirmation. Risk stratification includes low-risk (<1% cancer risk), intermediate-risk (0.2-3.1% risk), and high-risk (1.3-6.3% risk) categories based on age, smoking history, and RBC count. Differential diagnosis distinguishes glomerular causes (proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, casts) from nonglomerular causes (urological pathology). Cystoscopy remains 98% sensitive for bladder cancer detection and is underutilized.

have more advantages for the follow-up of hematuria in cases of glomerular disease, as the results can be positive due to dysmorphic RBCs as well as isomorphic RBCs; further, hematuria can be detected in dilute urine specimens by the presence of heme released from lysed  RBCs27.is study has some limitations. First, automated urinary sediment examination was not compared with the manual microscopic examination, which is recommended in the evaluation of urine sediments in patients with glomerular disease. e latter, however, should be performed by experts under standard conditions and is not feasible where a large number of samples need to be processed quickly. Furthermore, RBC counting under the manual microscopic examination is also not accurate and is subject to wide interobserver  variability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36.

Automated urine sediment analyzers underestimate the severity of hematuria in glomerular diseasesWon Seok YangHematuria, either glomerular or extraglomerular, is defined as 3 or more red blood cells (RBCs)/high power field. Currently, urinalyses are commonly performed using automated urine sediment analyzers. To assess whether RBC counting by automated urine sediment analyzers is reliable for defining hematuria in glomerular disease, random specimen urinalyses of men with nephritic glomerular disease (7674 urinalyses) and bladder cancer (12,510 urinalyses) were retrospectively reviewed. Urine RBCs were counted by an automated urine sediment analyzer based on flow cytometry (UF-1000i, Sysmex Corporation) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable.

s in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease. e Cobas 6500 urine analyzer may also give some false positive results for RBCs in patients with bladder cancer because 3 or more RBCs/HPF despite a negative result in the dipstick test was more frequent in patients with bladder cancer than in those with glomerular disease.In urologic malignancies, hematuria is intermittent, and the level of microscopic hematuria does not indicate the seriousness of the  disease30, and it is important to determine the presence or absence of hematuria. If adults older than 40years test positive for hematuria, a urologic investigation is required to exclude malignancy. Because the dipstick test detects heme from hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and glomerular hematuria as well as extra-glomerular hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.

terioration of glomerular ltration in chronic kidney  disease32,33 and diabetic  nephropathy34; however, the grading of hematuria severity was not included in the analysis.Considering the signicance of hematuria in glomerular disease, the severity of hematuria needs to be assessed accurately. However, the current study suggests that automated urine sediment analyzers do not reliably detect RBCs of glomerular origin, and the dening hematuria based on RBC numbers may result in hematuria not being detected or in the severity of hematuria being underestimated in glomerular disease.Besides the urinalysis method being used, the collection of an adequate urine specimen is a prerequisite for accurate urine sediment examination. To avoid collecting dilute urine, it is recommended that urinalysis be performed using the rst-morning specimen. However, randomly voided urine is the most commonly used specimen for urinalysisbecause it is easiest to obtain, as it was in this study.

r hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy. us, hematuria is dened as ≥ 3 RBCs/HPF and this is the widely accepted denition across uro-logic  societies3,4; furthermore, the dipstick hematuria test is not considered sucient to mandate an evaluation.In glomerular disease, however, the amount of hematuria may be more important than the presence or absence of hematuria because high-grade hematuria suggests a nephritic glomerular disease  in the dierential diagnosis and may also indicate a worse renal prognosis.In a recent  study31, urine dipstick hematuria was shown to be useful in dierentiating proliferative glomeru-lonephritis from other causes of kidney diseases, with higher positive grades in the dipstick blood test associated with higher positive predictive values.e association of hematuria with adverse renal outcomes has also been reported in glomerular diseases.

Test strips in the Urisys 2400 cassettes and the cobas u packs were used with the Urisys 2400 analyzer and the Cobas u 601 analyzer, respectively. In both analyzers, dipstick hematuria was graded as −, ±, 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+.

Besides, auto-mated urine sediment analyzers detect isomorphic RBCs well but may not be good at detecting dysmorphic  RBCs8,28,29.e UF-1000i urine analyzer counts RBCs by ow cytometry, whereas the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer identies RBCs by the analysis of digital images of the urine sediment. ough the two urine sediment analyzers counted fewer RBCs in patients with glomerular disease than in patients with bladder cancer for each positive dipstick blood test, the dierences in RBC numbers between patients with bladder cancer and patients with glomerular disease were greater with the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer than with the UF-1000i urine analyzer. is may be in part because the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer tended to count fewer RBCs in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease.

ability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36. However, bacterial peroxidase does not seem to account for the lower numbers of urinary RBCs in glomerular disease because urinary tract infection was not documented in the patients with glomerular disease during the study period. In contrast, ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid-containing so drinks may cause false-negative  results37; however, the patients included in this study were not questioned about this before obtaining urinalysis specimens.In conclusion, our data suggest that urine RBC counting by the UF-1000i urine analyzer or the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs are susceptible to hemolysis and/or are not properly recognized.Received: 8 July 2021; Accepted: 7 October 2021

For both bladder cancer and glomerular disease, the grades of hematuria measured using the dipstick were well correlated with urine RBC counts measured via the automated urine sediment analyzers. In dilute or highly alkaline urine, RBCs may undergo lysis. Even aer dilute or alkaline urine specimens were excluded, however, there were urinalyses with a positive dipstick testfor blood but negative or relatively few RBCs, suggesting that some RBCs are degraded before urinalysis or are not detected.

Such urinalyses were more frequent in cases of glomerular disease than in cases of bladder cancer, and at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, the RBC counts were signicantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer.In glomerular hematuria, RBCs pass through the glomerular ltration barrier and the convoluted tubules, which may distort the RBC morphology. RBCs may undergo lysis during this passage, or the morphologically altered RBCs can be more vulnerable to  hemolysis26. If RBCs are degraded, they are not detected by microscopic examination, but the hemoglobin released from the RBCs is still detected by the dipstick  test27.

ular disease (p < 0.001).In the data obtained via the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer, the SG of urine from patients with bladder cancer and glomerular disease was 1.016 (1.0111.020) and 1.015 (1.0111.020) (p < 0.001), respectively. e frequency of a dilute urine specimen with SG < 1.010 was 18.1% (1310/7239) among patients with bladder cancer and 18.4% (696/3782) among patients with glomerular disease. In contrast, the frequency of a concentrated urine speci-men with SG > 1.020 was 24.9% (1806/7239) among patients with bladder cancer and 21.6% (816/3782) among patients with glomerular disease (p < 0.001).To examine the eects of high and low urine SG values on RBC counting via automated urine sediment analyzers, the RBC counts at each positive grade in the dipstick blood test were compared according to the SG. In most cases, the RBC counts were graded signicantly lower in urine specimens with SG < 1.010 than in those with SG 1.0101.020.

Urine sediment analysis is a highly valuable yet underutilized test in contemporary medicine. Microscopic examination represents a simple, cost-effective, and powerful diagnostic tool for nephrologists, particularly beneficial in acute kidney injury contexts. The review discusses how timely sediment analysis enables compartmental AKI diagnosis and prognostic guidance. A key concern raised is that automated systems fail identifying pathological casts, crystals, and dysmorphic red blood cells, necessitating renewed focus on manual microscopic analysis for accurate identification of renal tubular epithelial cells and other critical urinary particles.
