Graves disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by activation of the TSH receptor by stimulatory autoantibodies (TSH Receptor Antibodies, or TRAbs), leading to unregulated thyroid hormone production. Diagnosis is largely based on the typical clinical picture and laboratory thyroid panel. Establishment of elevated serum levels of TRAbs by competitive binding assay or cell-binding assay has its unique role in diagnosis and management of GD, especially in the diﬀerential diagnosis, therapy selection, prognostication, evaluation of thyroid function during preg-nancy, peri-conceptional and neonatal thyroid workup, and in certain special situation. Inclusion of TRAbs in GD diagnostic algorithm can improve cost-eﬀectiveness of GD management. The current best practice guidelines were developed to provide evidence-based recommendations in the use of TRABs in GD management for healthcare providers in South Asia. A panel of endocrinologists with minimum 10 years of clinical experience in thyroid disorders reviewed existing literature and their quality, and after deliberation and discussion, developed 21 recommendations surrounding the best practices surrounding the role of TRAbs in GD management.

d their quality, and after deliberation and discussion, developed 21 recommendations surrounding the best practices surrounding the role of TRAbs in GD management.Keywords Graves disease, TSH receptor antibodies, TRAbs, South Asia, Best practices, Diagnosis, Prognosis, Monitoring
BackgroundGraves disease (GD) is the most frequent cause of hyper-thyroidism globally, aﬀecting 2030 out of 100,000 peo-ple in iodine-rich regions of the world each year [1]. GD accounts for around 60%-80% of all cases of clinical hyperthyroidism, and is said to aﬀect 1.2% of US adults [2]. While pan-India epidemiological data is lacking, regional estimates suggest that the prevalence of GD in India is also similar, with GD contributing to around 5080% of the aetiology of hyperthyroidism [1]. It is esti-mated that GD is prevalent in around 16.7% of the adult population in India [1]. GD aﬀects women more often, with a female: male ratio of around 510:1 [1].

nical picture and laboratory thyroid panel. Establishment of elevated serum levels of TRAbs by competitive binding assay or cell-binding assay has its unique role in diagnosis and management of GD, especially in the diﬀerential diagnosis, therapy selection, prognostication, evaluation of thyroid function during preg-nancy, peri-conceptional and neonatal thyroid workup, and in certain special situation. Inclusion of TRAbs in GD diagnostic algorithm can improve cost-eﬀectiveness of GD management. The current best practice guidelines were developed to provide evidence-based recommendations in the use of TRABs in GD management for healthcare providers in South Asia.

iditis presenting as clinical hyperthyroidism from GDLow/ ModerateConditionalR18. Low TRAbs level, along with small thyroid gland size, are associated with higher possibility of remis-sion in paediatric GDModerateStrongR19. Stopping of ATD therapy in paediatric GD patients should be based on TRAbs level after at least 3 years of ATD therapy, and treatment should be continued for 5 years or potentially longer for patients with high TRAbs levelsModerateStrongR20. Baseline TRAbs value can provide prognosis about the risk of patients developing severe TAO, but evi-dence is insuﬃcient to recommend using TRAbs level for treatment decisions in TAOLow/ ModerateConditionalR21.

or thyrotoxicosis due to recent excess iodine or thyroid hormone intake. Further, RAIU results are aﬀected by factors such as recent iodine contrast media exposure and ingestion of diet rich in iodine, and also require dedi-cated setup and technical expertise.ough thyroid ultrasound scan can reliably iden-tify thyroid overactivity by measuring increased thyroid blood ﬂow, it requires technical expertise. By contrast, estimation of TRAbs is cost-eﬀective by 47%, and improves time to diagnosis by 46%, compared to non-TRAbs modes of diagnosis [24]. Being laboratory-based, TRAbs estimation does not require a dedicated setup or special technical expertise.
