ed to infection
caused by enzyme-deficient bacteria or low-grade bacteriuria. A positive nitrite test result is fairly specific
for UTI, mainly due to urease-positive organisms such as 
Proteus 
species and, on rare occasions, 
E. coli
;
nevertheless, it is very insensitive as a screening tool, with only 25% of UTI patients having a positive nitrite
test result.
The link between urinary nitrite and UTIs was initially documented in 1914 and has since been the subject of
extensive attention 
[2]
. The benefits of using urinary nitrites include the low cost, the speed with which the
results are provided, and the ability to categorize patients into two distinct groups - nitrite positive or
negative 
[14]
.
Knowing the pathogen spectrum and resistance patterns in the community allows the physician to choose
an effective empiric agent. There has been little research on whether the absence of urine nitrites reflects
resistance to popular antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated UTIs.

Escherichia coli

etiologic agent 
[1,2]
. Early detection and timely and adequate treatment of the disease are critical to
preventing major complications such as renal scarring, hypertension, and chronic renal failure 
[3,4]
.
Regarding the rising treatment resistance of microorganisms causing UTIs, appropriate selection of the
initial antibiotic before collecting urine culture and antibiogram results are critical 
[1,2,5-9]
. The question is
whether it is possible to predict microorganism resistance using markers, such as the nitrite test, prior to
preparing urine cultures and antibiogram results. According to Weisz et al., urine nitrite results can be used
to identify cephalosporin resistance 
[10]
. On the other hand, other studies contradict this viewpoint 
[11,12]
.
Antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, making infections more difficult to treat, and is related to
increased mortality, morbidity, and cost 
[13,14]
.

resistance to popular antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated UTIs. Furthermore, the findings of the few
studies that have looked into this correlation are contradictory 
[15]
. This study aimed to investigate if nitrite
findings in urinalysis could be utilized to guide bacterial isolate and resistance when treating UTIs.
Materials And Methods
The urine samples of 59 adult outpatients with a mean age of 37 years and a diagnosis of UTI were reviewed.
The Urology Department at Tbilisi State Medical University (TSMU) the First University Clinic provided
samples throughout a six-month period (April-October 2020). Patients who were below the age of 18 years,
who did not have a urine culture sent to the laboratory, or those with the diagnosis of UTI but a negative
culture were excluded from the study.

 3: Frequency of isolated uropathogens
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to see if the presence of urine nitrite could help clinicians choose the most
appropriate empirical antibiotic before the bacteriological analysis findings. Commonly seen pathogens in
complicated UTIs which do not convert nitrates to nitrites include 
Enterococcus
, 
Pseudomonas
, and
Acinetobacter 
[16]
.
Weisz et al. stated that urine nitrite results are a useful sign of resistance to empiric therapy with first- and
third-generation cephalosporins 
[10]
. In our study, we subjected nitrite-positive and nitrite-negative groups
to second and third-generation cephalosporins including cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and
ceftazidime. In our study, only cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone revealed a statistically significant
difference (p ≤ 0.05) among these four antibiotics.
Larson et al. compared the sensitivity of nitrite-positive and nitrite-negative cultures to TMP-SMX.

Introduction
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease. It is caused by pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria,
viruses, or fungi) invading the urinary tract system 
[1,2]
. Cystitis, pyelonephritis, and asymptomatic
bacteriuria are the three manifestations of the condition 
[1,2]
. In 70%-90% of cases, 
Escherichia coli

Objective
This study aims to determine the relationship between the presence of urinary nitrite and bacterial
resistance to antimicrobial therapy in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
Methods
During a six-month time period (April-October, 2020), we reviewed the urine samples of 59 adult
outpatients from the Urology Department of Tbilisi State Medical University the First University Clinic with
the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. The infecting microorganisms and the presence of urine nitrite were
recorded. Resistance rates to the antibiotics were compared between the positive and negative nitrite
groups. Chi-squared test was used to perform the statistical analysis using Prism software version 9.3.1
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, California).
Results
We examined the correlation between the nitrite-positive and -negative groups with the resistance pattern
to ceftriaxone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ampicillin-sulbactam, fosfomycin, amikacin,
doxycycline, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and nitrofurantoin.
A total of 59 outpatients with a mean age of 37 years met the inclusion criteria between April and October
2020. In the positive and negative nitrite groups, there were 23 and 36 patients, respectively. Three (17.6%)
of the 17 gram-positive organisms and 20 (62.5%) of the 42 gram-negative organisms yielded positive nitrite
results.
In nitrite-positive group, resistance rates to ceftriaxone, TMP-SMX, ampicillin-sulbactam, fosfomycin,
amikacin, doxycycline, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and nitrofurantoin were 52.2%, 70.8%, 63.5%,
67.7%, 25.8%, 31.9%, 29.6%, 32.5%, 22.5% and 83.8%, respectively. These values in the nitrite-negative
group were 6.5%, 41.3%, 60.7%, 72.9%, 49%, 3%, 2.3%, 3.3%, 4.3% and 81.9%, respectively.
Highest relative resistance rate was recorded against cefuroxime (12.9), followed by doxycycline (10.6),
cefotaxime (9.8), ceftriaxone (8.03), ceftazidime (5.2), TMP-SMX (1.71), ampicillin-sulbactam (1.05),
nitrofurantoin (1.02), fosfomycin (0.93), and amikacin (0.53).
The most commonly isolated pathogen was 
Escherichia coli
, which was detected in 35 (71%) isolates. Other
bacteria commonly found were 
Proteus 
spp in five (12%) isolates, 
Klebsiella
 spp in two (5%) isolates, and
Enterococcus 
in five (12%) isolates.
Conclusion
The findings revealed that out of 10 antibiotics, nitrite-positive groups demonstrated higher resistance only
against ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and doxycycline. Other antibiotics showed no statistically
significant differences in resistance. Furthermore, the highest relative resistance rate was recorded against
cefuroxime, whereas amikacin revealed the lowest. Therefore, we suggest physicians to not adjust antibiotic
therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) based on the presence of nitrite. Urine bacteriology should be
ordered.

infection 
[10]
.
The main limitation of our study was the sampling size. Despite the fact that we found a statistically
significant difference in resistance to four antibiotics, additional data is needed to draw a more certain
conclusion.
Conclusions
The findings revealed that out of 10 antibiotics, nitrite-positive groups demonstrated higher resistance only
against ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and doxycycline. Other antibiotics showed no statistically
significant differences in resistance. The highest relative resistance rate was recorded against cefuroxime,
whereas amikacin demonstrated the lowest.
Based on our findings, we suggest physicians to not adjust antibiotic therapy for UTIs based on the presence
of nitrite, and urine bacteriology should be ordered.

.
Antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, making infections more difficult to treat, and is related to
increased mortality, morbidity, and cost 
[13,14]
. A growing proportion of community-acquired
uncomplicated UTIs is caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. As a result, empirical therapy is
more likely to fail. Because there are no oral treatment alternatives, an increasing number of individuals
with uncomplicated UTIs require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.
Nitrite tests look for the metabolites of nitrite reductase, an enzyme generated by a variety of
microorganisms. Unless there is a UTI, these compounds are not generally present. This test has a sensitivity
and specificity of 25% and 94%-100%, respectively. The limited sensitivity has been linked to infection
caused by enzyme-deficient bacteria or low-grade bacteriuria.

the study since it is known that
Enterococci 
tend to be more susceptible to TMP-SMX therapy 
[17]
.
Enterococcus, a less common uropathogen, does not produce nitrite and has a unique treatment resistance
pattern 
[18]
. Because of the expression of low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins, all enterococci have
decreased sensitivity to penicillin and ampicillin but high-level resistance to most cephalosporins and all
semi-synthetic penicillins 
[19]
.
A urine pH below 6.0, the amount of bacteriuria, the short time between collection and testing, dilute urine,
and the presence of blood, urobilinogen, vitamin C, or medications can all cause a false-negative nitrite
result. In addition, although several uropathogens, including 
E. coli
, 
Klebsiella
, and 
Proteus
, can convert
nitrate to nitrite, others cannot. Therefore, the nitrite test cannot be used to detect the presence of bacterial
infection 
[10]
.
The main limitation of our study was the sampling size.

s in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease. e Cobas 6500 urine analyzer may also give some false positive results for RBCs in patients with bladder cancer because 3 or more RBCs/HPF despite a negative result in the dipstick test was more frequent in patients with bladder cancer than in those with glomerular disease.In urologic malignancies, hematuria is intermittent, and the level of microscopic hematuria does not indicate the seriousness of the  disease30, and it is important to determine the presence or absence of hematuria. If adults older than 40years test positive for hematuria, a urologic investigation is required to exclude malignancy. Because the dipstick test detects heme from hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and glomerular hematuria as well as extra-glomerular hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.
