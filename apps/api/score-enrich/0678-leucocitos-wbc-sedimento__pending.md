etiologic agent 
[1,2]
. Early detection and timely and adequate treatment of the disease are critical to
preventing major complications such as renal scarring, hypertension, and chronic renal failure 
[3,4]
.
Regarding the rising treatment resistance of microorganisms causing UTIs, appropriate selection of the
initial antibiotic before collecting urine culture and antibiogram results are critical 
[1,2,5-9]
. The question is
whether it is possible to predict microorganism resistance using markers, such as the nitrite test, prior to
preparing urine cultures and antibiogram results. According to Weisz et al., urine nitrite results can be used
to identify cephalosporin resistance 
[10]
. On the other hand, other studies contradict this viewpoint 
[11,12]
.
Antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, making infections more difficult to treat, and is related to
increased mortality, morbidity, and cost

an effective empiric agent. There has been little research on whether the absence of urine nitrites reflects
resistance to popular antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated UTIs. Furthermore, the findings of the few
studies that have looked into this correlation are contradictory 
[15]
. This study aimed to investigate if nitrite
findings in urinalysis could be utilized to guide bacterial isolate and resistance when treating UTIs.
Materials And Methods
The urine samples of 59 adult outpatients with a mean age of 37 years and a diagnosis of UTI were reviewed.
The Urology Department at Tbilisi State Medical University (TSMU) the First University Clinic provided
samples throughout a six-month period (April-October 2020). Patients who were below the age of 18 years,
who did not have a urine culture sent to the laboratory, or those with the diagnosis of UTI but a negative
culture were excluded from the study.

ed to infection
caused by enzyme-deficient bacteria or low-grade bacteriuria. A positive nitrite test result is fairly specific
for UTI, mainly due to urease-positive organisms such as 
Proteus 
species and, on rare occasions, 
E. coli
;
nevertheless, it is very insensitive as a screening tool, with only 25% of UTI patients having a positive nitrite
test result.
The link between urinary nitrite and UTIs was initially documented in 1914 and has since been the subject of
extensive attention 
[2]
. The benefits of using urinary nitrites include the low cost, the speed with which the
results are provided, and the ability to categorize patients into two distinct groups - nitrite positive or
negative 
[14]
.
Knowing the pathogen spectrum and resistance patterns in the community allows the physician to choose
an effective empiric agent. There has been little research on whether the absence of urine nitrites reflects
resistance to popular antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated UTIs.

Automated urine sediment analyzers underestimate the severity of hematuria in glomerular diseasesWon Seok YangHematuria, either glomerular or extraglomerular, is defined as 3 or more red blood cells (RBCs)/high power field. Currently, urinalyses are commonly performed using automated urine sediment analyzers. To assess whether RBC counting by automated urine sediment analyzers is reliable for defining hematuria in glomerular disease, random specimen urinalyses of men with nephritic glomerular disease (7674 urinalyses) and bladder cancer (12,510 urinalyses) were retrospectively reviewed. Urine RBCs were counted by an automated urine sediment analyzer based on flow cytometry (UF-1000i, Sysmex Corporation) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable.

This comprehensive review covers the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections. The urinary tract from kidneys to urethral meatus is normally sterile and resistant to bacterial colonization. Mucus layer plays a protective role in the urothelium. During infections, the recovery of the superficial urothelium and protective mucus layer may be delayed with recurrent infections. The presence of mucus in urinalysis may indicate inflammation or contamination.

Recently, more attention has been paid to hematuria in glomerular disease because hematuria was shown to have a negative prognostic  impact10.Glomerular hematuria is dierent from extraglomerular hematuria in terms of the RBC morphology. RBCs from extraglomerular hematuria have an isomorphic appearance as seen in peripheral blood smears, whereas RBCs of glomerular origin are small and have a dysmorphic appearance with marked variability in size and  shape11.

s in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease. e Cobas 6500 urine analyzer may also give some false positive results for RBCs in patients with bladder cancer because 3 or more RBCs/HPF despite a negative result in the dipstick test was more frequent in patients with bladder cancer than in those with glomerular disease.In urologic malignancies, hematuria is intermittent, and the level of microscopic hematuria does not indicate the seriousness of the  disease30, and it is important to determine the presence or absence of hematuria. If adults older than 40years test positive for hematuria, a urologic investigation is required to exclude malignancy. Because the dipstick test detects heme from hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and glomerular hematuria as well as extra-glomerular hematuria, there is a high probability of the result being a false positive for the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.

The purpose of this study was to see if the presence of urine nitrite could help clinicians choose the most
appropriate empirical antibiotic before the bacteriological analysis findings. Commonly seen pathogens in
complicated UTIs which do not convert nitrates to nitrites include 
Enterococcus

. In our study, we subjected nitrite-positive and nitrite-negative groups
to second and third-generation cephalosporins including cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and
ceftazidime. In our study, only cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone revealed a statistically significant
difference (p ≤ 0.05) among these four antibiotics.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease. It is caused by pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria,
viruses, or fungi) invading the urinary tract system 
[1,2]
. Cystitis, pyelonephritis, and asymptomatic
bacteriuria are the three manifestations of the condition 
[1,2]

ion) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable. In the urine specimens with specific gravity ≥ 1.010, RBC counts measured using either UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 were well correlated with the positive grades in the dipstick blood test. However, at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, RBC counts were graded significantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer. The findings suggest that RBC counting by UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs in glomerular disease are susceptible to hemolysis and/or fail to be properly recognized.Hematuria can occur in glomerular diseases as well as extraglomerular diseases, including urologic malignan-cies. It is detected in the urinalysis by either a dipstick test or microscopic examination of urine sediment.

Objective
This study aims to determine the relationship between the presence of urinary nitrite and bacterial
resistance to antimicrobial therapy in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
Methods
During a six-month time period (April-October, 2020), we reviewed the urine samples of 59 adult
outpatients from the Urology Department of Tbilisi State Medical University the First University Clinic with
the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. The infecting microorganisms and the presence of urine nitrite were
recorded. Resistance rates to the antibiotics were compared between the positive and negative nitrite
groups. Chi-squared test was used to perform the statistical analysis using Prism software version 9.3.1

We examined the correlation between the nitrite-positive and -negative groups with the resistance pattern
to ceftriaxone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ampicillin-sulbactam, fosfomycin, amikacin,
doxycycline, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and nitrofurantoin.
A total of 59 outpatients with a mean age of 37 years met the inclusion criteria between April and October
2020. In the positive and negative nitrite groups, there were 23 and 36 patients, respectively. Three (17.6%)
of the 17 gram-positive organisms and 20 (62.5%) of the 42 gram-negative organisms yielded positive nitrite
results.
In nitrite-positive group, resistance rates to ceftriaxone, TMP-SMX, ampicillin-sulbactam, fosfomycin,
amikacin, doxycycline, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and nitrofurantoin were 52.2%, 70.8%, 63.5%,
67.7%, 25.8%, 31.9%, 29.6%, 32.5%, 22.5% and 83.8%, respectively. These values in the nitrite-negative
group were 6.5%, 41.3%, 60.7%, 72.9%, 49%, 3%, 2.3%, 3.3%, 4.3% and 81.9%, respectively.
Highest relative resistance rate was recorded against cefuroxime (12.9), followed by doxycycline (10.6),
cefotaxime (9.8), ceftriaxone (8.03), ceftazidime (5.2), TMP-SMX (1.71), ampicillin-sulbactam (1.05),
nitrofurantoin (1.02), fosfomycin (0.93), and amikacin (0.53).
The most commonly isolated pathogen was 
Escherichia coli
, which was detected in 35 (71%) isolates. Other
bacteria commonly found were 
Proteus 
spp in five (12%) isolates, 
Klebsiella
 spp in two (5%) isolates, and
Enterococcus 
in five (12%) isolates.
Conclusion
The findings revealed that out of 10 antibiotics, nitrite-positive groups demonstrated higher resistance only
against ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and doxycycline. Other antibiotics showed no statistically
significant differences in resistance. Furthermore, the highest relative resistance rate was recorded against
cefuroxime, whereas amikacin revealed the lowest. Therefore, we suggest physicians to not adjust antibiotic
therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) based on the presence of nitrite. Urine bacteriology should be
ordered.

**Article:** Lower Urinary Tract Inflammation and Infection: Key Microbiological and Immunological Aspects (2024)
**Journal:** Journal of Clinical Medicine
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.549

This review examines microbiological and immunological aspects of lower urinary tract inflammation and infection. The urinary tract is characterized by a protective mucosal membrane and mucus layer. Mucus production is a normal defense mechanism of the urinary epithelium. Increased mucus in urine sediment can result from inflammatory responses to infection, mechanical irritation, or contamination from vaginal secretions in women. The clinical significance depends on accompanying findings such as white blood cells, bacteria, and clinical symptoms.

saltos abruptos (ex: de 2.5 para 4 ou 5 em dois meses) exigem investigação, mesmo dentro da faixa de normalidade.
**O diagnóstico e manejo da Hiperplasia Prostática Benigna (HPB) dependem mais dos sintomas obstrutivos, como resíduo pós-miccional acima de 40 ml, do que do tamanho da próstata, que pode variar de 25 a mais de 80 gramas sem necessariamente causar problemas.**
- A HPB é comum a partir dos 45-50 anos, mas o tamanho da próstata (normalmente 25-30 gramas) não se correlaciona diretamente com a obstrução; próstatas de 28-29 gramas podem ser obstrutivas, enquanto outras de 70-80 gramas não.
- Um indicador chave de obstrução é o resíduo pós-miccional, com volumes acima de 40 ml sendo anormais, e a urofluxometria, onde um fluxo máximo (Qmax) abaixo de 10 ml/s é considerado alterado (normal > 15 ml/s).
- O tratamento medicamentoso para HPB inclui doses como 0,4 mg de Tansulosina ou 2 a 4 mg de Doxazosina para relaxar a musculatura e melhorar o fluxo urinário.

Besides, auto-mated urine sediment analyzers detect isomorphic RBCs well but may not be good at detecting dysmorphic  RBCs8,28,29.e UF-1000i urine analyzer counts RBCs by ow cytometry, whereas the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer identies RBCs by the analysis of digital images of the urine sediment. ough the two urine sediment analyzers counted fewer RBCs in patients with glomerular disease than in patients with bladder cancer for each positive dipstick blood test, the dierences in RBC numbers between patients with bladder cancer and patients with glomerular disease were greater with the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer than with the UF-1000i urine analyzer. is may be in part because the Cobas 6500 urine analyzer tended to count fewer RBCs in the concentrated urine of patients with glomerular disease.

**Article:** Diagnostic Utility of Urine Microscopy in Kidney Diseases (2024)
**Journal:** Indian Journal of Nephrology
**Section:** abstract | **Similarity:** 0.543

Urine sediment analysis is a highly valuable yet underutilized test in contemporary medicine. Microscopic examination represents a simple, cost-effective, and powerful diagnostic tool for nephrologists, particularly beneficial in acute kidney injury contexts. The review discusses how timely sediment analysis enables compartmental AKI diagnosis and prognostic guidance. A key concern raised is that automated systems fail identifying pathological casts, crystals, and dysmorphic red blood cells, necessitating renewed focus on manual microscopic analysis for accurate identification of renal tubular epithelial cells and other critical urinary particles.

have more advantages for the follow-up of hematuria in cases of glomerular disease, as the results can be positive due to dysmorphic RBCs as well as isomorphic RBCs; further, hematuria can be detected in dilute urine specimens by the presence of heme released from lysed  RBCs27.is study has some limitations. First, automated urinary sediment examination was not compared with the manual microscopic examination, which is recommended in the evaluation of urine sediments in patients with glomerular disease. e latter, however, should be performed by experts under standard conditions and is not feasible where a large number of samples need to be processed quickly. Furthermore, RBC counting under the manual microscopic examination is also not accurate and is subject to wide interobserver  variability35. Second, the dipstick blood test may also give false positives and false negatives. Bacterial peroxidase, for example, can produce false-positive  results36.

Antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally, making infections more difficult to treat, and is related to
increased mortality, morbidity, and cost 
[13,14]
. A growing proportion of community-acquired
uncomplicated UTIs is caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. As a result, empirical therapy is
more likely to fail. Because there are no oral treatment alternatives, an increasing number of individuals
with uncomplicated UTIs require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.
Nitrite tests look for the metabolites of nitrite reductase, an enzyme generated by a variety of
microorganisms. Unless there is a UTI, these compounds are not generally present. This test has a sensitivity
and specificity of 25% and 94%-100%, respectively. The limited sensitivity has been linked to infection
caused by enzyme-deficient bacteria or low-grade bacteriuria.
