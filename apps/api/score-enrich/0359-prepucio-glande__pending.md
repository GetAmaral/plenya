e foreskin. A diagnosis of balanitis has been shown to be more likely in uncir-cumcised patients than in those who are circumcised.18 The condition often occurs secondary to poor hygiene, and treatment consists of cleansing and application ofantibacterial ointment (level 3).5 Recurrent episodes of balanoposthitis is an indication for urologic consultation as it can lead to scarring and pathologic phimosis.5  Paraphimosis:
 
Paraphimosis is a condition where the 
foreskin, once retracted behind the glans of the penis, becomes trapped and cannot be pulled back to its origi-nal position. This results in swelling and constriction of the foreskin behind the glans, leading to potential complications such as impaired blood circulation, pain, and inﬂammation. Paraphimosis is considered a medi-cal emergency and prompt intervention is necessary to alleviate the condition.

Objective
 
To highlight the escalating need for enhanced education on foreskin care among patients and health care providers, particularly as neonatal circumcision rates decline. 
Sources of information
 
This review is based on ﬁndings from a MEDLINE database search of the literature on care of the penile foreskin, foreskin complications, and their management. Articles were reviewed for relevance and quality of evidence was provided with the level of evidence in parentheses throughout the review. When available, evidence from systematic reviews, relevant clinical guidelines, and randomized controlled trials were incorporated. In the absence of high-level evidence, expert opinion on the topic was provided.
Main message
 
As neonatal circumcision rates decline, the importance of educating patients on proper foreskin care becomes increasingly vital to avoid 
complications later in life. This review highlights the role of primary care providers as crucial resources for patient education. Based on the available evidence, the following are reviewed: rates of circumcision in Canada and 
current circumcision practices; recommendations for routine foreskin care; and common preputial complications including urinary tract infections, pathologic phimosis, balanoposthitis, penile lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans), and penile cancer.
Conclusion
 
This review explored current trends and practices in circumcision, routine foreskin care, and common complications seen in uncircumcised 
patients. There is a need for education that extends to allied health professionals working with patients in health care facilities. Primary care 
providers have an important role in facilitating education for patients  and providing recommendations on proper penile hygiene.Editors key points Foreskin care education begins in childhood, with gentle retraction and cleansing of the foreskin with water. Soap and hygiene products can irritate the foreskin and urethral meatus, so washing with water only is advised. The foreskin should always be reduced to cover the glans after cleaning and drying. Proper care continues across the lifespan, as regular retraction of the foreskin reduces smegma accumulation, inﬂammation, pathologic phimosis, and adhesions. Most cases of physiologic phimosis will resolve without any intervention. Counselling by primary care physicians should focus on avoidance of traumatic retraction, proper hygiene techniques, and pathologic signs requiring intervention. Providers can offer a course of topical corticosteroids for bothersome physiologic phimosis as ﬁrst-line therapy. Patients whose symptoms do not respond may be offered a second cycle of therapy.  Penile hygiene is especially important in health care settings where patients may be unable to perform care for themselves. Health care professionals in these facilities should ensure the foreskin is returned to its anatomic position after cleaning to prevent paraphimosis. For patients with catheters, smegma 
removal at the urethral meatus is necessary to prevent bacterial ascension. Physicians should 
advocate for routine penile hygiene practices in these settings to prevent complications.
Routine neonatal circumcision rates are declining in North America.1-4 There is a deficit in general knowledge and consensus on recom-mendations for routine foreskin care among practitioners. Much of the available data focus on care of the foreskin in early childhood. Given this trend, there is a rising need for education on routine foreskin care from primary care providers across a patients lifespan. In this review, we aim to investigate current trends in circumcision, provide recommendations on best practices for foreskin care, and explore potential foreskin complications in later life (Box 1).Sources of informationThis review is based on ﬁndings from a MEDLINE database search of the lit-erature on care of the penile foreskin, foreskin complications, and their man-agement. Articles were reviewed for relevance and quality of evidence is provided with the level of evidence in parentheses (Box 2). When available, we incorporated evidence from systematic reviews, relevant clinical guide-lines, and randomized controlled trials. In the absence of high-level evidence, expert opinion on the topic is provided.

ting have been shown to be physiologic upon urologic review, with only 14.4% proceeding to circumcision.30 Referrals often cite ballooning of the foreskin, which can be alarming for patients. However, ballooning is a harmless phenom-enon and is not associated with obstructed voiding; it is not necessarily a sign of pathologic phimosis or an indi-cation for circumcision if it is the sole concern (level 2).4,31 Penile lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans) and penile cancer: Penile lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition involving the glans and foreskin.28 It can lead to scarring of the preputial ring and pathologic phimosis.32 The exact cause is unclear and may involve history of traumatic injury or an auto-immune process.28 Penile lichen sclerosus is a risk factor for penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and urethral stricture disease.

factor for penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and urethral stricture disease. Penile SCC itself is rare in North America, with risk factors including tobacco use, chronic inﬂammation, balanitis, penile lichen sclerosus, phimo-sis, poor hygiene, absence of childhood circumcision, and sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV infec-tion.33 This further underscores the need for adequate penile hygiene and care. Studies have identified pre-existing penile lichen sclerosus in 28% to 50% of cases of penile SCC.34-37 The average time for cancer to develop after the onset of lichen sclerosus is 10 to 34 years, and we recommend patients be counselled to perform regu-lar self-examinations (level 3).28,32  Balanoposthitis:

role for topi-cal corticosteroids if there is delayed retraction of the foreskin beyond 8 to 10 years of age.3 Topical cortico-steroids thin the preputial skin and obliterate the stra-tum corneum, allowing gentle retraction over time, and are considered effective ﬁrst-line treatment for physi-ologic phimosis (level 1).3 A recent Cochrane review of 14 randomized controlled trials (1459 patients up to 18 years of age) found that topical corticosteroids, compared with placebo or no treatment, may increase the frequency of complete and partial retraction of the foreskin after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment.24 In addition, topical corticosteroids may also increase the probabil-ity of long-term resolution of phimosis at 6 or more months after treatment.24 The most common corticoste-roids used in the randomized trials were betamethasone and clobetasol propionate.24 Penile lichen sclerosus, or balanitis xerotica obliterans, is typically resistant to topical steroid therapy, and referral for derm

ed adult men, uncircumcised men were found to be less likely to regularly wash the whole penis including retracting the foreskin.18 This ﬁnding is supported within our own practices, where many uncircumcised adults are unaware or uninformed about how to properly care for their foreskin. Inferior penile hygiene behaviour has been associated with increased risk of foreskin compli-cations such as balanitis.18 Foreskin care should begin at birth, with regular genital hygiene. When the fore-skin is retractable, the child can be taught to gently retract and clean it with water. Once dried, the fore-skin should always be reduced back to cover the glans (level 3).3,5,19,20 Soap and hygiene products can irritate the foreskin and urethral meatus.21 Counselling patients that gently retracting the foreskin and rinsing with a stream of water in the shower or rinsing while the penis is immersed in a bath is all that is necessary.  Continuing proper hygiene habits into adulthood is crucial.

Foreskin care.
 
For patients presenting with foreskin concerns, proper physical examination by physicians is important. Ask the patient to retract the foreskin them-selves if able. Smegma may be noted under the foreskin. Normal foreskin has no evidence of pale scarring at the preputial outlet. Examine the glans penis under the fore-skin and note the location of the urethral meatus. If the foreskin cannot be retracted, it should never be forced, so as to avoid microtears at the preputial oriﬁce. (Patient encounters for foreskin concerns provide an excellent 
opportunity to discuss foreskin care.) Table . Incidence of physiologic phimosis by age

er care continues across the lifespan, as regular retraction of the foreskin reduces smegma accumulation, inﬂammation, pathologic phimosis, and adhesions. Most cases of physiologic phimosis will resolve without any intervention. Counselling by primary care physicians should focus on avoidance of traumatic retraction, proper hygiene techniques, and pathologic signs requiring intervention. Providers can offer a course of topical corticosteroids for bothersome physiologic phimosis as ﬁrst-line therapy. Patients whose symptoms do not respond may be offered a second cycle of therapy.  Penile hygiene is especially important in health care settings where patients may be unable to perform care for themselves. Health care professionals in these facilities should ensure the foreskin is returned to its anatomic position after cleaning to prevent paraphimosis. For patients with catheters, smegma 
removal at the urethral meatus is necessary to prevent bacterial ascension.

Abstract 
Objective
 
To highlight the escalating need for enhanced education on foreskin care among patients and health care providers, particularly as neonatal circumcision rates decline. 
Sources of information
 
This review is based on ﬁndings from a MEDLINE database search of the literature on care of the penile foreskin, foreskin complications, and their management. Articles were reviewed for relevance and quality of evidence was provided with the level of evidence in parentheses throughout the review. When available, evidence from systematic reviews, relevant clinical guidelines, and randomized controlled trials were incorporated. In the absence of high-level evidence, expert opinion on the topic was provided.

accompanied by dysuria. Clinically, porcelain-like whitish sclerotic 
scarring on the distal portion of prepuce is usually observed (

). is 
scarring leads to phimosis in previously retractable foreskin, or 
adhesions of the foreskin to glans penis (

) (

). In addition to 
preputial lesions, involvement of perifrenular region of glans is oen 
seen, causing sclerotic frenulum breve (
Figure2D
). In some cases, 
erosions, ulcers and even bullous lesions may bepresent. In around 17% 
of patients, external meatus urethrae can also beinvolved, which is oen 
accompanied by dysuria and poor urinary stream. Sometimes meatal 
stenosis can appear years aer the initial manifestation of LS, without 
any signs of persistent or recurrent LS (

circumcision for UTI prevention (level 3).3 Pathologic phimosis:
 
Pathologic phimosis and 
acquired phimosis are synonymous terms referring to the inability to retract the foreskin over the glans of the penis due to a tight or narrow preputial opening that develops from a secondary cause (Figure 1).

al emergency and prompt intervention is necessary to alleviate the condition. Most cases can be reduced manually by applying steady pressure to the glans and constricted skin to alleviate edema, followed by using the thumbs to forcefully push the glans while the ﬁn-gers pull the foreskin over the glans.5 If this is unsuc-cessful, a circumcision or dorsal slit procedure may be required for reduction of the foreskin. Patients should becounselled to always return the foreskin to its ana-tomic position covering the glans after retraction to pre-vent paraphimosis (level 3). Those who have recurrent episodes of paraphimosis should be referred to a urol-ogist for consideration of circumcision as a deﬁnitive treatment option (level 3).
Foreskin care in special populations.
 
Penile hygiene is a health priority over the entire lifespan of a patient.

oreskin and rinsing with a stream of water in the shower or rinsing while the penis is immersed in a bath is all that is necessary.  Continuing proper hygiene habits into adulthood is crucial. Regular retraction of the foreskin should be inte-grated into the long-term hygiene practices of uncircum-cised patients, as it has been associated with reduced smegma accumulation, inflammation, pathologic phi-mosis, and adhesions (level 2).22 In a cohort study of  48 patients in the United States (age range 2 weeks to  52 years), it was found that cleansing the glans a mini-mum of 2 to 3 times per week with gentle retraction of the foreskin can decrease the incidence of common foreskin conditions such as phimosis.23 Additionally, patients who washed while retracting the foreskin were less likely to have adhesions or phimosis than those who did not.
