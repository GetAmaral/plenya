**Primary Unit:** ng/mL | **Conversion:** 1 nmol/L = 7.65 ng/mL | 1 ng/mL = 0.131 nmol/L

**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Literature Review Period:** 2022-2025

## Executive Summary

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED** (Confirmed)

IGF-1 exhibits a robust U-shaped relationship with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer risk. Both very low and very high levels increase mortality risk, with an optimal "Goldilocks zone" in the middle range.

**Key Finding:** The lowest mortality occurs in the **120-160 ng/mL range** across all adult age groups, with risk increasing symmetrically in both directions.

### Critical Age-Dependency

IGF-1 levels decline progressively with age:
- **Peak:** Late teens to early 20s (200-350 ng/mL)
- **Decline:** Most prominent between ages 21-50 (approximately 40-50% reduction)
- **Elderly:** Ages 70+ typically show levels 50-70% lower than young adults
- **Optimal ranges MUST be age-adjusted** for accurate risk stratification

- **Context-dependent interpretation:** Consider symptoms, body composition, exercise level
- **Functional targets:** Upper half of age-specific range for anabolic benefits
- **Low threshold concern:** ~70-80 ng/mL or lower (frailty/sarcopenia risk)
- **High threshold concern:** >175-200 ng/mL (cancer risk consideration)

---

## 4. Health Outcomes by IGF-1 Level

### Very Low IGF-1 (<80 ng/mL) - Risks

**Frailty & Sarcopenia:**
- **Source:** Multiple observational studies (2024 meta-analysis, Frontiers Public Health)
- **Robust association** between low IGF-1 and sarcopenia, poor muscle strength, physical performance
- **Age-dependent decline** promotes loss of muscle mass and strength
- **Gender-specific:** Particularly concerning in women for frailty/low muscle mass

**Cognitive Decline:**
- **Lower IGF-1** associated with cognitive impairment in elderly
- **Exception:** In females with exceptional longevity (90+), lower IGF-1 correlated with BETTER cognition (paradox)

**Cardiovascular & Metabolic:**
- **Increased CVD risk** in general population
- **Association with diabetes mellitus** and metabolic syndrome

**Mortality:**
- **Low IGF-1 (<80 ng/mL):** 33% increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.33)
- **Particularly detrimental after age 75**

### Optimal Range (100-180 ng/mL, Peak 120-160 ng/mL)

**Longevity Sweet Spot:**
- **Lowest all-cause mortality**
- **Lowest cancer mortality**
- **Lowest CVD mortality**
- **Best balance** between anabolic benefits and cancer risk

**Functional Benefits:**
- **Adequate muscle maintenance** without excessive cancer signaling
- **Cognitive function support** (in middle-aged adults)
- **Metabolic health optimization**
- **Physical performance preservation**

### High IGF-1 (>175-200 ng/mL) - Risks

**Cancer Risk - Major Concern:**

**Source:** Multiple prospective cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study, Physicians' Health Study)

**Specific Thresholds:**
- **Breast Cancer (Premenopausal Women):** Risk increases above **207 ng/mL**
- **Prostate Cancer (Men):** Risk increases above **185 ng/mL**

**Risk Magnitudes per 100 ng/mL increase:**
- **Colorectal Cancer:** 69% increase
- **Prostate Cancer:** 49% increase
- **Breast Cancer:** 65% increase
- **Lung Cancer:** 106% increase

**EPIC-Heidelberg Study (2023):**
- **Breast Cancer:** HR 1.25 (95% CI: 1.06-1.47) for higher IGF-1
- **Prostate Cancer:** HR 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09-1.57) for higher IGF-1

**CVD Risk:**
- **In elderly men (avg age 75):** IGF-1 ~190 ng/mL associated with increased CVD events

**Mortality:**
- **High IGF-1:** 23% increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.23)

### Very High IGF-1 (>200-250 ng/mL by age)

**Context-Dependent:**
- **In young adults (20s-30s):** May be physiologically normal
- **In adults 40+:** Significant concern for cancer promotion, metabolic dysfunction
- **In adults 60+:** Strong cancer risk signal, warrants investigation

## 5. Risk Stratification Levels (Age-Adjusted)

### Risk Level Definitions

We propose **6 risk levels** with age-specific thresholds to account for natural decline:

1. **Critical Low** - Severe frailty/sarcopenia risk
2. **Low** - Suboptimal, increased mortality
3. **Low-Optimal** - Lower end of optimal range
4. **Optimal** - Sweet spot for longevity
5. **High-Optimal** - Upper end of safe range
6. **High Risk** - Cancer/mortality risk elevation

---

## 6. Age-Specific Risk Stratification Tables

### Ages 20-30 (Young Adults)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | nmol/L | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <60 | <7.8 | GH deficiency, malnutrition, chronic disease. Assess: eating disorders, malabsorption, pituitary dysfunction |
| **Low** | 60-99 | 7.8-13.0 | Below optimal. Risk: fatigue, poor recovery, suboptimal body composition. Consider: protein intake, sleep, stress |
| **Low-Optimal** | 100-139 | 13.1-18.2 | Lower optimal range. Functional but could be higher for athletic performance |
| **Optimal** | 140-180 | 18.3-23.6 | **SWEET SPOT** - Best balance for longevity, muscle maintenance, low cancer risk |
| **High-Optimal** | 181-220 | 23.7-28.8 | Upper safe range. Monitor trend. Acceptable if stable and asymptomatic |
| **High Risk** | >220 | >28.8 | Cancer risk consideration. Evaluate: acromegaly, exogenous GH, IGF-1 supplementation, very high animal protein diet |

**Median Population:** ~200-250 ng/mL (naturally higher in this age group)

---

### Ages 31-50 (Middle-Aged Adults)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | nmol/L | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <50 | <6.5 | Severe deficiency. High frailty risk. Assess: chronic disease, malnutrition, pituitary pathology |
| **Low** | 50-89 | 6.5-11.7 | Suboptimal. Risk: sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, fatigue, cognitive decline |
| **Low-Optimal** | 90-119 | 11.8-15.6 | Lower optimal range. May benefit from optimization (exercise, nutrition, sleep) |
| **Optimal** | 120-160 | 15.7-20.9 | **SWEET SPOT** - Lowest mortality risk, best longevity profile |
| **High-Optimal** | 161-190 | 21.0-24.9 | Upper safe range. Monitor for trends. May reflect good metabolic health OR early concern |
| **High Risk** | >190 | >24.9 | Cancer risk threshold approached. Evaluate: diet (high animal protein), insulin resistance, exogenous factors |

**Median Population:** ~150-200 ng/mL

---

### Ages 51-70 (Older Adults)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | nmol/L | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <40 | <5.2 | Severe deficiency. High risk: frailty, falls, fractures, cognitive decline |
| **Low** | 40-79 | 5.2-10.3 | Suboptimal. Increased mortality. Assess: sarcopenia, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease |
| **Low-Optimal** | 80-119 | 10.4-15.6 | Lower optimal range. Consider optimization strategies (resistance training, protein, DHEA if appropriate) |
| **Optimal** | 120-160 | 15.7-20.9 | **SWEET SPOT** - Best balance for healthy aging, preserved muscle, low cancer/CVD risk |
| **High-Optimal** | 161-175 | 21.0-22.9 | Upper safe range. Monitor closely given age-related cancer risk |
| **High Risk** | >175 | >22.9 | Significant cancer risk (prostate >185, breast >175). Warrants investigation: exogenous GH, tumors |

**Median Population:** ~90-150 ng/mL

---

### Ages 70+ (Elderly/Longevity Population)

| Risk Level | Range (ng/mL) | nmol/L | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Critical Low** | <30 | <3.9 | Severe frailty risk. Immediate sarcopenia/falls prevention. May need GH evaluation if symptomatic |
| **Low** | 30-69 | 3.9-9.0 | Suboptimal but common in elderly. Risk: accelerated muscle loss, frailty, mortality |
| **Low-Optimal** | 70-99 | 9.1-13.0 | Lower optimal range for age. Functional support crucial (exercise, protein, vitamin D) |
| **Optimal** | 100-150 | 13.1-19.6 | **SWEET SPOT** - Best for healthy aging. Exceptional if achieved naturally |
| **High-Optimal** | 151-170 | 19.7-22.2 | Upper range. Uncommon in healthy elderly. Monitor for trends |
| **High Risk** | >170 | >22.2 | Unusual in this age. High cancer concern. Rule out: exogenous GH, IGF-1 producing tumors |

**Special Note:** IGF-1 <80 ng/mL may be detrimental after age 75 (increased mortality), but context matters. In centenarians, lower IGF-1 may paradoxically correlate with longevity (hormesis effect).

**Median Population:** ~60-100 ng/mL

---

## 7. Special Populations & Considerations

### Centenarians & Exceptional Longevity (90+ years)

**Paradoxical Finding:**
- **Females with exceptional longevity:** IGF-1 ≤96 ng/mL associated with LONGER survival
- **Cancer history:** Lower IGF-1 predicted longer survival in both sexes
- **Possible mechanism:** Reduced IGF-1 signaling may enhance stress resistance and reduce cancer promotion in very elderly

**Interpretation:** The optimal IGF-1 may shift downward in advanced age, potentially representing evolutionary trade-off (reproduction/growth vs. longevity).

### Athletes & High Performers

**Context:** Athletes may naturally have higher IGF-1 due to:
- Intense resistance training (stimulates GH/IGF-1 axis)
- High protein intake
- Optimal sleep and recovery

**Guidance:**
- **Target:** Upper-optimal range (160-180 ng/mL for age)
- **Avoid:** >200 ng/mL even in athletes (cancer risk not justified by performance)
- **Monitor:** Longitudinal trends more important than single value

### Metabolic Syndrome & Insulin Resistance

**Bidirectional Relationship:**
- **High IGF-1 + High Insulin:** May indicate insulin resistance, high refined carb diet, obesity risk
- **Low IGF-1 + High Insulin:** Paradoxically seen in metabolic syndrome (IGF-1 resistance?)

**Guidance:**
- Interpret IGF-1 alongside: fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, lipids
- Elevated IGF-1 (>201 ng/mL) + metabolic dysfunction: prioritize dietary intervention (reduce refined carbs, animal protein)

---

## 8. Clinical Interpretation Guidelines

### When IGF-1 is Low (<80-100 ng/mL)

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. **Physiologic:** Aging, malnutrition, low protein intake
2. **Pathologic:** GH deficiency (pituitary), liver disease (IGF-1 produced in liver), chronic illness, inflammatory conditions
3. **Lifestyle:** Caloric restriction, vegan diet (low protein), excessive endurance exercise, poor sleep

**Functional Medicine Approach:**
- **Optimize protein intake:** 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight
- **Resistance training:** 3-4x/week to stimulate GH/IGF-1
- **Sleep optimization:** 7-9 hours, deep sleep critical for GH pulsatility
- **Stress management:** Chronic cortisol suppresses GH/IGF-1
- **Consider:** Zinc, magnesium, vitamin D optimization
- **Rule out:** Thyroid dysfunction, celiac disease (malabsorption)

**When to Refer Endocrinology:**
- IGF-1 <40 ng/mL at any age
- Symptomatic GH deficiency: severe fatigue, poor recovery, loss of muscle despite training
- IGF-1 disproportionately low for age

### When IGF-1 is High (>175-200 ng/mL in adults 40+)

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. **Physiologic:** Very high animal protein diet, intense training (if young)
2. **Pathologic:** Acromegaly (GH excess - pituitary adenoma), IGF-1 secreting tumor (rare)
3. **Exogenous:** GH supplementation, IGF-1 supplementation, anabolic steroids (can increase IGF-1)

**Functional Medicine Approach:**
- **Dietary modification:** Reduce animal protein (especially red meat, dairy), increase plant protein
- **Cancer screening:** Age-appropriate (mammogram, PSA, colonoscopy)
- **Monitor trend:** Recheck in 3-6 months
- **Assess insulin resistance:** Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c

**When to Refer Endocrinology:**
- IGF-1 >250 ng/mL in adults 40+
- IGF-1 >300 ng/mL at any adult age
- Signs/symptoms of acromegaly: enlarged hands/feet, jaw, frontal bossing, joint pain, carpal tunnel, sleep apnea
- Rule out: Pituitary MRI, GH suppression test

---

## 9. Optimization Strategies (Functional Medicine)

### To INCREASE Low IGF-1 (Safely)

**Nutritional:**
- **Protein:** 1.2-1.6 g/kg/day (high-quality sources)
- **Leucine-rich foods:** Eggs, chicken, fish, Greek yogurt (if tolerated)
- **Zinc:** 15-30 mg/day (oysters, beef, pumpkin seeds)
- **Magnesium:** 400-600 mg/day (leafy greens, nuts, dark chocolate)
- **Vitamin D:** Optimize to 40-60 ng/mL (25-OH vitamin D)

**Lifestyle:**
- **Resistance training:** 3-5x/week, compound movements (squats, deadlifts, presses)
- **High-intensity interval training (HIIT):** 2-3x/week (stimulates GH pulse)
- **Sleep optimization:** 7-9 hours, prioritize deep sleep (GH released during slow-wave sleep)
- **Intermittent fasting (cautiously):** May transiently increase GH, but prolonged fasting can lower IGF-1

**Supplements (Evidence-Based):**
- **Colostrum:** May increase IGF-1 modestly (20-50 ng/mL)
- **Collagen peptides:** With resistance training
- **DHEA:** In elderly with low DHEA-S (may modestly increase IGF-1)
- **Creatine:** Indirect support of muscle mass/strength

**Avoid:**
- Exogenous GH (prescription only, cancer risk)
- IGF-1 injections (not FDA approved for anti-aging, significant cancer concern)

### To DECREASE High IGF-1 (Cancer Risk Reduction)

**Nutritional:**
- **Reduce animal protein:** Especially red meat, dairy (strong IGF-1 stimulators)
- **Increase plant protein:** Legumes, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds
- **Caloric restriction:** Modest (not severe) - lowers IGF-1 and insulin
- **Reduce refined carbohydrates:** Lower insulin, which stimulates IGF-1
- **Cruciferous vegetables:** May have anti-IGF-1 effects (broccoli, cauliflower, kale)

**Lifestyle:**
- **Reduce excessive resistance training volume:** If very high volume bodybuilding
- **Moderate exercise:** Maintain muscle without excessive GH stimulation
- **Weight management:** Obesity increases IGF-1 and insulin

**Supplements (Potential):**
- **Green tea (EGCG):** May modestly reduce IGF-1
- **Curcumin:** Anti-inflammatory, may affect IGF-1 signaling
- **Berberine:** Improves insulin sensitivity, may lower IGF-1 in insulin-resistant states

**Medical:**
- If acromegaly or exogenous GH: discontinue or treat underlying cause
- Cancer surveillance: Especially if family history and IGF-1 >200 ng/mL

---

## 10. Integration with Other Biomarkers

### IGF-1 / IGFBP-3 Ratio

**IGFBP-3** (IGF Binding Protein 3) binds ~90% of circulating IGF-1, modulating bioavailability.

**Ratio Interpretation:**
- **High Ratio (high IGF-1, low IGFBP-3):** More free/bioactive IGF-1, potentially higher cancer risk
- **Low Ratio (low IGF-1, high IGFBP-3):** Less bioactive IGF-1
- **Optimal:** Balanced ratio (~0.3-0.4)

**Functional Medicine:** Often measure both IGF-1 AND IGFBP-3 for nuanced assessment.

### IGF-1 + Insulin + HOMA-IR

**Metabolic Context:**
- **High IGF-1 + High Insulin + High HOMA-IR:** Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, high cancer risk
- **Low IGF-1 + High Insulin:** IGF-1 resistance, severe metabolic dysfunction
- **Optimal:** IGF-1 in optimal range + fasting insulin <5 µU/mL + HOMA-IR <1.0

### IGF-1 + Growth Hormone (GH)

**If IGF-1 is low, consider GH stimulation test:**
- **Low IGF-1 + Low GH response:** True GH deficiency (pituitary)
- **Low IGF-1 + Normal GH:** IGF-1 deficiency (liver dysfunction, malnutrition, GH resistance)

**If IGF-1 is high, consider GH suppression test:**
- **High IGF-1 + Failure to suppress GH:** Acromegaly (pituitary adenoma)

---

## 11. Summary Recommendations

### For Clinicians (Functional Medicine)

1. **Always age-adjust IGF-1 interpretation** - Use age-specific reference and risk tables
2. **Target the "sweet spot" (120-160 ng/mL)** - Lowest mortality across all outcomes
3. **U-shaped curve awareness** - Both low and high are risky, avoid extremes
4. **Cancer vigilance** - Levels >175-185 ng/mL in adults 40+ warrant cancer risk discussion
5. **Frailty prevention** - Levels <70-80 ng/mL require sarcopenia/frailty intervention
6. **Context matters** - Interpret with insulin, IGFBP-3, clinical symptoms, body composition
7. **Lifestyle first** - Nutrition and exercise are primary modulators
8. **Recheck longitudinally** - Single value less important than trend over time

### Risk Stratification Quick Reference

**Critical Low:** <40-60 ng/mL (age-dependent) - Severe frailty/mortality risk
**Low:** 40-99 ng/mL - Suboptimal, increased mortality (HR 1.33)
**Optimal:** 100-180 ng/mL (PEAK 120-160 ng/mL) - Lowest mortality
**High:** 180-200 ng/mL - Approaching cancer risk threshold
**Very High:** >200 ng/mL - Significant cancer risk (HR 1.23 for mortality)

### Key Thresholds

- **<30 ng/mL:** Critical in elderly (severe frailty)
- **<80 ng/mL:** Concern for sarcopenia, cognitive decline, increased mortality
- **100-180 ng/mL:** Optimal range for longevity
- **120-160 ng/mL:** "Goldilocks zone" - absolute lowest mortality
- **>175 ng/mL:** Cancer risk consideration (breast, prostate, colorectal)
- **>185 ng/mL:** Prostate cancer risk threshold (Physicians' Health Study)
- **>207 ng/mL:** Breast cancer risk threshold (Nurses' Health Study)
- **>250 ng/mL:** Investigate for acromegaly or exogenous GH
