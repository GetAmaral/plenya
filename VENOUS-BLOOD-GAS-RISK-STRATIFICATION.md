**Document Created:** 2026-01-18
**Literature Review Period:** 2023-2026
**Focus:** Optimal ranges for longevity, performance, and functional medicine applications

---

## Executive Summary

Venous blood gas analysis provides critical insights into systemic oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base balance. This document synthesizes recent literature (2023-2026) to establish risk stratification frameworks for functional integrative medicine, focusing on optimal ranges for longevity and performance rather than traditional pathological thresholds.

**Key Finding:** Most parameters demonstrate **U-SHAPED** risk curves, where both low and high extremes increase mortality and morbidity risk, with optimal health occurring in a narrow physiological range.

---

## 1. pH VENOSO (Venous Blood pH)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

Both acidosis and alkalosis increase mortality risk. Optimal health occurs in narrow physiological range.

### Optimal Range for Longevity/Performance
- **7.35 - 7.42** (with sweet spot at 7.38-7.40)
- Venous pH is typically 0.02-0.05 units lower than arterial pH

### Reference Interval (2024 Study)
- Healthy adults: **7.29-7.43**
- Clinical reference: 7.30-7.43

### Literature Citations
- Normal body pH ranges 7.35-7.45, average at 7.40 (optimal for blood oxygenation and biological processes)
- Health ABC Study: Deviations from normal acid-base balance associated with increased mortality (HR 1.17 for metabolic acidosis, 1.35 for metabolic alkalosis)
- Severe alkalemia (pH >7.55) associated with significantly increased mortality in ICU patients
- pH >7.60 shows 48.5% mortality rate vs 27.9% for pH >7.48

### Risk Stratification Table

| Risk Level | pH Range | Description | Mortality/Morbidity Risk |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **1 - Critical Low** | <7.20 | Severe acidosis | Very High (life-threatening) |
| **2 - High Risk Low** | 7.20-7.29 | Moderate acidosis | High (HR ~1.24) |
| **3 - Moderate Risk Low** | 7.30-7.34 | Mild acidosis | Moderate |
| **4 - OPTIMAL** | **7.35-7.42** | Physiological range | **Lowest risk** |
| **5 - Moderate Risk High** | 7.43-7.48 | Mild alkalosis | Moderate |
| **6 - High Risk High** | 7.49-7.60 | Moderate alkalosis | High (HR ~1.35, 27.9% mortality) |
| **7 - Critical High** | >7.60 | Severe alkalosis | Very High (48.5% mortality) |

### Unit and Conversion
- **Unit:** pH units (dimensionless)
- **No conversion needed** (universal scale)

## 2. pCO2 VENOSO (Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

Both hypocapnia (low pCO2) and hypercapnia (high pCO2) increase mortality risk, particularly in cardiac arrest and acute illness.

### Optimal Range for Longevity/Performance
- **38-48 mmHg** (venous)
- Target normocapnia: **40-45 mmHg** (arterial equivalent: 35-42 mmHg)
- Venous pCO2 is approximately 4-8 mmHg higher than arterial

### Reference Interval (2024 Study)
- Healthy adults: **35-59 mmHg**

- Female: 34-68 mmHg

### Literature Citations
- U-shaped relationship between pCO2 and hospital mortality post-cardiac arrest (OR 1.37 for hypocapnia, OR 1.42 for hypocapnia vs normocapnia)
- Hypercapnia showed reduced in-hospital mortality compared to normocapnia in some studies (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.92), but severe hypercapnia increases risk
- Current guidelines recommend normocapnia (35-45 mmHg arterial) after cardiac arrest
- Both hypo- and hypercapnia predict mortality in oxygen-dependent COPD

### Risk Stratification Table

| Risk Level | pCO2 Venous (mmHg) | Description | Mortality/Morbidity Risk |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **1 - Critical Low** | <30 | Severe hypocapnia | Very High (OR 1.42 mortality) |

| **3 - Moderate Risk Low** | 35-38 | Mild hypocapnia | Moderate |
| **4 - OPTIMAL** | **38-48** | Physiological normocapnia | **Lowest risk** |
| **5 - Moderate Risk High** | 48-55 | Mild hypercapnia | Moderate (acceptable in some contexts) |
| **6 - High Risk High** | 55-65 | Moderate hypercapnia | High (increased ICU stay, ventilator dependency) |
| **7 - Critical High** | >65 | Severe hypercapnia | Very High (respiratory failure risk) |

### Unit and Conversion

## 3. pO2 VENOSO (Partial Pressure of Oxygen)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR (with threshold)**

Low venous pO2 indicates tissue hypoxia. While extremely high values are uncommon in venous blood, the primary risk is insufficient tissue oxygenation.

### Optimal Range for Longevity/Performance
- **40-50 mmHg** (venous)
- Values >50 mmHg indicate excellent tissue oxygen delivery
- Values <35 mmHg suggest inadequate tissue oxygenation

### Reference Interval (2024 Study)
- Healthy adults: **25-70 mmHg**
- Male: 23-71 mmHg
- Female: 25-78 mmHg

### Literature Citations
- Venous pO2 approximately 60 mmHg lower than arterial after O2 release in capillaries
- Critical mixed venous pO2: value above which O2 consumption is optimal and independent of pO2; below which O2 consumption decreases
- During hypoxemia, venous pO2 may not reflect true tissue PO2 (tissue PO2 can be lower)
- Tissue hypoxia occurs when oxygen delivery fails to meet metabolic demands

### Risk Stratification Table

| Risk Level | pO2 Venous (mmHg) | Description | Tissue Oxygenation Status |
|------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **1 - Critical** | <20 | Severe tissue hypoxia | Critical - inadequate O2 extraction |
| **2 - High Risk** | 20-30 | Moderate tissue hypoxia | High risk - compromised tissue oxygenation |
| **3 - Moderate Risk** | 30-35 | Mild tissue hypoxia | Moderate risk - borderline oxygenation |
| **4 - Acceptable** | 35-40 | Low-normal oxygenation | Acceptable but suboptimal |
| **5 - OPTIMAL** | **40-50** | Optimal tissue oxygenation | **Ideal tissue O2 delivery** |
| **6 - Excellent** | 50-70 | High-normal oxygenation | Excellent tissue perfusion |

### Unit and Conversion
- **Primary Unit:** mmHg (millimeters of mercury)
- **Alternative Unit:** kPa (kilopascals)
- **Conversion:** 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa; 1 kPa = 7.5 mmHg
- **Example:** 40 mmHg = 5.3 kPa

- Bicarbonate <22 mmol/L correlated with malignancy-related mortality
- Bicarbonate >26 mmol/L associated with cardiovascular mortality
- Elevated bicarbonate in CHF patients (>26 mmol/L) signifies enhanced proximal nephron activation, loop diuretic resistance, and adverse outcomes
- High bicarbonate (≥24 mEq/L) associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients

### Risk Stratification Table

| Risk Level | HCO3 (mEq/L) | Description | Mortality/Morbidity Risk |
|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **1 - Critical Low** | <18 | Severe metabolic acidosis | Very High (life-threatening) |
| **2 - High Risk Low** | 18-22 | Moderate acidosis | High (HR 1.24, malignancy mortality) |
| **3 - Moderate Risk Low** | 22-23 | Mild acidosis | Moderate |
| **4 - OPTIMAL** | **24-27** | Physiological optimal | **Lowest mortality risk** |
| **5 - Moderate Risk High** | 27-30 | Mild alkalosis | Moderate |
| **6 - High Risk High** | 30-35 | Moderate alkalosis | High (CV mortality, CHF outcomes) |
| **7 - Critical High** | >35 | Severe metabolic alkalosis | Very High (diuretic resistance, mortality) |

### Unit and Conversion
- **Primary Unit:** mEq/L (milliequivalents per liter)
- **Alternative Unit:** mmol/L (millimoles per liter)
- **Conversion:** 1 mEq/L = 1 mmol/L (for monovalent ions like HCO3-)
- **Units are interchangeable for bicarbonate**

---

## 5. BE (Base Excess)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (with asymmetric risk)**

Negative base excess (base deficit) has stronger mortality association than positive base excess, but both extremes increase risk.

### Optimal Range for Longevity/Performance
- **-2 to +2 mEq/L** (standard physiological range)
- **-1 to +1 mEq/L** (optimal narrow range)
- Values within -3 to +3 mEq/L considered acceptable

### Reference Interval

## 6. SatO2 VENOSA (Venous Oxygen Saturation)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

Both low (<60%) and high (>90%) venous oxygen saturation increase mortality risk. Low values indicate tissue hypoxia; high values may indicate impaired oxygen extraction (dysoxia).

### Optimal Range for Longevity/Performance
- **70-80%** (SvO2 - mixed venous saturation)
- **70-89%** (ScvO2 - central venous saturation, broader range)
- Target >70% recommended by surviving sepsis guidelines

### Reference Interval
- Normal SvO2: **60-80%**
- Typical venous value: ~73%
- Central venous (ScvO2): recommended >70%

### Literature Citations
- ScvO2 <60% at ICU admission: 4.2x higher mortality risk (RR 4.2, 95% CI 2.4-7.2) in cardiac surgery patients (2023)
- ScvO2 <60% associated with 29% mortality vs 17% for ScvO2 >60%
- ScvO2 >80-90% correlated with increased mortality (34% in hyperoxia group vs 21% normoxia)
- Levels >80% suggest impaired oxygen extraction ability (cellular dysoxia)
- Goal ScvO2 >70% or SvO2 >65% recommended for septic and non-septic ICU patients
- Multi-center study: ScvO2 predictor of mortality in sepsis patients

### Risk Stratification Table

| Risk Level | SatO2 Venosa (%) | Description | Mortality/Morbidity Risk |
|------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **1 - Critical Low** | <40 | Severe tissue hypoxia | Very High (shock, organ failure) |
| **2 - High Risk Low** | 40-60 | Moderate tissue hypoxia | High (RR 4.2, 29-40% mortality) |
| **3 - Moderate Risk Low** | 60-70 | Mild tissue hypoxia | Moderate (17% mortality) |
| **4 - OPTIMAL** | **70-80** | Physiological optimal | **Lowest mortality risk (21%)** |
| **5 - Acceptable High** | 80-89 | High-normal saturation | Low risk |
| **6 - High Risk High** | 90-95 | Hyperoxia/impaired extraction | High (34% mortality, dysoxia) |
| **7 - Critical High** | >95 | Severe dysoxia | Very High (inability to extract O2) |

### Unit and Conversion
- **Unit:** % (percentage)
- **No conversion needed**
- **Types:**
  - SvO2: Mixed venous O2 saturation (pulmonary artery catheter)
  - ScvO2: Central venous O2 saturation (central line, easier to obtain)
  - ScvO2 typically 5-7% higher than SvO2

## Clinical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Interpretation Principles
- **Always consider the clinical context** - reference ranges are for healthy adults
- **Look for patterns** - multiple abnormalities suggest systemic issues
- **Trend analysis** - serial measurements more valuable than single values
- **U-shaped curves mean both extremes are harmful** - avoid over-correction

### 2. Functional Medicine Focus
These ranges emphasize:
- **Optimization over pathology** - preventing disease before it manifests
- **Longevity markers** - associations with long-term mortality
- **Performance metrics** - supporting peak physical and cognitive function
- **Individualization** - optimal may vary by age, fitness level, and health status

### 3. Key Relationships
- **pH and HCO3**: Metabolic component of acid-base balance
- **pH and pCO2**: Respiratory component of acid-base balance
- **pO2 and SatO2**: Oxygenation status (oxygen content vs saturation)
- **BE and HCO3**: Both reflect metabolic acid-base status (BE more comprehensive)

### 4. When to Intervene
From functional medicine perspective:
- **Tier 1 (Immediate):** Values in critical ranges (levels 1 or 7)
- **Tier 2 (Urgent):** Values in high-risk ranges (levels 2 or 6)
- **Tier 3 (Optimization):** Values outside optimal range (levels 3 or 5)
- **Tier 4 (Maintenance):** Values in optimal range (level 4) - maintain through lifestyle

### 5. Lifestyle Interventions for Optimization

**For Acidosis (Low pH, Low HCO3, Negative BE):**
- Increase alkaline-forming foods (vegetables, fruits)
- Adequate hydration
- Reduce protein excess
- Address respiratory compensation (breathing exercises)
- Check kidney function

**For Alkalosis (High pH, High HCO3, Positive BE):**
- Address diuretic use
- Check for GI losses (vomiting, NG suction)
- Evaluate electrolyte balance
- Consider respiratory causes (hyperventilation)

**For Hypoxemia (Low pO2, Low SatO2):**
- Optimize cardiovascular fitness
- Address anemia
- Improve lung function
- Consider altitude exposure
- Check for sleep apnea

**For Ventilation Issues (Abnormal pCO2):**
- Breathing retraining
- Address chronic lung disease
- Optimize respiratory muscle strength
- Consider sleep-disordered breathing
- Stress management (for hyperventilation)

## Limitations and Considerations

### Study Limitations
1. **Most literature is from critical care** - less data on healthy optimization
2. **Limited 2025-2026 data** - most references from 2023-2024
3. **Venous vs arterial differences** - some studies use arterial values (adjusted here)
4. **Population heterogeneity** - optimal ranges may differ by age, ethnicity, comorbidities

### Clinical Considerations
1. **Venous blood gas is not arterial** - cannot fully replace ABG for oxygenation assessment
2. **Context matters** - acute vs chronic, compensated vs uncompensated
3. **Individual variation** - some people have adapted to slightly abnormal values
4. **Time of day effects** - circadian rhythms affect some parameters
5. **Sampling technique** - venous stasis, air bubbles affect results

### Functional Medicine Caveats
1. **Optimal ≠ Average** - population means may not represent peak health
2. **Bioindividuality** - optimal for one person may not be optimal for another
3. **Dynamic not static** - health is about homeostatic capacity, not fixed values
4. **Lifestyle context** - athletes, high-altitude residents may have different normals
5. **Age effects** - optimal ranges may shift with healthy aging
