## Clinical Content Summary

### Clinical Relevance (1,927 characters)
Comprehensive explanation of IGF-1 as the primary mediator of growth hormone effects, covering:
- **Physiology:** IGF-1 as GH mediator, stable biomarker without circadian variation
- **Reference Ranges:** 150-450 ng/mL for 20-30 age group (assay-dependent)
- **Age Patterns:** Decline starts after 20 years (30 ng/mL per decade)
- **Low IGF-1:** <2.5th percentile (Z-score <-2) suggests GH deficiency or resistance
- **High IGF-1:** >97.5th percentile indicates GH excess (acromegaly)
- **Multiple Pituitary Deficiencies:** ≥3 deficiencies + low IGF-1 = >97% GHD probability
- **Confounding Factors:** Malnutrition, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic diseases, renal/hepatic failure
- **Gender Differences:** Subtle sexual dimorphism, estrogen modulation effects
- **Treatment Targets:** Mid-to-upper third of reference range for GH replacement
- **Anti-inflammatory Benefits:** Upper-normal IGF-1 associated with lower inflammatory markers

### Patient Explanation (1,801 characters)
Patient-friendly Portuguese explanation covering:
- **What is IGF-1:** Liver-produced protein responding to pituitary GH
- **Function in 20-30 Age Group:** Muscle mass, bone density, fat/glucose metabolism, cardiovascular health
- **Stability Advantage:** Unlike GH, remains stable throughout the day
- **Normal Values:** 150-450 ng/mL (lab-specific)
- **Low IGF-1 Symptoms:** Excessive fatigue, difficulty gaining muscle, increased body fat, lower bone density
- **High IGF-1 Signs:** GH excess from pituitary tumor (acromegaly)
- **Affecting Factors:** Nutrition, diabetes control, chronic liver/kidney disease, medications
- **Interpretation Importance:** Always requires endocrinologist evaluation with complete clinical history

### Conduct (3,306 characters)
Detailed 5-stage clinical protocol:

**STAGE 1 - Test Adequacy Verification:**
- Fasting status (8-12 hours)
- No biotin for 72 hours (assay interference)
- Age and sex-specific reference ranges
- Z-scores/SDS preferred

**STAGE 2 - Normal Values (2.5th-97.5th percentile):**
- Normal GH-IGF-1 axis function
- No further investigation unless symptomatic

**STAGE 3 - Low IGF-1 Investigation (<2.5th percentile):**
- Exclude secondary causes:
  - Nutritional status (albumin, prealbumin)
  - Glycemic control (HbA1c)
  - Hepatic function (transaminases, bilirubin, PT)
  - Renal function (creatinine, GFR)
  - Chronic inflammation (CRP, ESR)
  - Medications (glucocorticoids, oral estrogens)
- Evaluate other pituitary hormones (TSH/T4, cortisol, LH/FSH, prolactin)
- ≥3 pituitary deficits + IGF-1 <-2 SD = >97% GHD probability (no stimulation test needed)
- <2 deficits = GH stimulation test required (ITT, glucagon test, or GHRH+arginine)

**STAGE 4 - Elevated IGF-1 Investigation (>97.5th percentile):**
- Basal GH measurement
- Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for GH suppression
  - 75g glucose oral load
  - GH at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes
  - Failure to suppress GH to <1 ng/mL (ultrasensitive) or <0.4 ng/mL confirms acromegaly
- Pituitary MRI with contrast (identify GH-secreting adenoma)
- Evaluate acromegaly complications:
  - Echocardiogram (ventricular hypertrophy)
  - Colonoscopy (polyps)
  - Polysomnography (sleep apnea)
  - Visual field testing
  - Glucose/OGTT (secondary diabetes)

**STAGE 5 - GH Replacement Monitoring:**
- IGF-1 every 3-6 months initially
- Target: mid-to-upper third of reference range (SDS 0 to +2)
- Upper-normal maintenance associated with:
  - Lower inflammatory markers (hs-CRP)
  - Better body composition
- Periodic assessments:
  - Body composition (DEXA)
  - Lipid profile
  - Glucose
  - GH excess symptoms (arthralgia, edema, headache)

**SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Women on oral estrogen: reduced GH bioavailability
  - Consider transdermal estrogen or increased GH dose
- IGF-1 interpretation has limitations
- Always correlate with clinical presentation and complementary tests

## Recommendations for Clinical Use

1. **Always compare results to lab-specific reference ranges** - IGF-1 values vary significantly between assays (up to 2.5-fold difference)

2. **Use Z-scores/SDS when available** - More accurate than percentiles for clinical decision-making

3. **Consider clinical context** - Multiple factors affect IGF-1 beyond GH status

4. **Screen for secondary causes** - Before confirming GH deficiency with low IGF-1

5. **Multi-hormone assessment** - IGF-1 interpretation improves with pituitary panel

6. **Target upper-normal in GH replacement** - Recent evidence supports anti-inflammatory benefits

7. **Gender-specific considerations** - Oral estrogen affects IGF-1 interpretation in women

8. **Longitudinal monitoring** - Single measurements less informative than trends
