## Conversion Factors

### Cholesterol (Total, HDL, LDL, VLDL, Non-HDL)
- **mg/dL to mmol/L:** Divide by 38.67 (or multiply by 0.02586)
- **mmol/L to mg/dL:** Multiply by 38.67

### Triglycerides
- **mg/dL to mmol/L:** Divide by 88.57 (or multiply by 0.01129)
- **mmol/L to mg/dL:** Multiply by 88.57

---

## 1. TOTAL CHOLESTEROL

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

Multiple large studies confirm a U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol and all-cause mortality. Very low levels (<150 mg/dL) are associated with increased mortality risk from all causes, while very high levels (>280 mg/dL) are significantly associated with CVD mortality.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**210-249 mg/dL (5.4-6.4 mmol/L)** for most adults

**Age and Sex Variations:**
- Men aged 18-34: 180-219 mg/dL (4.7-5.7 mmol/L)
- Women aged 18-34: 160-199 mg/dL (4.1-5.1 mmol/L)
- Women aged 35-44: 180-219 mg/dL (4.7-5.7 mmol/L)
- Adults 75-99: 210-249 mg/dL (5.4-6.4 mmol/L)

### Risk Stratification (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (mg/dL) | Range (mmol/L) | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Very High Risk** | <120 | <3.1 | Strongly predictive of heightened death risk from all causes |
| **High Risk** | 120-159 | 3.1-4.1 | Below optimal; associated with increased mortality |
| **Moderate Risk** | 160-199 | 4.1-5.1 | Acceptable but below optimal for most adults |
| **Optimal** | 200-249 | 5.2-6.4 | Associated with lowest all-cause mortality |
| **Elevated** | 250-279 | 6.5-7.2 | Moderate CVD risk; requires lifestyle intervention |
| **High CVD Risk** | ≥280 | ≥7.2 | Significantly associated with CVD mortality |

### Key Evidence
- Korean study of 12.8 million adults: TC levels of 210-249 mg/dL associated with lowest mortality
- In TC ranges 50-199 mg/dL: each 39 mg/dL increase associated with 23% lower mortality
- In TC ranges 200-449 mg/dL: each 39 mg/dL increase associated with 7% higher mortality
- 2024 Chinese study (oldest old, age 85+): TC 210-249 mg/dL had lowest mortality risk

---

## 2. HDL CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED**

Recent research (2024-2025) demonstrates a U-shaped relationship between HDL-C and mortality. Both low HDL (<40 mg/dL) and very high HDL (>80 mg/dL) are associated with increased mortality risk, challenging the traditional "higher is always better" paradigm.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**50-79 mg/dL (1.3-2.0 mmol/L)** for both men and women

### Risk Stratification (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (mg/dL) | Range (mmol/L) | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Very High Risk** | <30 | <0.8 | Severe deficiency; very high CVD and mortality risk |
| **High Risk** | 30-39 | 0.8-1.0 | Low HDL; increased CVD and all-cause mortality |
| **Moderate Risk** | 40-49 | 1.0-1.3 | Below optimal; moderate CVD risk |
| **Optimal** | 50-79 | 1.3-2.0 | Associated with lowest all-cause mortality |
| **Elevated** | 80-89 | 2.1-2.3 | Paradoxical increased risk begins |
| **Paradoxical High Risk** | ≥90 | ≥2.3 | Very high HDL; HR 1.10 all-cause mortality, 1.09 CVD mortality |

### Key Evidence (2024-2025)
- **U-shaped curve confirmed:** Chinese study of 3.3 million adults found optimal range 50-79 mg/dL
- **Very high HDL risk:** HDL-C >90 mg/dL: HR 1.10 (all-cause mortality), HR 1.09 (CVD mortality), HR 1.11 (cancer mortality)
- **Korean 2025 study:** Both low (<40 mg/dL) and very high (>80 mg/dL) HDL associated with increased mortality in non-diabetic males
- **ILLUMINATE trial:** Torcetrapib raised HDL by 72% but increased CVD risk by 25% and all-cause mortality
- **ACCELERATE trial:** Evacetrapib raised HDL by 132% but failed to reduce CV events and showed adverse effects

### HDL Cholesterol Paradox
Clinicians should be cautious interpreting HDL-C at the highest end of the normal distribution. Focus should broaden to include HDL functionality, not just levels.

---

## 3. LDL CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR** (lower is better)

LDL-C shows a clear linear relationship with cardiovascular risk—lower levels are consistently associated with better outcomes without evidence of a lower safety threshold. 2024-2025 guidelines emphasize "lower for longer is better."

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**<70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L)** for optimal cardiovascular health

**Risk-Based Targets (2024-2025 Guidelines):**
- Low risk: <160 mg/dL (<4.1 mmol/L)
- Moderate risk: <145 mg/dL (<3.8 mmol/L)
- High risk: <130 mg/dL (<3.4 mmol/L)
- Very high risk: <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L)
- Extremely high risk: <55 mg/dL (<1.4 mmol/L)

### Risk Stratification (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (mg/dL) | Range (mmol/L) | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | <70 | <1.8 | Best for cardiovascular health; lowest ASCVD risk |
| **Near Optimal** | 70-99 | 1.8-2.6 | Acceptable for low-risk individuals |
| **Borderline High** | 100-129 | 2.6-3.3 | Elevated risk; lifestyle modifications needed |
| **High** | 130-159 | 3.4-4.1 | High CVD risk; therapy consideration |
| **Very High** | 160-189 | 4.1-4.9 | Very high CVD risk; treatment recommended |
| **Extremely High** | ≥190 | ≥4.9 | Possible familial hypercholesterolemia; aggressive treatment |

### Key Evidence (2024-2025)
- **No lower threshold:** Since no known adverse events linked to very low LDL-C, avoid fear of overtreatment
- **FOURIER-OLE Study:** MACE declined progressively down to <20 mg/dL and even <10 mg/dL (median 7 mg/dL) without increased safety events
- **Linear benefit:** Each 39 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C lowers relative risk of ASCVD by 20-25%
- **Natural evidence:** Patients with total PCSK9 deficiency have LDL-C ~15 mg/dL without adverse effects
- **Cognitive safety:** Very low LDL-C via PCSK9 inhibition and statins not associated with cognitive impairment through long-term follow-up
- **ACS patients (2025 guidelines):** Therapy intensification reasonable if LDL-C 55-69 mg/dL with residual risk factors

### Safety of Very Low LDL-C
Extensive research confirms safety of LDL-C <30 mg/dL and even <20 mg/dL:
- No increased hemorrhagic stroke risk
- No cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's dementia
- Cardiovascular benefit continues log-linearly without plateau

---

## 4. VLDL CHOLESTEROL (VLDL-C)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR** (lower is better)

VLDL particles contain mostly triglycerides and are atherogenic. Higher VLDL increases cardiovascular risk linearly.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**<20 mg/dL (<0.5 mmol/L)**

**Calculation:** VLDL-C = Triglycerides ÷ 5

### Risk Stratification (4 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (mg/dL) | Range (mmol/L) | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | <20 | <0.5 | Best metabolic health; low triglyceride burden |
| **Normal** | 20-29 | 0.5-0.8 | Acceptable range |
| **Borderline High** | 30-39 | 0.8-1.0 | Increased CVD risk; address triglycerides |
| **High Risk** | ≥40 | ≥1.0 | High CVD risk; significant triglyceride elevation |

### Key Evidence
- VLDL and LDL are equally atherogenic (both promote atherosclerosis)
- VLDL is a "triglyceride-rich lipoprotein"
- Lowering triglycerides directly lowers VLDL
- High VLDL (≥30 mg/dL) increases heart disease and stroke risk

---

## 5. TRIGLYCERIDES

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR** (lower is better)

Triglycerides show a linear relationship with cardiovascular risk and are a superior marker compared to LDL-C for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**<70 mg/dL (<0.8 mmol/L)** - ideal for metabolic health
**<100 mg/dL (<1.1 mmol/L)** - acceptable functional medicine range

**Conventional Guidelines:** <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L)

### Risk Stratification (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (mg/dL) | Range (mmol/L) | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | <70 | <0.8 | Best metabolic health; excellent insulin sensitivity |
| **Excellent** | 70-99 | 0.8-1.1 | Very good metabolic health; low insulin resistance |
| **Acceptable** | 100-149 | 1.1-1.7 | Acceptable but not optimal; early insulin resistance possible |
| **Borderline High** | 150-199 | 1.7-2.3 | Increased CVD risk; insulin resistance likely |
| **High** | 200-499 | 2.3-5.6 | High CVD risk; significant insulin resistance |
| **Very High** | ≥500 | ≥5.6 | Pancreatitis risk; emergency intervention needed |

### Key Evidence
- **Functional medicine optimal:** <70 mg/dL for best metabolic health
- **Insulin resistance:** Triglycerides are #1 risk factor for heart disease related to metabolic syndrome
- **Linked conditions:** High triglycerides associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, fatty liver disease
- **Primary prevention goal:** Lower triglycerides to reduce metabolic syndrome and ASCVD risk
- **Pancreatitis threshold:** ≥500 mg/dL primary objective is pancreatitis prevention

---

## 6. TOTAL CHOLESTEROL/HDL RATIO (TC/HDL)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR** (lower is better)

The TC/HDL ratio is a superior predictor of cardiovascular risk compared to looking at total cholesterol or LDL alone. Lower ratios indicate better cardiovascular health.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**<3.0** - ideal
**<3.5** - very good

### Risk Stratification (5 Levels)

| Risk Level | Ratio | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | <3.0 | Ideal cardiovascular health |
| **Excellent** | 3.0-3.5 | Very good; lowest heart attack risk |
| **Acceptable** | 3.5-4.0 | Acceptable; 14% increased risk vs optimal |
| **Borderline High** | 4.0-5.0 | Elevated risk; 46% increased risk vs optimal |
| **High Risk** | >5.0 | High CVD risk; 89% increased risk vs optimal |

### Gender-Specific Targets
- **Men:** Aim for ratio ≤5.0 (ideally <3.5)
- **Women:** Aim for ratio ≤4.0 (ideally <3.0)

### Key Evidence
- Swedish women study: ratio ≤3.5 had lowest heart attack risk
- TC/HDL ratio superior to total cholesterol or LDL alone for risk prediction
- Each increment above 3.5 shows progressive risk increase
- More accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk than individual lipid values

---

## 7. TRIGLYCERIDE/HDL RATIO (TG/HDL)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR** (lower is better)

The TG/HDL ratio is considered the BEST surrogate biomarker for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. It's a superior predictor of cardiovascular disease compared to TC/HDL ratio and provides insight into small dense LDL particles.

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**<1.0** - indicates insulin sensitivity (ideal)
**<2.0** - acceptable functional medicine target

### Risk Stratification (5 Levels)

| Risk Level | Ratio (mg/dL units) | Description |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | <1.0 | Excellent insulin sensitivity; no insulin resistance |
| **Excellent** | 1.0-1.5 | Good metabolic health; low insulin resistance |
| **Acceptable** | 1.5-2.0 | Acceptable; mild insulin resistance possible |
| **Borderline High** | 2.0-3.0 | Insulin resistance likely; increased CVD risk |
| **High Risk** | >3.0 | Significant insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome; high CVD risk |

### Ethnicity and Sex-Specific Cutoffs (2024 Research)
Based on 32 studies involving 49,782 participants:
- **Women:** Average cutoff 2.53 for insulin resistance detection
- **Men:** Average cutoff 2.8 for insulin resistance detection
- **Note:** Accuracy greater for Caucasians, Asians, and Hispanics vs African Americans

### Key Evidence (2024)
- **Best biomarker:** "The real ratio of bad to good cholesterol"
- **TG/HDL superiority:** Best surrogate marker for:
  - Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome
  - Small dense LDL particles
  - Cardiovascular disease risk
- **Better than TC/HDL:** More predictive of heart disease than total cholesterol/HDL ratio
- **NAFLD prediction:** Highly effective parameter in predicting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
- **Cost-effective:** Low-cost laboratory alternative to complex insulin resistance testing (HOMA-IR)
- **Comprehensive meta-analysis:** 2024 review analyzed 20 years of research across diverse ethnic backgrounds

## 8. NON-HDL CHOLESTEROL

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR** (lower is better)

Non-HDL cholesterol represents the cholesterol content of all atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. It's emerged as a better CVD risk predictor than LDL-C, especially in patients with high triglycerides, diabetes, and obesity.

### Calculation
**Non-HDL-C = Total Cholesterol - HDL-C**

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine)
**<100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L)** - optimal for cardiovascular health
**<130 mg/dL (<3.4 mmol/L)** - acceptable (very high risk patients)

**Risk-Based Targets (2025 Guidelines):**
- Low risk: <160 mg/dL (<4.1 mmol/L)
- Moderate risk: <145 mg/dL (<3.8 mmol/L)
- High risk: <130 mg/dL (<3.4 mmol/L)
- Very high risk: <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L)
- Extremely high risk: <85 mg/dL (<2.2 mmol/L)

### Risk Stratification (6 Levels)

| Risk Level | Range (mg/dL) | Range (mmol/L) | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Optimal** | <100 | <2.6 | Best cardiovascular health |
| **Near Optimal** | 100-129 | 2.6-3.3 | Acceptable for low-risk individuals |
| **Borderline High** | 130-159 | 3.4-4.1 | Elevated risk; lifestyle modifications |
| **High** | 160-189 | 4.1-4.9 | High CVD risk; treatment consideration |
| **Very High** | 190-219 | 4.9-5.7 | Very high CVD risk; treatment recommended |
| **Extremely High** | ≥220 | ≥5.7 | Extremely high risk; aggressive treatment |

### Key Evidence (2024-2025)
- **Superior to LDL-C:** Better CVD risk predictor, especially with high TG, diabetes, obesity
- **Secondary target:** Target non-HDL-C after achieving optimal LDL-C
- **Rule of 30:** Treatment target should be 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C target
- **Captures remnant cholesterol:** Includes VLDL-C, IDL-C, LDL-C, and Lp(a)
- **No fasting required:** Can be measured without fasting, unlike LDL-C calculations
- **Treatment intensification:** European guidelines: if LDL-C <135 mg/dL but non-HDL-C ≥166 mg/dL, consider statin therapy for intermediate-risk patients
- **Residual risk:** Higher non-HDL-C strongly correlates with MI and ASCVD even when LDL-C is controlled

---

## ADVANCED LIPID TESTING CONSIDERATIONS (2024 Functional Medicine)

### Beyond Standard Lipid Panel
Functional medicine emphasizes advanced lipid markers for comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment:

1. **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)**
   - Best stratifies cardiovascular risk
   - Recommended as alternative to LDL-C
   - Especially important for hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes
   - Each particle of LDL, VLDL, and IDL contains one ApoB molecule

2. **Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]**
   - Should be measured at least once in every adult's lifetime
   - Elevated Lp(a) associated with increased ASCVD risk
   - Consider in: premature CVD, statin non-responders, borderline intermediate/high risk
   - Used to refine risk stratification and guide aggressive risk factor management

3. **LDL Particle Number and Size**
   - Small dense LDL particles more atherogenic than large buoyant LDL
   - LDL particle number (LDL-P) better predicts CV events than LDL-C
   - Patients with "normal" cholesterol may have high risk depending on particle composition

4. **Triglyceride-Glucose Index (TyG)**
   - Low-cost indicator of insulin resistance
   - TyG <4.49: insulin sensitivity
   - TyG >4.49: insulin resistance
   - Calculation: ln[TG (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2]

### 2024-2025 Risk Stratification Categories
Modern guidelines recognize five risk categories:
1. **Low risk** - Primary prevention
2. **Moderate risk** - Primary prevention
3. **High risk** - Diabetes, CKD, severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL ≥190 mg/dL)
4. **Very high risk** - Established ASCVD
5. **Extremely high risk** - Recurrent ASCVD events, polyvascular disease

## FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE LIPID OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES

### Key Principles (2024-2025 Evidence)

1. **Lower for Longer is Better (LDL-C)**
   - The sooner LDL-lowering therapy starts, the greater the benefit
   - The greater the decrease in LDL-C, the greater the benefit
   - The higher the baseline LDL-C, the greater the benefit
   - The higher the absolute ASCVD risk, the greater the benefit

2. **U-Shaped Curves Matter (Total Cholesterol, HDL-C)**
   - Both very low and very high levels can increase mortality risk
   - Optimal ranges exist rather than "lower is always better"
   - Context matters: age, sex, and overall health status

3. **Ratios Are Superior to Individual Values**
   - TG/HDL ratio: Best insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome marker
   - TC/HDL ratio: Superior CVD risk predictor
   - Consider ratios alongside absolute values

4. **Metabolic Context Is Critical**
   - Triglycerides and TG/HDL ratio reveal insulin resistance
   - Functional medicine targets (<70 mg/dL TG, <1.0 TG/HDL) more aggressive than conventional
   - Address root causes: diet, insulin resistance, inflammation

5. **Personalized Risk Stratification**
   - Consider age, sex, ethnicity for optimal ranges
   - Integrate advanced markers (ApoB, Lp(a), LDL-P)
   - Look beyond LDL-C to non-HDL-C and remnant cholesterol

6. **No Fear of Very Low LDL-C**
   - Extensive evidence supports safety of LDL-C <30 mg/dL
   - No lower threshold for cardiovascular benefit
   - No cognitive, hemorrhagic, or other adverse effects
