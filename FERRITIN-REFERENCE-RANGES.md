# FERRITIN REFERENCE RANGES & RISK STRATIFICATION
## Comprehensive Functional Medicine & Clinical Guidelines (2023-2026)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Ferritin is a critical biomarker for iron status and inflammation. Unlike conventional lab ranges, functional medicine emphasizes optimization within narrower bands to prevent both iron deficiency complications and iron overload-related mortality. **Key principle: Both low and high ferritin correlate with increased mortality (U-shaped curve).**

**Units:** 1 ng/mL = 1 µg/L (equivalent)

## 1. MEN - FERRITIN REFERENCE RANGES

### Conventional Laboratory Ranges
- **Standard Lab Range:** 30–400 ng/mL
- Clinical significance: Broad range designed for disease detection, not optimization

### Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges (2024-2025)

#### OptimalDX Classification (Updated 2024)
| Category | Range (ng/mL) | Clinical Significance |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Low** | < 15 | Absolute iron deficiency; anemia symptoms |
| **Below Optimal** | 15–45 | Iron deficiency risk; 98% sensitivity for IDA |
| **Optimal** | 45–79 | Target range for health & longevity |
| **Above Optimal** | 79–150 | Increased inflammation markers |
| **High** | > 150 | Significant health risks |

#### Alternative Functional Medicine Recommendations
- **Conservative optimal range:** 50–79 ng/mL
- **Research-based optimal:** 70–110 ng/mL (lower mortality, better outcomes)
- **Upper caution threshold:** > 100 ng/mL (associated with increased CVD/diabetes risk)

### Clinical Significance by Level

#### LOW FERRITIN (< 30 ng/mL)
**Symptoms & Consequences:**
- Fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath
- Brain fog, poor concentration, memory issues
- Hair loss, brittle nails
- Pale skin, frequent infections (compromised immunity)
- Restless leg syndrome, anxiety
- Poor exercise tolerance, impaired aerobic capacity
- Impaired T4→T3 conversion (mimics hypothyroidism)
- Reduced TPO enzyme activity (thyroid peroxidase)

**Diagnostic thresholds:**
- < 30 ng/mL: Iron deficiency present
- < 15 ng/mL: Absolute iron deficiency (WHO standard)
- < 50 ng/mL: Clinical correlation needed (functional medicine threshold)

#### HIGH FERRITIN (> 100 ng/mL)
**Symptoms & Consequences:**
- Increased oxidative stress and free radical damage
- Elevated cardiovascular disease risk (age-dependent)
- Elevated type 2 diabetes risk (glucose intolerance)
- Increased cancer risk (as acute phase reactant)
- Joint pain, arthritis (iron accumulation)
- Organ damage (liver, heart, pancreas with severe elevation)
- Testicular dysfunction at very high levels
- Neurodegeneration risk (iron crosses BBB)

**Risk thresholds:**
- > 100 ng/mL: Significantly increased cell damage & disease risk
- > 200 ng/mL: Higher all-cause mortality in general population (Danish study, 23-year follow-up)
- > 500 ng/mL: Iron overload concern; consider hemochromatosis screening
- > 1000 ng/mL: Severe iron overload; high risk for hereditary hemochromatosis

### Risk Stratification for Men

```
DEFICIENT ←――――――――――― OPTIMAL ―――――――――――→ EXCESS
   ↓                      ↓                      ↓

 Anemia               Healthy            Overload/CVD
 Fatigue              Performance        Inflammation
 Impaired T3          Longevity          Mortality↑
```

## 2. WOMEN - FERRITIN REFERENCE RANGES

### Conventional Laboratory Ranges
- **Standard Lab Range:** 10–150 ng/mL
- Women typically lower than men due to menstrual iron loss

### PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (< 50 years, menstruating)

#### Typical Ferritin Levels
- **Median:** 37–42 ng/mL
- **Range:** 12–150 ng/mL (conventional)
- Highly variable based on menstrual flow, dietary iron, supplement use

#### Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges
| Category | Range (ng/mL) | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Low** | < 15 | Absolute iron deficiency |
| **Below Optimal** | 15–40 | Common in heavy periods, vegans |
| **Optimal** | 40–80 | Target for symptom relief & performance |
| **Above Optimal** | 80–150 | Assess for inflammation/other causes |
| **High** | > 150 | Investigate cause; rule out hemochromatosis |

#### Menstruation Impact
- **Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB):** Can cause ferritin loss of 10–20 ng/mL per cycle
- **Iron loss per cycle:** Average 15–30 mg (heavy flow: 50+ mg)
- **Recommendation for HMB:** Target ferritin 50+ ng/mL to maintain stores despite losses
- **Iron needs (premenopausal):** 18 mg/day (vs. 8 mg for men)

#### Premenopausal-Specific Considerations
- Iron deficiency anemia more common in premenopausal women (22.6% prevalence) vs. postmenopausal (5.9%)
- Oral contraceptives may slightly reduce menstrual iron loss
- Consider iron supplementation if ferritin < 40 ng/mL with symptoms

---

### POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (> 50 years or surgical menopause)

#### Typical Ferritin Levels
- **Median:** 71–84 ng/mL
- **Range:** 12–200 ng/mL (conventional)
- **Increase from premenopause:** 2–3 fold increase (median rises from ~40 to ~75 ng/mL)

#### Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges
| Category | Range (ng/mL) | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Low** | < 20 | Investigate cause (GI bleeding? malabsorption?) |
| **Below Optimal** | 20–45 | Still at risk despite loss of menses |
| **Optimal** | 45–80 | Functional target; CVD/metabolic health |
| **Above Optimal** | 80–150 | Assess for inflammation/metabolic syndrome |
| **High** | > 150 | Higher CVD/metabolic risk; investigate |

#### Postmenopausal Changes & Health Implications
- **Why levels rise:** Loss of menstrual iron loss + estrogen decline (affects iron regulation)
- **2024 study findings:** U-shaped relationship with metabolic syndrome; both very low and high ferritin increase metabolic dysfunction risk
- **Estrogen's role:** Estrogen suppresses hepcidin; lower estrogen = higher hepcidin = iron retention
- **Iron needs (postmenopausal):** Drop to 8 mg/day (same as men)
- **CVD risk threshold:** Ferritin > 150–200 ng/mL associated with higher cardiovascular mortality

#### Postmenopausal Screening Recommendations
- Screen for hemochromatosis if ferritin persistently > 150 ng/mL (especially with elevated TSAT)
- Monitor for metabolic syndrome (ferritin is biomarker for insulin resistance)
- Consider iron restriction dietary strategies if ferritin trending upward

---

## 3. CRITICAL CLINICAL CONCEPTS

### Unit Equivalence
- **1 ng/mL = 1 µg/L** (direct equivalence for ferritin; not true for all analytes)
- Both units describe the same measurement; use interchangeably in literature

### U-Shaped Mortality Curve (2016-2024 Evidence)

**Key Finding:** Both low AND high ferritin predict increased mortality risk

#### Study Evidence:
- **2016 Japanese hemodialysis study:** U-shaped relationship observed in patients with low inflammation (CRP < 0.3 mg/dL)
  - **Lowest ferritin group:** HR 1.79 (95% CI 1.18–2.72) for all-cause mortality
  - **Highest ferritin group:** HR 1.55 (95% CI 1.05–2.29) for all-cause mortality

- **Danish population study (23-year follow-up, 8,988 participants):**
  - Ferritin ≥ 200 µg/L: Significantly higher all-cause AND cardiovascular mortality

- **English Longitudinal Study of Aging:**
  - U-shaped relationship between ferritin and cardiovascular/all-cause mortality
  - Association stronger when inflammation low (CRP < 3 mg/L)

#### Clinical Implication
- **Safe zone for longevity:** 50–100 ng/mL (varies by sex/age)
- Avoid aggressive targeting above 150 ng/mL in healthy populations
- Very low ferritin (< 20) associated with higher mortality even in non-anemic individuals

---

### Ferritin as Acute Phase Reactant & Inflammation Marker

#### Key Mechanism
- **Acute phase behavior:** Ferritin rises with inflammation/infection independent of iron status
- **Hepcidin regulation:** Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) upregulate hepcidin → iron retention in macrophages → ferritin elevation without true iron overload

#### Clinical Challenges
- **Elevated ferritin can indicate:**
  - True iron overload (rare in healthy populations)
  - Inflammation (infection, autoimmune disease, metabolic syndrome)
  - Liver disease (hepatocyte iron release)
  - Hemolysis (RBC breakdown releases ferritin)
  - Cancer (ferritin as tumor marker)

#### Differentiation Strategy
- **Elevated ferritin + LOW transferrin saturation (TSAT):** Likely inflammation, not iron overload
- **Elevated ferritin + HIGH TSAT (> 45%):** Suggestive of iron overload
- **Use together:** Ferritin + TSAT + soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) for accurate assessment

---

### Hemochromatosis Screening

#### When to Suspect
- Ferritin > 300 ng/mL in men or > 200 ng/mL in women (especially postmenopausal)
- Ferritin > 500 ng/mL warrants genetic testing
- **HFE gene mutation prevalence:** ~10% in European populations, but only ~1% develop clinical disease

#### Diagnostic Approach
| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Ferritin > 500 + TSAT > 45% | High suspicion; recommend genetic testing (HFE C282Y, H63D) |
| Ferritin 200–500 + TSAT > 50% | Moderate suspicion; genetic test recommended |
| Ferritin elevated + TSAT < 20% | Unlikely hemochromatosis; investigate inflammation |
| Ferritin > 1000 | Very high risk; genetic testing essential |

#### Treatment Goals
- **Hemochromatosis target ferritin:** 50–100 ng/mL (via phlebotomy or chelation)
- **Maintenance TSAT:** < 25–30%

---

### Differentiating Iron Overload from Inflammation

#### Laboratory Pattern Comparison

**TRUE IRON OVERLOAD (Hemochromatosis):**
| Parameter | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Serum ferritin | Elevated (500+) |
| TSAT (transferrin saturation) | **HIGH (> 45%)** |
| TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) | **LOW** (reduced transferrin) |
| Serum iron | Elevated |
| CRP/inflammation markers | Normal |
| sTfR (soluble transferrin receptor) | Normal or low |

**FUNCTIONAL IRON DEFICIENCY (Inflammation):**
| Parameter | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Serum ferritin | Elevated (due to hepcidin) |
| TSAT (transferrin saturation) | **LOW (< 20%)** |
| TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) | **LOW** (hepcidin suppresses transferrin) |
| Serum iron | Low |
| CRP/inflammation markers | **ELEVATED** |
| sTfR (soluble transferrin receptor) | **ELEVATED** (tissue iron need) |

#### Clinical Interpretation Example
- **Ferritin 250 + TSAT 15% + CRP 5:** Iron deficiency + inflammation (functional ID)
- **Ferritin 250 + TSAT 55% + CRP 0.8:** Iron overload (hemochromatosis risk)

## 4. FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE PERSPECTIVES

### OptimalDX Ranges (2024 Update)

OptimalDX recently revised their ferritin ranges based on mortality and inflammation data:

| Category | Range (ng/mL) | Scientific Rationale |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Low | < 15 | Below this: iron deficiency anemia risk |
| Below Optimal | 15–45 | Sensitivity/specificity 98% for IDA; symptoms likely |
| **Optimal** | **45–79** | Lowest mortality; reduced inflammation; optimal health |
| Above Optimal | 79–150 | Increased inflammatory biomarkers; cell damage begins |
| High | > 150 | Significant health risks; investigate cause |

**Key evidence:** Ferritin 70–79 ng/mL associated with:
- Lower all-cause mortality
- Lowest inflammatory marker elevation
- Better metabolic health
- Optimal thyroid function (TPO conversion)

---

### Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM) Approach

IFM emphasizes:
1. **Iron deficiency is common** in seemingly healthy adults, often masked by inflammation
2. **Functional ranges narrower** than conventional labs
3. **Assess iron holistically:** ferritin + TSAT + sTfR + inflammation markers
4. **Consider individual variation:** Athletes, vegetarians, menstruating women need higher targets

#### IFM-Aligned Recommendations
- **Target for most:** 50–100 ng/mL (emphasis on upper end for symptom relief)
- **Women with HMB:** 60–100 ng/mL (compensate for losses)
- **Athletes:** 50–130 ng/mL (see athletes section)
- **Post-supplementation:** Retest 8–12 weeks to assess absorption & response

---

### Ferritin & Thyroid Function

#### Mechanism: Iron-Dependent Thyroid Processes

| Thyroid Process | Iron Role |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **TPO enzyme** | Iron is essential cofactor for thyroid peroxidase; catalyzes T4/T3 synthesis |
| **T4 → T3 conversion** | Selenoprotein deiodinase requires iron for function |
| **Immune regulation** | Low ferritin → impaired T-regulatory cell function → TPO autoimmunity |

#### Optimal Ferritin for Thyroid Health
- **Functional target:** 90–110 ng/mL (specifically for Hashimoto's & hypothyroidism)
- **Alternative range:** 70–90 ng/mL minimum for symptom resolution
- **Clinical observation:** Many hypothyroid patients improve symptoms by raising ferritin to 100 (anecdotal but common)

#### Ferritin-TPO Relationship
- **Correlation:** Positive correlation between free thyroid hormones (T3/T4) and ferritin
- **Inverse correlation:** Negative correlation between TSH and ferritin
- **Low ferritin impact:** Mimics hypothyroid symptoms (fatigue, hair loss, weight gain) even with normal TSH/T4
- **Recommendation:** Check ferritin in all hypothyroid patients; supplement if < 70 ng/mL

---

### Ferritin & Hair Health

**Hair loss mechanisms (low ferritin):**
- Iron required for ribonucleotide reductase (DNA synthesis in hair follicles)
- Ferritin < 40 ng/mL associated with telogen effluvium (diffuse hair shedding)
- Hair regrowth typically occurs 8–12 weeks after ferritin normalization

**Optimal for hair health:** 70+ ng/mL (clinical experience from dermatologists)

---

### Ferritin & Energy/Mitochondrial Function

**Iron's mitochondrial role:**
- Cofactor for cytochrome c oxidase (electron transport chain)
- Required for Fe-S cluster synthesis (complex I, II, III)
- Essential for ATP production

**Energy impact:**
- Ferritin < 30 ng/mL: Impaired aerobic energy production (30% reduction in endurance capacity)
- Optimal range (50–80): Maximal mitochondrial efficiency
- > 150 ng/mL: Oxidative stress impairs mitochondrial function

---

### Cardiovascular Risk & Ferritin

#### Mortality Data
- **Ferritin > 200 ng/mL:** Associated with increased CV mortality in general population (Danish 23-year study)
- **Ferritin-CVD mechanism:** Iron catalyzes free radical formation via Fenton reaction → endothelial damage, atherosclerosis acceleration
- **Protective range:** 50–100 ng/mL (lower CV event rates)

#### At-Risk Populations
- **Postmenopausal women:** Ferritin > 150 ng/mL increases CV risk significantly
- **Men:** Higher baseline ferritin (50–200 ng/mL) associated with CV events
- **Diabetics:** Ferritin serves as marker of insulin resistance; elevated ferritin = worse prognosis

#### Clinical Practice Point
- Screen for and manage elevated ferritin in CAD prevention
- Iron restriction (dietary, phlebotomy) may reduce CV events in high ferritin populations

---

## 5. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

### ATHLETES (Endurance Sports & Strength Training)

#### Why Athletes Need More Iron
- **GI blood loss:** Long-distance running causes intestinal microbleeding (3–10% of runners)
- **Hemolysis:** Foot-strike hemolysis in runners; RBC destruction in intense training
- **Increased RBC turnover:** Training stimulates higher erythropoiesis (higher iron demand)
- **Sweat losses:** Iron lost in sweat (though less significant than GI/hemolysis)
- **Hepcidin suppression:** Acute endurance exercise suppresses hepcidin temporarily; chronic training may dysregulate hepcidin

#### Iron Requirements
- **Baseline increase:** 1.9 mg/day (women), 2.3 mg/day (men) for sea-level training
- **Altitude training:** Additional 4.9 mg/day iron requirement (hypoxia stimulates erythropoiesis)
- **Total need:** 11–13 mg/day for female endurance athletes; 10–12 mg/day for males

#### Ferritin Targets for Athletes
| Athlete Type | Optimal Ferritin | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Endurance** | 50–130 ng/mL | Higher threshold prevents performance decline |
| **Strength/anaerobic** | 40–80 ng/mL | Lower iron needs; standard functional range adequate |
| **Young athletes** | 30–40 ng/mL minimum | Traditional cutoff insufficient; 40–50 preferred |
| **Female athletes** | 50–100 ng/mL | Compensate for menstrual losses + training demands |

#### Performance Impact
- **Iron deficiency effect:** 3–4% endurance performance decrement
- **Repletion benefit:** 2–20% performance improvement with 100 mg/day elemental iron x 56 days
- **VO2max response:** 6–15% improvement with iron supplementation (16–100 mg/day, 36–126 days)

#### Iron Deficiency Prevalence
- **Female athletes:** Up to 60% experience iron deficiency (no anemia)
- **Male endurance athletes:** 10–20% prevalence (often undetected)

#### Monitoring Recommendations
- **Women athletes:** Hematological panel every 6 months
- **Men athletes:** Annually (or if symptoms develop)
- **Include in assessment:** Hemoglobin, ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, CRP (differentiate iron deficiency from inflammation)

---

### VEGETARIANS & VEGANS

#### Iron Absorption Challenges
- **Non-heme iron bioavailability:** 2–20% absorption (vs. 15–35% for heme iron)
- **Common inhibitors in plant foods:** Phytates, polyphenols, tannins (bind iron)
- **Absorption enhancement:** Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) increases non-heme absorption 3–4 fold

#### Ferritin Targets
- **Conservative target:** 50–70 ng/mL (higher than omnivores to maintain stores)
- **Recommendation:** Supplement with 25–50 mg elemental iron (ferrous bisglycinate preferred; better absorbed, fewer GI effects)
- **Timing:** Take with vitamin C source (orange juice, berries), away from calcium/coffee

#### Supplementation Strategy
- **Type:** Ferrous (Fe2+) forms better absorbed than ferric (Fe3+)
- **Forms:** Bisglycinate, fumarate, succinate (better tolerated than sulfate)
- **Frequency:** Every other day (upregulates hepcidin less than daily dosing; paradoxically better absorption)
- **Duration:** 8–12 weeks to assess ferritin response; retest

---

### BLOOD DONORS

#### Iron Loss per Donation
- **Standard whole blood donation:** 225–250 mg iron loss (1 unit ~ 8 oz)
- **Apheresis (plasma/platelets):** Minimal iron loss
- **Frequency impact:** Frequent donors (biweekly) at high risk for depletion

#### Ferritin Targets for Donors
- **Pre-donation threshold:** Ferritin should be > 40 ng/mL (some blood banks use > 50)
- **Donation frequency:** Men can donate every 8 weeks (if ferritin > 40); women 12+ weeks
- **Supplementation:** 25–50 mg elemental iron post-donation × 8–12 weeks

#### Screening Approach
- **Before donation:** Hemoglobin check (standard); ferritin screening recommended (not universal yet)
- **Regular donors:** Annual ferritin assessment
- **Defer if:** Ferritin < 30 ng/mL; address deficiency before next donation

## 6. SUMMARY: OPTIMAL FERRITIN RANGES BY POPULATION

| Population | Optimal Range (ng/mL) | Key Considerations |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Men (general)** | 45–79 | Avoid > 150 (CV risk); minimal loss mechanism |
| **Premenopausal women** | 40–80 | Account for menstrual loss; higher if HMB |
| **Postmenopausal women** | 45–80 | CVD risk if > 150; U-shaped metabolic risk |
| **Female endurance athletes** | 50–100 | Higher threshold; GI loss, hemolysis |
| **Male athletes** | 40–80 | Moderate increase; less demand than females |
| **Vegetarians/vegans** | 50–70 | Compensate for poor bioavailability |
| **Blood donors** | > 40 (pre-donation) | Maintain stores; supplement post-donation |
| **Thyroid patients** | 70–110 | TPO enzyme function; T4→T3 conversion |

## 7. DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM

### When Ferritin is Abnormal: Complete Workup

```
STEP 1: Measure ferritin
   ↓
STEP 2: If abnormal, measure TSAT + TIBC + serum iron
   ↓
STEP 3: Assess inflammation: CRP, ESR
   ↓
STEP 4: Interpret pattern:

   ├─ Ferritin HIGH + TSAT HIGH (>45%) + CRP normal
   │  → IRON OVERLOAD: Screen for hemochromatosis (HFE genetic test)
   │
   ├─ Ferritin HIGH + TSAT LOW (<20%) + CRP ELEVATED
   │  → FUNCTIONAL IRON DEFICIENCY: Treat inflammation first
   │
   ├─ Ferritin LOW + TSAT LOW + TIBC HIGH
   │  → IRON DEFICIENCY: Supplement iron (check source: GI bleed? absorption?)
   │
   └─ Ferritin NORMAL + TSAT LOW + sTfR ELEVATED
      → EARLY IRON DEFICIENCY: Before ferritin drops; treat now
```

### Complete Iron Panel Interpretation Table

| Ferritin | TSAT | TIBC | Interpretation | Action |
|----------|------|------|-----------------|--------|
| Low | Low | High | Iron deficiency | Investigate source; supplement |
| Low | Normal | Normal | Chronic disease; early ID | Monitor; supplement cautiously |
| Normal | Low | Low | Anemia of inflammation | Treat underlying condition |
| High | High | Low | Iron overload | Genetic testing; phlebotomy |
| High | Low | Low | Inflammation/infection | Anti-inflammatory; recheck after treatment |
| High | High | High | Hemolysis/liver disease | Specific workup for hemolysis/cirrhosis |

## 9. KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR PRACTITIONERS

1. **Ferritin is not iron status alone** — it's also an inflammation marker; use TSAT to clarify
2. **Optimal range (45–79 ng/mL) is narrower** than conventional labs; functional medicine targets within this band
3. **Sex/menopausal status matters** — postmenopausal women have 2–3x higher ferritin; adjust targets accordingly
4. **Menstruating women need higher targets** (40–80+) to offset monthly loss
5. **Athletes need 50–130 ng/mL** to support increased RBC turnover and GI losses
6. **Both low and high ferritin increase mortality** (U-shaped curve) — avoid aggressive targets > 150 in healthy populations
7. **Thyroid patients benefit from ferritin 70–110** (TPO enzyme function, T4→T3 conversion)
8. **Differentiate iron overload from inflammation** using TSAT + CRP pattern recognition
9. **Hemochromatosis screening threshold:** Ferritin > 300 (men) / > 200 (women) + high TSAT
10. **Recheck ferritin 8–12 weeks** after starting supplementation to confirm absorption and adjust dosing
