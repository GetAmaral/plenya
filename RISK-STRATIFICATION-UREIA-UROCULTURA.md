## 1. UREIA (Blood Urea Nitrogen - BUN)

### Overview

Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is a key biomarker for:
- **Renal function** - Kidney's ability to excrete metabolic waste
- **Protein metabolism** - Nitrogen waste from protein breakdown
- **Hydration status** - Elevated in dehydration, low in overhydration
- **Cardiovascular risk** - Independent predictor of CVD mortality

BUN is produced in the liver through the urea cycle, where ammonia (from protein catabolism) is converted to urea and excreted by the kidneys. Unlike creatinine, urea is reabsorbed by renal tubules (especially in dehydration), making it sensitive to volume status.

### Functional Medicine Context

**Optimal Range (Functional Medicine):** 13-18 mg/dL
**Conventional Clinical Range:** 6-24 mg/dL

Functional medicine practitioners use tighter ranges to detect subclinical dysfunction before disease manifests. Values outside the optimal range may indicate:

**Low BUN (<13 mg/dL):**
- Inadequate protein intake
- Malabsorption disorders
- Liver dysfunction (impaired urea synthesis)
- Overhydration
- Low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria)

**High BUN (>18 mg/dL):**
- Dehydration (most common)
- Excessive protein intake
- Prerenal azotemia (reduced renal perfusion)
- Intrinsic renal disease
- Upper GI bleeding
- Catabolic states (infection, burns, corticosteroid use)

### Units and Conversion

- **mg/dL (US standard)** → **mmol/L (SI units)**
- **Conversion factor:** mg/dL × 0.357 = mmol/L
- **Example:** 15 mg/dL × 0.357 = 5.36 mmol/L

### Clinical Evidence (2023-2026)

#### Cardiovascular Mortality Risk

**NHANES Study (2023):**
- Higher BUN levels associated with **CVD mortality** (HR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.02)
- **All-cause mortality** increased (HR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.28-1.72)
- U-shaped relationship observed in some populations

**Diabetes Population (2024):**
- Highest BUN group had **52% increased CVD mortality** (HR: 1.52)
- **35% increased all-cause mortality** (HR: 1.35)
- Nonlinear association with inflection point at **~5 mmol/L (14 mg/dL)**

**Coronary Artery Disease (2025 - Mendelian Randomization):**
- Genetically predicted higher BUN associated with **42% increased CAD risk** (OR: 1.42, 95% CI 1.226-1.644)
- Supports causal relationship independent of kidney function

**Heart Failure (2023 Meta-Analysis):**
- BUN identified as **strongest predictor** of mortality in hospitalized HF patients
- Independent of creatinine and eGFR

#### Key Insights:
- **Linear risk** for cardiovascular events above optimal range
- **Threshold effect** around 14-15 mg/dL for increased mortality
- Risk independent of traditional kidney function markers (creatinine, eGFR)
- Reflects systemic inflammation, neurohormonal activation, and protein catabolism

### BUN/Creatinine Ratio Context

**Normal Ratio:** 10:1 to 20:1

**High Ratio (>20:1):**
- Prerenal azotemia (dehydration, shock, hemorrhage)
- Upper GI bleeding
- High protein diet
- Catabolic states

**Low Ratio (<10:1):**
- Liver disease (impaired urea synthesis)
- Protein malnutrition
- Low protein diet
- SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH)

### Risk Stratification Table - UREIA (BUN)

**Format:** Nome;Unidade | Conversão;Idade;Nível 0;Nível 1;Nível 2;Nível 3;Nível 4;Nível 5;Nível 6

```
Ureia (BUN);mg/dL | mmol/L (×0.357);20;<6|Very Low - Liver dysfunction/malnutrition concern;6-10|Low - Possible inadequate protein or overhydration;10-13|Low-Normal - Below functional optimal;13-18|OPTIMAL - Functional medicine target;18-20|High-Normal - Monitor hydration/protein;20-30|Elevated - Dehydration or prerenal likely;>30|High Risk - Significant renal/prerenal dysfunction
```

### Detailed Risk Level Descriptions

#### **Nível 0: <6 mg/dL (<2.14 mmol/L) - Very Low**

---

### Risk Curve Characteristics

**Type:** U-shaped with stronger elevation risk

- **Low end (<10 mg/dL):** Increased risk from liver/protein issues
- **Optimal zone (13-18 mg/dL):** Lowest overall risk
- **High end (>20 mg/dL):** Linear increase in CVD/mortality risk
- **Inflection point:** ~14-15 mg/dL (5 mmol/L) for mortality increase

## 2. UROCULTURA (Urine Culture with Colony Count and Antibiogram)

### Overview

Urine culture is the **gold standard** for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs). It identifies:
- **Bacterial species** causing infection
- **Colony count** (CFU/mL) to distinguish infection from contamination
- **Antimicrobial susceptibility** (antibiogram) to guide treatment

Unlike urinalysis (which detects pyuria, bacteriuria, nitrites), urine culture quantifies viable bacteria and determines antibiotic resistance patterns.

### Key Concepts

**CFU/mL:** Colony-Forming Units per milliliter - measures viable bacterial count

**Contamination vs Infection:**
- **Contamination:** Mixed flora (≥3 species), high squamous cells (>100), low CFU
- **True Infection:** Single organism (or 2), low squamous cells (<20), adequate CFU with symptoms

**Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB):**
- Bacteria in urine without symptoms
- Generally **NOT treated** except in pregnancy and pre-urologic surgery
- Treating ASB increases antibiotic resistance without benefit

### Updated Diagnostic Thresholds (2024-2025)

**Traditional Threshold:** ≥10⁵ CFU/mL (100,000 CFU/mL)

**Current Evidence-Based Thresholds (AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025):**

| Population | Threshold | Sensitivity/Specificity |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Symptomatic women** | ≥10² CFU/mL (100 CFU/mL) E. coli | PPV 88-93% for bladder bacteriuria |
| **Symptomatic men** | ≥10³-10⁴ CFU/mL (1,000-10,000) | Higher specificity needed |
| **High-risk patients** | ≥10²-10⁴ CFU/mL (100-10,000) | Context-dependent |
| **Average-risk women** | ≥10⁵ CFU/mL (100,000) | Traditional threshold |
| **Catheterized samples** | ≥10⁴-10⁵ CFU/mL (10,000-100,000) | Lower contamination risk |
| **Pediatric (catheter)** | ≥5×10⁴ CFU/mL (50,000) | ≥10,000 if high suspicion + E. coli |

**Critical Principle (2024 Consensus):**
> "Even cultures with uropathogen growth >100,000 CFU/mL do not require treatment in patients **without symptoms**, and true UTI may be associated with uropathogen growth <100,000 CFU/mL."

### Signs of Contamination

**Culture Characteristics:**
- ≥3 bacterial species
- Mixed skin/genital flora (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium)
- Low to moderate CFU with multiple organisms

**Urinalysis Clues:**
- Squamous epithelial cells **>100/hpf** → Likely contamination (ignore culture)
- Squamous cells **20-100/hpf** → Interpret with caution
- Squamous cells **<20/hpf** → Good quality specimen

**Action:** If contamination suspected, **recollect specimen** with proper technique (midstream clean-catch, avoid touching collection cup)

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB) - IDSA 2019 Guidelines

**Definition:**
- Women: 2 consecutive specimens with **≥10⁵ CFU/mL** same organism, no symptoms
- Men: 1 clean-catch specimen with **≥10⁵ CFU/mL**, no symptoms

**When to Screen and Treat:**
- ✅ **Pregnant women** (screen all, treat if positive)
- ✅ **Pre-urologic surgery** with mucosal trauma expected

**When NOT to Screen or Treat:**
- ❌ Healthy non-pregnant women
- ❌ Men without urologic procedures
- ❌ Diabetic patients
- ❌ Elderly (community-dwelling or nursing home)
- ❌ Patients with chronic catheters
- ❌ Spinal cord injury patients
- ❌ Delirium/falls in elderly (assess other causes first)

**Rationale:** Treating ASB **does not** reduce symptomatic UTI, hospitalizations, or mortality, and increases antibiotic resistance and adverse effects.

### Common Uropathogens and Resistance Patterns

**Most Common Organisms:**

1. **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** - 75-95% of uncomplicated UTIs
   - Most reliable single organism for diagnosis
   - Increasing fluoroquinolone resistance (20-30% in some regions)
   - ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) producers emerging

2. **Klebsiella pneumoniae** - 5-10%
   - Often hospital-acquired
   - Higher ESBL rates

3. **Proteus mirabilis** - 5%
   - Associated with kidney stones (urease producer)

4. **Enterococcus species** - 5-10%
   - Often catheter-associated
   - Increasing vancomycin resistance (VRE)

5. **Staphylococcus saprophyticus** - 5-10% (young sexually active women)

6. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** - Hospital/catheter-associated, multidrug resistance common

### Antibiogram Interpretation

**First-line Agents (Uncomplicated UTI):**
- Nitrofurantoin (resistance <5%)
- Fosfomycin (resistance <2%)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if local resistance <20%)

**Second-line:**
- Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) - reserve due to resistance
- Beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins)

**Resistance Concerns:**
- **ESBL producers:** Resistant to most beta-lactams (use carbapenems)
- **Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE):** Limited options
- Always treat based on **local resistance patterns** and antibiogram

### Risk Stratification Table - UROCULTURA

**Note:** Urocultura is **qualitative/semi-quantitative** rather than continuous numeric, so risk levels are based on **CFU/mL ranges + clinical context**.

**Format:** Nome;Unidade | Conversão;Idade;Nível 0;Nível 1;Nível 2;Nível 3;Nível 4;Nível 5;Nível 6

```
Urocultura;CFU/mL | Log10 CFU;20;Negative/No growth|No bacteria - Normal result;Mixed flora ≥3 species|Contamination - Recollect specimen;<10²|<100 CFU - Not significant unless immunocompromised;10²-10⁴|100-10,000 CFU - Possible UTI if symptomatic + single organism;10⁴-10⁵|10,000-100,000 CFU - UTI likely if symptomatic + uropathogen;≥10⁵|≥100,000 CFU - UTI confirmed (treat if symptomatic);≥10⁵ + ASB|≥100,000 CFU asymptomatic - ASB (treat ONLY if pregnant/pre-surgery)
```

### Detailed Risk Level Descriptions

#### **Nível 0: Negative / No Growth - Normal**
**Clinical Significance:** No infection
- No bacterial growth after 24-48 hours incubation
- Normal result
- Sterile urine

**Action:** No treatment needed. If symptoms persist, consider:
- Non-bacterial causes (interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder)
- Fastidious organisms (e.g., Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma - requires special media)
- Recent antibiotic use suppressing growth

---

#### **Nível 1: Mixed Flora ≥3 Species - Contamination**
**Clinical Significance:** Specimen contamination
- ≥3 bacterial species grown
- Often includes skin/vaginal flora (coagulase-negative Staph, Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium)
- Urinalysis typically shows >100 squamous cells
- **Not interpretable** for UTI diagnosis

**Action:**
- **Do NOT treat** - this is contamination, not infection
- **Recollect specimen** with proper technique:
  - Midstream clean-catch
  - Cleanse periurethral area
  - First portion of urine into toilet, then collect midstream
  - Avoid touching inside of collection cup
- If catheterized sample, ensure proper sterile technique

---

#### **Nível 2: <10² CFU/mL (<100 CFU) - Not Significant**
**Clinical Significance:** Very low bacterial count
- Below diagnostic threshold for UTI
- May represent:
  - Transient bacteriuria
  - Low-level contamination
  - Early infection (rare)

**Action:**
- **No treatment** in immunocompetent patients
- If severely immunocompromised (neutropenia, transplant) + symptoms → consider treatment
- Reassess if symptoms persist

---

#### **Nível 3: 10²-10⁴ CFU/mL (100-10,000 CFU) - Possible UTI**
**Clinical Significance:** Low to moderate count - context critical
- **WITH symptoms + single uropathogen (E. coli):** Likely UTI (PPV 88-93% per 2025 AUA guidelines)
- **WITHOUT symptoms:** Not significant, do not treat
- Symptomatic women: **NEW 2025 threshold** - consider treatment
- Men: Usually requires higher count (≥10³-10⁴)

**Action:**
- **If symptomatic + single uropathogen:** Treat empirically, adjust based on antibiogram
- **If asymptomatic:** No treatment (ASB)
- **If mixed organisms:** Likely contamination, recollect
- Urinalysis correlation: Look for pyuria (WBC >5/hpf), nitrites, leukocyte esterase

---

#### **Nível 4: 10⁴-10⁵ CFU/mL (10,000-100,000) - UTI Likely**
**Clinical Significance:** Moderate count - UTI probable if symptomatic
- **WITH symptoms:** UTI confirmed, treat
- **WITHOUT symptoms:** ASB (usually do not treat)
- Single uropathogen expected (E. coli most common)
- Urinalysis typically shows pyuria

**Action:**
- **If symptomatic:** Empiric treatment per local guidelines
  - First-line: Nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or TMP-SMX (if resistance <20%)
  - Adjust based on antibiogram when available
- **If asymptomatic:** No treatment unless pregnant or pre-urologic surgery
- Duration: 3 days (uncomplicated), 5-7 days (men/complicated), 7-14 days (pyelonephritis)

---

#### **Nível 5: ≥10⁵ CFU/mL (≥100,000) - UTI Confirmed**
**Clinical Significance:** Classic diagnostic threshold
- **WITH symptoms:** Definite UTI, treat
- **WITHOUT symptoms:** ASB (see level 6)
- Meets traditional Kass criteria (1956)
- High specificity for bladder bacteriuria

**Action:**
- **If symptomatic:** Treat based on antibiogram
  - Uncomplicated cystitis: 3-day course first-line agents
  - Complicated/men: 5-7 days
  - Pyelonephritis: 7-14 days, consider hospitalization if septic
- Antibiogram interpretation:
  - **Susceptible (S):** Use this antibiotic
  - **Intermediate (I):** May work at higher doses, consider alternatives
  - **Resistant (R):** Do not use
- Follow-up culture only if symptoms persist after treatment

---

#### **Nível 6: ≥10⁵ CFU/mL + ASB (Asymptomatic) - Special Considerations**
**Clinical Significance:** Asymptomatic Bacteriuria - generally benign
- High bacterial count **WITHOUT** UTI symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency, fever)
- Common in elderly (10-20% women, 5-10% men), diabetics, catheterized patients
- **NOT an infection requiring treatment** in most cases

**When to TREAT ASB:**
- ✅ **Pregnant women** - Screen all at 12-16 weeks, treat if positive (prevents pyelonephritis, preterm birth)
- ✅ **Pre-urologic surgery** with anticipated mucosal bleeding (TURP, cystoscopy with biopsy)

**When NOT to treat ASB:**
- ❌ Non-pregnant women (all ages)
- ❌ Men without upcoming urologic procedures
- ❌ Diabetic patients (no benefit shown)
- ❌ Elderly/nursing home residents (no benefit, increases resistance)
- ❌ Chronic indwelling catheter patients
- ❌ Spinal cord injury patients
- ❌ Delirium/falls in elderly (treat other causes, not urine)

**Action:**
- **If pregnant or pre-surgery:** Treat per antibiogram, confirm clearance with repeat culture
- **All others:** **No treatment**, document as ASB, educate patient/family
- **If later develops symptoms:** Treat as symptomatic UTI (may be different organism)

**Rationale:** Multiple RCTs show treating ASB in non-pregnant populations does **NOT**:
- Reduce symptomatic UTI episodes
- Prevent hospitalizations
- Reduce mortality
- Improve outcomes

**Harms of treating ASB:**
- Antibiotic resistance (individual and community)
- Adverse drug effects (C. difficile, allergic reactions)
- Healthcare costs
- Medicalization of normal colonization

### Functional Medicine Considerations for Recurrent UTIs

**Root Cause Analysis (Beyond Antibiotics):**

1. **Anatomical/Mechanical:**
   - Post-void residual (incomplete emptying)
   - Pelvic floor dysfunction
   - Sexual activity (ensure post-coital voiding)

2. **Immune Function:**
   - Vitamin D optimization (>30 ng/mL, optimal 50-80)
   - Zinc status
   - Mucosal IgA deficiency

3. **Microbiome:**
   - Vaginal dysbiosis (loss of Lactobacillus dominance)
   - Gut-bladder axis
   - Probiotic support (Lactobacillus crispatus, rhamnosus)

4. **Metabolic:**
   - Blood sugar control (diabetes increases UTI risk)
   - Estrogen status (postmenopausal women - consider topical estrogen)

5. **Lifestyle:**
   - Hydration (adequate but not excessive)
   - Cranberry supplementation (proanthocyanidins 36 mg/day)
   - D-mannose (prevents E. coli adhesion)
   - Avoid irritants (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods)

**Preventive Strategies (Functional Medicine):**
- **D-mannose:** 2g daily (or BID during active infection) - prevents bacterial adhesion
- **Probiotics:** Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 + L. reuteri RC-14 (vaginal health)
- **Cranberry:** Standardized extract (36 mg PACs) or whole berry
- **Vitamin C:** 500-1000 mg/day (acidifies urine - but NOT during active infection with certain antibiotics)
- **Topical estrogen:** Postmenopausal women (vaginal estriol cream)
- **Methenamine hippurate:** Prophylactic urinary antiseptic (if recurrent UTIs >2/year)

## Conversion Tools

### BUN Conversion Calculator

```
mg/dL to mmol/L: multiply by 0.357
mmol/L to mg/dL: multiply by 2.801

Examples:
- 15 mg/dL = 15 × 0.357 = 5.36 mmol/L
- 6 mmol/L = 6 × 2.801 = 16.8 mg/dL
```

### CFU/mL to Log10 Conversion

```
CFU/mL        → Log10
100           → 10² (2 log)
1,000         → 10³ (3 log)
10,000        → 10⁴ (4 log)
100,000       → 10⁵ (5 log)
1,000,000     → 10⁶ (6 log)
```

## Clinical Decision Trees

### BUN Interpretation Algorithm

```
BUN result received
    ↓
Is it <6 mg/dL?
    YES → Check liver function (ALT, AST, albumin), assess nutrition
    NO ↓
Is it 13-18 mg/dL?
    YES → OPTIMAL - no action needed
    NO ↓
Is it >20 mg/dL?
    YES → Check BUN/Cr ratio
        >20:1 → Prerenal (check hydration, volume status)
        10-20:1 → Check creatinine, eGFR (possible intrinsic renal)
        <10:1 → Check liver function
    NO → Monitor trend, assess protein intake
```

### Urocultura Interpretation Algorithm

```
Urine culture result received
    ↓
Is growth "Mixed flora" or ≥3 species?
    YES → CONTAMINATION - recollect specimen
    NO ↓
Is patient symptomatic (dysuria, frequency, urgency, fever)?
    NO → ASB pathway:
        Pregnant or pre-urologic surgery?
            YES → Treat per antibiogram
            NO → Do NOT treat, document ASB
    YES ↓ (Symptomatic)
What is the CFU/mL count?
    <100 → Do not treat (unless immunocompromised)
    100-10,000 → Single uropathogen? YES → Treat | NO → Recollect
    >10,000 → Treat per antibiogram
```
