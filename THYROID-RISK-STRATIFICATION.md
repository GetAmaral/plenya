**Research Date:** January 2026
**Evidence Base:** 2023-2026 Literature, Functional Medicine Guidelines (OptimalDX, IFM, A4M)
**Target:** EMR System Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides evidence-based risk stratification for thyroid function tests (TSH, Free T4, Free T3) based on functional integrative medicine principles. Unlike conventional laboratory ranges that focus on disease diagnosis, functional medicine emphasizes optimal ranges for health promotion and longevity.

**Key Findings:**
- **TSH exhibits a U-shaped/J-shaped mortality curve** - both low and high values within "normal" ranges carry increased cardiovascular and mortality risk
- **Optimal ranges are narrower** than conventional lab ranges (e.g., TSH 1.0-2.5 vs 0.4-4.5 mIU/L)
- **Age and sex significantly impact** reference ranges, particularly after age 50
- **FT3:FT4 ratio** is critical for assessing thyroid hormone conversion (optimal: 2.4-2.7)

---

## 1. TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (J-SHAPED)**

**Rationale:** The landmark 2023 Thyroid Studies Collaboration meta-analysis (134,346 participants, 11.5-year follow-up) demonstrated a J-shaped association where both low (0-20th percentiles) and high TSH values (>80th percentile) increased cardiovascular disease and mortality risk. The 60th-80th percentiles (median 1.90-2.90 mIU/L) conveyed the lowest risk.

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** mIU/L (milli-International Units per Liter)
- Also expressed as: mU/L, μIU/mL
- **Conversion Factor:** 1.0 (same across conventional and SI units)
- No conversion needed between mIU/L and mU/L

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

| Parameter | Conventional Lab Range | Functional Medicine Optimal Range | Evidence Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **TSH** | 0.4-4.5 mIU/L (some labs 0.5-5.0) | **1.0-2.5 mIU/L** | OptimalDX, IFM, A4M consensus |
| **Evidence-Based Optimal** | - | **1.90-2.90 mIU/L** (60-80th percentile) | Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2023 |

**Key Differences from Conventional Ranges:**
- Functional medicine targets are **2-3x narrower** than standard lab ranges
- Upper limit is ~50% lower (2.5 vs 4.5 mIU/L)
- Emphasizes prevention and optimization rather than disease diagnosis
- Subclinical hypothyroidism in conventional medicine (TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L) is addressed proactively in functional medicine at TSH >2.5 mIU/L if symptomatic

### Risk Stratification Levels

| Risk Level | TSH Range (mIU/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <0.1 | Severe hyperthyroidism, suppressed TSH; high risk of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, cardiovascular events. Requires immediate endocrine evaluation. | <0.1: Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism |
| **LOW** | 0.1-0.4 | Grade 1 subclinical hyperthyroidism; increased cardiovascular risk (7% higher cardiac death, 9% higher all-cause mortality vs optimal range); monitor for atrial fibrillation especially in age >65. | 0.1-0.4: Grade 1 subclinical hyperthyroidism |
| **SUBOPTIMAL LOW** | 0.4-1.0 | Below functional medicine optimal; may indicate early hyperthyroidism or excessive thyroid hormone replacement; monitor thyroid antibodies (TPO, TgAb) and symptoms. | <1.0: Below functional medicine target |
| **OPTIMAL** | 1.0-2.5 | **Functional Medicine Optimal Range**; associated with lowest cardiovascular disease and mortality risk; target for most healthy adults. | 1.0-2.5: Core functional medicine target |
| **EVIDENCE-BASED OPTIMAL** | 1.9-2.9 | **60-80th percentile range** from 2023 meta-analysis; statistically lowest risk for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. | 1.9-2.9: Epidemiological sweet spot |
| **SUBOPTIMAL HIGH** | 2.5-4.5 | Within conventional "normal" but above functional medicine optimal; may indicate early hypothyroidism, especially if symptomatic; consider comprehensive thyroid panel (FT4, FT3, rT3, antibodies). | >2.5: Above functional medicine target |
| **ELEVATED** | 4.5-10.0 | Grade 1 subclinical hypothyroidism; treatment recommended if: age <70, TSH persistently >7.0, positive thyroid antibodies, cardiovascular risk factors, or symptomatic. | >4.5: Conventional subclinical hypothyroidism threshold |
| **CRITICAL HIGH** | >10.0 | Grade 2 subclinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism; levothyroxine treatment recommended for most patients age <70; significant cardiovascular risk. | >10.0: Treatment threshold for most guidelines |

### Age-Specific Reference Ranges

**Critical Consideration:** TSH naturally increases with age, especially after age 50 in women and 60 in men.

| Age Group | Upper Reference Limit (mIU/L) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 20-30 years | 3.6 | 97.5th percentile |
| 30-40 years | 4.0 | Women median: 1.5 (range 0.5-4.6) |
| 50 years | 4.0 | Median ~1.7 |
| 60 years | 5.0 | Women median: 1.9 (range 0.7-7.8) |
| 70 years | 6.0 | Increases by 0.3 mIU/L per decade after age 40 |
| 80+ years | 7.5 | Median: 2.57 (range 0.86-7.56) |

**French Endocrine Society Formula:** Upper limit = Age/10 (e.g., 70-year-old → 7.0 mIU/L upper limit)

**Clinical Impact:** Using age-specific ranges reduces subclinical hypothyroidism diagnosis by 35-78% in elderly populations, preventing unnecessary levothyroxine prescriptions.

### Sex-Specific Considerations

- **Women:** Higher TSH values than men across all age groups; TSH increases progressively with age
- **Men:** Lower average TSH; minor increases with age compared to women
- **Women 30s:** Median TSH 1.5 mIU/L (2.5th-97.5th: 0.5-4.6)
- **Women 60s:** Median TSH 1.9 mIU/L (2.5th-97.5th: 0.7-7.8)

### Key Evidence (2023-2026)

**Landmark Study:**
- **Xu Y, et al. (Thyroid Studies Collaboration).** "The optimal healthy ranges of thyroid function defined by the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality: systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis." *Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology* 2023.
  - **N=134,346 participants, 11.5-year follow-up**
  - **Finding:** J-shaped association - TSH 60-80th percentiles (1.90-2.90 mIU/L) had lowest cardiovascular disease and mortality risk
  - **Risk at extremes:**
    - TSH 0-20th percentiles: HR 1.07 for composite outcome, HR 1.09 for all-cause mortality
    - TSH >80th percentile: Increased risk (specific HR varies by age/sex)

**Population Studies:**
- Age-specific reference ranges reduce overdiagnosis: 50% in women 30-39, up to 78% in women 60-69 when using age/sex-specific ranges vs manufacturer ranges
- Multicenter Japanese study (2023): Demonstrated significant reduction in subclinical hypothyroidism diagnosis with age/sex-specific ranges

**Functional Medicine Sources:**
- OptimalDX: TSH optimal range 1.0-2.5 mIU/L
- Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM): Narrower ranges (0.5-2.5 mIU/L) emphasizing symptom correlation
- American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M): Target TSH 1.0-2.0 mIU/L for optimal metabolic function

### Special Considerations

**Context Dependencies:**
1. **Pregnancy:** Different targets (1st trimester: <2.5 mIU/L; 2nd/3rd: <3.0 mIU/L)
2. **Thyroid Medication:** Target TSH on levothyroxine: 1.0-2.5 mIU/L for most; 0.5-2.0 for some functional medicine practitioners
3. **Thyroid Cancer:** May require TSH suppression (<0.1-0.5 mIU/L) depending on risk stratification
4. **Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TSH 2.5-4.5):** Functional medicine treats if symptomatic; conventional medicine often watches

**Common Confounders:**
- **Biotin supplementation:** Causes falsely LOW TSH results (sandwich immunoassay interference); discontinue 3-7 days before testing
- **Time of day:** TSH highest in early morning, decreases throughout day (~30% variation)
- **Acute illness:** Nonthyroidal illness syndrome can suppress TSH
- **Medications:** Corticosteroids, dopamine, metformin can lower TSH; lithium, amiodarone can raise TSH
- **Recent thyroid hormone dose:** Take levothyroxine AFTER blood draw

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**
- **Discordant TSH/FT4:** If TSH normal but FT4 low, consider central hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic dysfunction)
- **TSH >2.5 with symptoms:** Functional medicine approach is to check full panel (FT4, FT3, rT3, TPO Ab, Tg Ab) and consider trial of thyroid hormone if antibody-positive or significantly symptomatic
- **Spontaneous normalization:** 50-60% of elderly patients with TSH 4.5-7.0 spontaneously normalize within 2-5 years
- **U-shaped curve implications:** Both over- and under-replacement with levothyroxine increase mortality risk

---

## 2. Free T4 (Free Thyroxine, FT4)

### Risk Curve Type: **J-SHAPED**

**Rationale:** The 2023 Thyroid Studies Collaboration meta-analysis demonstrated a J-shaped association where higher percentiles of FT4 were associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, particularly in elderly and women. The 20th-40th percentiles (median 13.5-14.8 pmol/L or ~1.05-1.15 ng/dL) conveyed the lowest risk. Very low FT4 also increases risk of hypothyroidism-related morbidity.

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter) - used in USA
**Alternative Unit:** pmol/L (picomoles per liter) - used internationally (SI units)

**Conversion Factors:**
- **ng/dL to pmol/L:** Multiply by **12.87**
- **pmol/L to ng/dL:** Divide by 12.87 (or multiply by 0.0777)

**Example:** FT4 = 1.2 ng/dL × 12.87 = 15.4 pmol/L

### Manufacturer-Specific Reference Ranges

| Manufacturer | Reference Range (ng/dL) | Reference Range (pmol/L) |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Abbott | 0.70-1.48 | 9.0-19.0 |
| Tosoh | 0.75-1.90 | 9.7-24.4 |
| Roche | 0.70-1.70 | 9.0-21.9 |
| Siemens | 0.80-1.80 | 10.3-23.2 |

**2024 Updated Reference Range:** 8.0-18.0 pmol/L (0.62-1.40 ng/dL)

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

| Parameter | Conventional Lab Range | Functional Medicine Optimal Range | Evidence Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **FT4 (ng/dL)** | 0.70-1.90 | **1.0-1.50** | OptimalDX (ODX) |
| **FT4 (pmol/L)** | 9.0-24.4 | **12.9-19.3** | Calculated from ODX |
| **Evidence-Based Optimal (pmol/L)** | - | **13.5-14.8** (20-40th percentile) | Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2023 |
| **Evidence-Based Optimal (ng/dL)** | - | **1.05-1.15** | Calculated from meta-analysis |

**Key Differences from Conventional Ranges:**
- Functional medicine optimal range is **50% narrower** than conventional (1.0-1.5 vs 0.7-1.9 ng/dL)
- **Lower upper limit:** 1.50 vs 1.90 ng/dL (OptimalDX)
- **Higher lower limit:** 1.0 vs 0.7-0.8 ng/dL
- Emphasizes mid-range values for optimal metabolic function and cardiovascular health

### Risk Stratification Levels

| Risk Level | FT4 Range (ng/dL) | FT4 Range (pmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <0.5 | <6.4 | Severe hypothyroidism; myxedema coma risk; immediate endocrine evaluation and levothyroxine initiation required. | <0.5 ng/dL: Medical emergency |
| **LOW** | 0.5-0.7 | 6.4-9.0 | Overt hypothyroidism if TSH elevated; subclinical if TSH normal (central hypothyroidism); levothyroxine treatment typically indicated. | <0.7 ng/dL: Below conventional range |
| **SUBOPTIMAL LOW** | 0.7-1.0 | 9.0-12.9 | Below functional medicine optimal but within conventional range; may have symptoms of hypothyroidism despite "normal" TSH; check FT3, rT3, thyroid antibodies. | <1.0 ng/dL: Below functional medicine target |
| **OPTIMAL** | 1.0-1.5 | 12.9-19.3 | **Functional Medicine Optimal Range (OptimalDX)**; associated with optimal metabolic function, energy, and cardiovascular health. | 1.0-1.5 ng/dL: Core functional medicine target |
| **EVIDENCE-BASED OPTIMAL** | 1.05-1.15 | 13.5-14.8 | **20-40th percentile range** from 2023 meta-analysis; statistically lowest risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. | 1.05-1.15 ng/dL: Epidemiological sweet spot |
| **SUBOPTIMAL HIGH** | 1.5-1.9 | 19.3-24.4 | Within conventional range but above functional medicine optimal; may indicate early hyperthyroidism, excessive levothyroxine dose, or increased deiodinase activity; monitor for cardiac symptoms. | >1.5 ng/dL: Above functional medicine target |
| **ELEVATED** | 1.9-2.3 | 24.4-29.6 | Above conventional range; suggests hyperthyroidism if TSH low, or assay interference if TSH normal; check for biotin supplementation; cardiovascular risk increases. | >1.9 ng/dL: Above conventional range |
| **CRITICAL HIGH** | >2.3 | >29.6 | Overt hyperthyroidism; high risk of atrial fibrillation (8x risk if >23.9 pmol/L), cardiac arrhythmias, thyroid storm; requires immediate anti-thyroid treatment. | >2.3 ng/dL (>29.6 pmol/L): Medical emergency threshold |

### Age and Sex-Specific Considerations

**Sex Differences:**
- **Men:** Higher FT4 levels than women across all age groups
- **Men 30s:** Median 1.3 ng/dL (range 1.0-1.7)
- **Men 60s:** Median 1.2 ng/dL (range 1.0-1.6) - gradually decreases with age
- **Women:** FT4 remains relatively stable with age (no significant change)
- **Women 30s:** Median ~1.2 ng/dL
- **Women 60s:** Median ~1.2 ng/dL

**Age-Related Changes:**
- FT4 decreases gradually in men (~0.1 ng/dL per decade)
- FT4 remains stable in women throughout aging
- Elderly reference range (>60 years): 12.0-19.87 pmol/L (0.93-1.54 ng/dL)

### Key Evidence (2023-2026)

**Landmark Study:**
- **Xu Y, et al. (Thyroid Studies Collaboration).** "The optimal healthy ranges of thyroid function defined by the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality." *Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology* 2023.
  - **J-shaped association:** 20-40th percentiles of FT4 (median 13.5-14.8 pmol/L) had lowest cardiovascular disease and mortality risk
  - **Risk at high FT4:** More than 5% increase in 10-year composite risk for FT4 >85th percentile, especially in women and men >70 years
  - **Mechanism:** Higher FT4 increases vascular resistance, cardiac contractility, heart rate, left ventricular mass, and arrhythmogenic potential

**Cardiovascular Studies (2024):**
- **Ethiopian study 2024:** FT4 >23.9 pmol/L (>1.86 ng/dL) associated with **8-fold increased odds** of atrial fibrillation vs FT4 <10.3 pmol/L
- **Rotterdam Study:** Highest quartile of FT4 (even within normal range) associated with 63% increased risk of atrial fibrillation (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.19-2.22)

**Functional Medicine Sources:**
- **OptimalDX:** FT4 optimal range 1.0-1.5 ng/dL (12.9-19.3 pmol/L)
- **Rupa Health, IFM:** Emphasize comprehensive thyroid panel interpretation with FT3, rT3, and ratios rather than FT4 alone
- **Dr. Amy Myers MD:** FT4 functional range 1.0-1.53 ng/dL

**Platform Comparison Studies:**
- Age/sex-specific reference ranges reduce subclinical thyroid dysfunction misdiagnosis by up to 50-78% compared to manufacturer ranges
- LC-MS/MS (mass spectrometry) is gold standard; immunoassays subject to interference from heterophile antibodies, biotin

### Special Considerations

**Context Dependencies:**

1. **Pregnancy:**
   - FT4 decreases throughout pregnancy (trimester-specific ranges needed)
   - Method-specific reference ranges essential
   - Targets: 1st trimester upper 1/3 of range, 2nd/3rd trimester mid-to-upper range

2. **Thyroid Hormone Replacement:**
   - On levothyroxine (T4) monotherapy: Target FT4 mid-to-upper functional medicine range (1.2-1.5 ng/dL)
   - On T4/T3 combination: May see lower FT4 (1.0-1.2 ng/dL) with adequate FT3
   - Timing: Measure BEFORE morning dose for accurate trough level

3. **Critical Illness:**
   - Nonthyroidal illness syndrome: FT4 may be low-normal or low with normal/low TSH
   - Not true hypothyroidism; usually resolves with recovery

4. **High FT4 with Normal TSH:**
   - Consider: Biotin interference, heterophile antibodies, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia
   - Biotin causes falsely HIGH FT4 (competitive immunoassay)
   - Stop biotin 3-7 days before testing

**Common Confounders:**

| Confounder | Effect on FT4 | Mechanism | Management |
|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Biotin (>5 mg/day)** | Falsely HIGH | Competitive immunoassay interference (Roche, Siemens) | Stop 3-7 days before testing |
| **Heterophile antibodies** | Variable (high or low) | Immunoassay interference | Use LC-MS/MS or different assay platform |
| **Acute illness** | Low-normal to low | Decreased T4 to T3 conversion (nonthyroidal illness syndrome) | Retest after recovery |
| **High-dose steroids** | Low | Decreased TBG, increased clearance | Expected; retest off steroids |
| **Heparin** | Falsely HIGH | In vitro release of FFA displacing T4 from binding proteins | Avoid heparin tubes |
| **Pregnancy** | Lower by trimester | Increased TBG, hemodilution, placental deiodinase | Use trimester-specific ranges |
| **Albumin/TBG disorders** | Variable | Altered binding protein levels | Check Total T4 or use equilibrium dialysis |

**FT3:FT4 Ratio (Critical for Conversion Assessment):**
- Indicates efficiency of T4 to T3 conversion by deiodinases
- **Optimal ratio:** 2.4-2.7 (FT3 in pg/mL, FT4 in ng/dL)
- **Low ratio (<2.2):** Impaired conversion; selenium deficiency, chronic stress, liver dysfunction, elevated rT3
- **High ratio (>2.9):** Hyperthyroidism, excessive T3 supplementation, increased deiodinase activity

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**
- **FT4 high, TSH normal:** Rule out biotin, check repeat on different platform, consider resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH)
- **FT4 low, TSH normal/low:** Central hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic); check other pituitary hormones, MRI
- **FT4 high, TSH suppressed:** Hyperthyroidism; check thyroid antibodies (TRAb for Graves), thyroid uptake scan
- **FT4 mid-range, symptoms present:** Check FT3, rT3, FT3:rT3 ratio; may have conversion issues despite adequate FT4

---

## 3. Free T3 (Free Triiodothyronine, FT3)

### Risk Curve Type: **LINEAR (Lower values worse)**

**Rationale:** FT3 is the active thyroid hormone. Lower FT3 levels are consistently associated with poor metabolic function, decreased muscle mass, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and increased mortality. Unlike TSH and FT4, there is no clear U-shaped curve for FT3 in most populations - higher values within the normal range are generally associated with better metabolic health, with risk primarily at very high levels (overt hyperthyroidism) or very low levels (hypothyroidism or poor T4→T3 conversion).

**Note:** Some studies suggest J-shaped association in specific populations (very elderly, advanced heart failure), but the predominant pattern is linear - lower is worse, mid-to-upper range is optimal.

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit:** pg/mL (picograms per milliliter) - used in USA
**Alternative Unit:** pmol/L (picomoles per liter) - used internationally (SI units)

**Conversion Factors:**
- **pg/mL to pmol/L:** Multiply by **1.536**
- **pmol/L to pg/mL:** Divide by 1.536 (or multiply by 0.651)
- **Some labs use ng/dL:** 1 pg/mL = 0.1 ng/dL

**Example:** FT3 = 3.5 pg/mL × 1.536 = 5.38 pmol/L

### Manufacturer-Specific Reference Ranges

| Manufacturer | Reference Range (pg/mL) | Reference Range (pmol/L) |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Abbott | 1.71-3.71 | 2.6-5.7 |
| Tosoh | 1.8-3.5 | 2.8-5.4 |
| General Labs | 2.0-4.4 | 3.1-6.8 |
| International | - | 3.8-6.0 |

**2024 Updated Reference Range:** 3.8-6.0 pmol/L (2.47-3.90 pg/mL)

### Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

| Parameter | Conventional Lab Range | Functional Medicine Optimal Range | Evidence Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **FT3 (pg/mL)** | 2.0-4.4 | **3.2-4.2** | Functional medicine consensus |
| **FT3 (pmol/L)** | 3.1-6.8 | **4.9-6.5** | Calculated from functional range |
| **Target for Optimal Metabolism** | - | **Upper 20-50% of reference range** | A4M, functional medicine practitioners |

**Key Differences from Conventional Ranges:**
- Functional medicine targets **upper half to upper third** of reference range
- Minimum threshold: >3.2 pg/mL (vs 2.0 pg/mL conventional)
- Optimal target: 3.5-4.2 pg/mL (upper 30-60% of range)
- Emphasizes adequate T3 for metabolic function, energy, cognitive performance, muscle maintenance

### Risk Stratification Levels

| Risk Level | FT3 Range (pg/mL) | FT3 Range (pmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <1.5 | <2.3 | Severe hypothyroidism, myxedema coma risk; severe nonthyroidal illness syndrome; immediate evaluation and treatment required. | <1.5 pg/mL: Medical emergency |
| **LOW** | 1.5-2.0 | 2.3-3.1 | Overt hypothyroidism or severe conversion dysfunction (low T3 syndrome); symptoms: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, depression, cognitive impairment; requires treatment. | <2.0 pg/mL: Below conventional range |
| **SUBOPTIMAL LOW** | 2.0-3.2 | 3.1-4.9 | Below functional medicine optimal; may indicate: impaired T4→T3 conversion, selenium deficiency, chronic stress, elevated reverse T3, liver/gut dysfunction; symptomatic despite "normal" range. | <3.2 pg/mL: Below functional medicine target |
| **OPTIMAL** | 3.2-4.2 | 4.9-6.5 | **Functional Medicine Optimal Range**; upper 20-60% of reference range; associated with optimal metabolic function, energy, cognitive performance, muscle mass, cardiovascular health. | 3.2-4.2 pg/mL: Core functional medicine target |
| **HIGH-NORMAL** | 4.2-5.0 | 6.5-7.7 | Upper range; generally favorable unless symptomatic (anxiety, palpitations, heat intolerance); monitor for hyperthyroidism if trending upward. | >4.2 pg/mL: Upper reference range |
| **ELEVATED** | 5.0-6.0 | 7.7-9.2 | Above most reference ranges; suggests hyperthyroidism, excessive T3 supplementation, or Graves' disease; check TSH (should be suppressed), thyroid antibodies (TRAb). | >5.0 pg/mL: Above most ranges |
| **CRITICAL HIGH** | >6.0 | >9.2 | Overt hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis; high risk of atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, thyroid storm; requires immediate anti-thyroid treatment and beta-blockade. | >6.0 pg/mL: Medical emergency threshold |

### Age and Sex-Specific Considerations

**Sex Differences:**
- **Men:** Significantly higher FT3 levels than women across all age groups
- **Men:** FT3 gradually but significantly decreases with age
- **Women:** FT3 lower than men; also decreases with age but less pronounced
- **Mechanism:** Testosterone enhances deiodinase activity (T4→T3 conversion); estrogen may inhibit deiodinases

**Age-Related Changes:**
- FT3 decreases progressively after age 40-50 in both sexes
- Elderly reference range: 3.68-5.47 pmol/L (2.40-3.56 pg/mL) - lower than younger adults
- Age-related decline in FT3 associated with frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline

**Special Population Ranges:**
- **Elderly (>65 years):** Reference range shifts downward; median ~3.0 pg/mL
- **Athletes/Highly active:** May have FT3 upper range (4.0-4.4 pg/mL) for optimal performance
- **Chronic illness:** FT3 often low-normal (2.5-3.2 pg/mL) due to nonthyroidal illness syndrome

### Reverse T3 (rT3) and FT3:rT3 Ratio

**Critical Context:** FT3 must be interpreted alongside reverse T3 (rT3) to assess thyroid hormone conversion efficiency.

**Reverse T3 (rT3):**
- **Conventional range:** 9-25 ng/dL (0.14-0.38 nmol/L)
- **Functional medicine optimal:** <15 ng/dL (<0.23 nmol/L)
- **Mechanism:** Inactive metabolite of T4; competes with T3 for cellular receptors; increased in stress, illness, inflammation

**FT3:rT3 Ratio (Critical Biomarker):**
- **Calculation:** FT3 (pg/mL) ÷ rT3 (ng/dL) × 100 = ratio
  - Alternative: FT3 (pg/dL) ÷ rT3 (ng/dL) = ratio
- **Conventional range:** 2.0-28.0
- **Optimal range (OptimalDX):** 10.0-28.0
- **Preferred target:** >10:1 (some practitioners prefer >12:1)

**Clinical Significance of FT3:rT3 Ratio:**
- **Ratio <10:** Impaired T4→T3 conversion; elevated rT3 dominance; symptoms of hypothyroidism despite normal TSH/FT4
- **Causes of low ratio:** Chronic stress, cortisol excess, selenium deficiency, zinc deficiency, iron deficiency, liver dysfunction, chronic inflammation, starvation/caloric restriction, critical illness
- **Treatment:** Address underlying cause (stress reduction, nutrient repletion), consider T3 supplementation, selenium 200 mcg/day

**Optimal Metabolism Definition:**
- FT3 in upper 20% of normal range
- Total T3:rT3 ratio between 10-15:1
- Associated with large reductions in chronic diseases

### FT3:FT4 Ratio (Conversion Efficiency)

**Critical Biomarker for Thyroid Hormone Conversion:**

**Calculation:** FT3 (pg/mL) ÷ FT4 (ng/dL) = ratio
- **Example:** FT3 3.2 pg/mL ÷ FT4 1.2 ng/dL = 2.67

**Optimal Range:**
- **Conventional range:** 2.2-2.9
- **Optimal range (OptimalDX):** 2.4-2.7
- **Target:** 2.5-2.7 for most patients

**Clinical Significance:**

| FT3:FT4 Ratio | Clinical Interpretation | Associated Conditions |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **<2.1** | Severely impaired T4→T3 conversion | Poor cardiovascular outcomes post-MI; increased major adverse cardiac events; selenium deficiency; low muscle mass; decreased muscle strength |
| **2.1-2.4** | Suboptimal conversion | T4 monotherapy; decreased deiodinase activity; nutrient deficiencies (selenium, zinc, iron); chronic stress |
| **2.4-2.7** | **OPTIMAL** | Efficient thyroid hormone conversion; optimal metabolic function; best cardiovascular outcomes |
| **2.7-3.0** | High-normal conversion | Generally favorable; may indicate high deiodinase activity; monitor for hyperthyroidism if symptoms present |
| **>3.0** | Excessive T3 relative to T4 | Hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease, toxic nodule); excessive T3 supplementation; increased cardiovascular risk; arterial stiffness; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome (50-80% higher risk in highest quartile) |

**Clinical Use:**
- **Low ratio (<2.4):** Add T3 supplementation (liothyronine, desiccated thyroid); correct nutrient deficiencies; address chronic stress
- **Normal ratio (2.4-2.7):** Continue current thyroid management; optimize nutrition
- **High ratio (>2.7):** Reduce T3 dose if supplementing; rule out hyperthyroidism; monitor cardiovascular risk

### Key Evidence (2023-2026)

**Cardiovascular Studies:**
- **2024 meta-analyses:** Higher FT3 within normal range associated with better cardiovascular outcomes; low FT3 predicts heart failure, increased mortality
- **Post-MI studies:** FT3:FT4 ratio <2.1 associated with significantly worse outcomes after myocardial infarction
- **Atrial fibrillation:** High FT3 (>5.0 pg/mL) in hyperthyroidism increases AF risk; within-normal high FT3 not independently associated with AF

**Metabolic Studies:**
- **FT3 and body composition:** Higher FT3 associated with greater muscle mass, muscle strength, better physical performance
- **Low T3 syndrome:** FT3 <2.5 pg/mL in chronic illness associated with increased mortality
- **Insulin resistance:** Low FT3:FT4 ratio associated with metabolic syndrome; high ratio (>3.0) also associated (U-shaped in metabolic context)

**Optimal Metabolism Research:**
- **Oatext 2024:** Optimal Metabolism defined by FT3 in upper 20% of normal range with T3:rT3 ratio 10-15:1 associated with large reductions in chronic diseases
- **Deiodinase studies:** Selenium, zinc, iron essential cofactors for deiodinase enzymes converting T4→T3

**Functional Medicine Sources:**
- **OptimalDX:** FT3:rT3 ratio optimal 10.0-28.0; FT3:FT4 ratio optimal 2.4-2.7
- **Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM):** Emphasizes comprehensive thyroid assessment including FT3, rT3, ratios, not just TSH
- **Rupa Health 2024:** Functional medicine approach prioritizes FT3 as most important thyroid marker for metabolic health
- **Dr. Amy Myers MD:** FT3 >3.2 pg/mL recommended; upper half of range optimal
- **A4M (Anti-Aging Medicine):** FT3 upper 20-40% of range target for longevity and optimal function

### Special Considerations

**Context Dependencies:**

1. **Thyroid Hormone Replacement:**
   - **Levothyroxine (T4) monotherapy:** FT3 may be mid-to-low range; if symptomatic, consider adding T3
   - **T4/T3 combination therapy:** Target FT3 upper half of range (3.5-4.2 pg/mL)
   - **T3-only or desiccated thyroid:** FT3 may be upper range; monitor for symptoms of excess (anxiety, palpitations)
   - **Timing:** FT3 peaks 2-4 hours after T3 dose; measure as trough (before morning dose) for accurate assessment

2. **Nonthyroidal Illness Syndrome (NTIS):**
   - Acute illness: FT3 low (2.0-2.8 pg/mL), TSH normal/low, FT4 normal/high
   - Mechanism: Decreased deiodinase activity, increased rT3
   - Management: Supportive care; thyroid hormone replacement NOT indicated; FT3 normalizes with recovery

3. **Chronic Stress and Cortisol:**
   - Elevated cortisol inhibits 5'-deiodinase (T4→T3 conversion)
   - Results in low FT3, high rT3, low FT3:rT3 ratio despite normal TSH/FT4
   - Management: Stress reduction, adaptogenic herbs, address cortisol dysregulation

4. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
   - **Selenium deficiency:** Impairs deiodinase function; FT3 low, rT3 high
   - **Zinc deficiency:** Reduces T4→T3 conversion
   - **Iron deficiency:** Impairs thyroid peroxidase and deiodinase enzymes
   - **Management:** Selenium 200 mcg/day, zinc 15-30 mg/day, iron repletion if deficient

5. **Liver and Gut Dysfunction:**
   - 20% of T4→T3 conversion occurs in liver
   - 20% of T4→T3 conversion occurs in gut (via gut microbiome)
   - Liver disease or dysbiosis impairs FT3 production
   - Management: Optimize liver function, probiotic support, gut healing protocols

**Common Confounders:**

| Confounder | Effect on FT3 | Mechanism | Management |
|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Biotin (>5 mg/day)** | Falsely HIGH | Competitive immunoassay interference | Stop 3-7 days before testing |
| **Acute illness** | Low (1.8-2.5 pg/mL) | Nonthyroidal illness syndrome; decreased conversion | Supportive care; retest after recovery |
| **Chronic stress** | Low (2.0-3.0 pg/mL) | Cortisol inhibits deiodinase | Stress management, adaptogens |
| **Caloric restriction** | Low | Adaptive thermogenesis; increased rT3 | Adequate caloric intake, refeed |
| **Beta-blockers** | Low | Inhibit 5'-deiodinase (T4→T3 conversion) | Expected effect; consider if symptomatic |
| **Selenium deficiency** | Low | Deiodinase cofactor | Selenium 200 mcg/day |
| **Liver disease** | Low | Decreased hepatic conversion | Optimize liver function |
| **Chronic inflammation** | Low | Cytokines inhibit deiodinase | Anti-inflammatory interventions |
| **Time since T3 dose** | Variable | Peak 2-4h post-dose | Measure as trough (before AM dose) |

**Clinical Interpretation Notes:**

| Clinical Scenario | TSH | FT4 | FT3 | Interpretation |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|
| Normal thyroid function | Normal | Normal | Normal (3.0-4.2) | Optimal if FT3 upper half of range |
| Primary hypothyroidism | High | Low | Low | Levothyroxine treatment indicated |
| T4→T3 conversion issue | Normal | Normal | Low (2.0-3.0) | Check rT3, FT3:rT3 ratio; consider T3 supplementation |
| Low T3 syndrome (NTIS) | Normal/Low | Normal/High | Low (1.8-2.8) | Acute illness; supportive care only |
| T4 monotherapy (suboptimal) | Normal | Normal/High | Low-normal (2.5-3.2) | May benefit from adding T3 if symptomatic |
| Hyperthyroidism | Low/Suppressed | High | High (>5.0) | Anti-thyroid treatment required |
| T3 toxicosis | Low/Suppressed | Normal/Low | High (>5.0) | Excessive T3 supplementation; reduce dose |
| Optimal on combination therapy | Normal | Normal | Upper half (3.5-4.2) | Continue current regimen |

## 4. Thyroid Panel Integration: The Big Picture

### Comprehensive Thyroid Assessment

**Functional Medicine Principle:** TSH alone is inadequate. A comprehensive thyroid panel includes:

1. **TSH** - Pituitary response to thyroid hormone levels
2. **Free T4** - Primary thyroid hormone output; prohormone
3. **Free T3** - Active thyroid hormone; metabolically active form
4. **Reverse T3** - Inactive metabolite; marker of conversion efficiency and stress
5. **Thyroid Antibodies:**
   - TPO Ab (thyroid peroxidase antibodies) - Hashimoto's thyroiditis
   - Tg Ab (thyroglobulin antibodies) - Hashimoto's thyroiditis
   - TRAb (TSH receptor antibodies) - Graves' disease

6. **Calculated Ratios:**
   - **FT3:FT4 ratio** - Conversion efficiency (optimal 2.4-2.7)
   - **FT3:rT3 ratio** - Metabolic efficiency (optimal >10:1)

- **Management:** Endocrinology referral; brain MRI; check other pituitary hormones; levothyroxine treatment guided by FT4, NOT TSH

### Relationship Between TSH, FT4, and FT3

**Feedback Loop:**
1. **Hypothalamus** → TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone)
2. **Pituitary** → TSH (stimulated by TRH, inhibited by T4/T3)
3. **Thyroid gland** → T4 (85-90%) and T3 (10-15%)
4. **Peripheral tissues** → T4→T3 conversion by deiodinases (type 1, type 2)
5. **Negative feedback:** T4 and T3 inhibit TSH release

**Key Relationships:**
- **Inverse relationship:** TSH ↓ when FT4/FT3 ↑; TSH ↑ when FT4/FT3 ↓
- **Log-linear relationship:** Small changes in FT4 cause large changes in TSH
- **TSH is most sensitive:** 0.1 ng/dL change in FT4 causes ~2 mIU/L change in TSH
- **FT3 provides feedback:** T3 suppresses TSH more potently than T4 (ratio ~3:1)

**Discordant Patterns (Red Flags):**
- **TSH normal, FT4 low:** Central hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic failure)
- **TSH high, FT4 normal/high:** TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (rare), thyroid hormone resistance
- **TSH normal, FT4 high:** Biotin interference, assay interference, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia
- **TSH low, FT4 normal, FT3 high:** T3 toxicosis, excessive T3 supplementation

### Optimal Ratios Summary

| Ratio | Calculation | Optimal Range | Clinical Significance |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **FT3:FT4** | FT3 (pg/mL) ÷ FT4 (ng/dL) | 2.4-2.7 | T4→T3 conversion efficiency; optimal metabolic function |
| **FT3:rT3** | FT3 (pg/mL) ÷ rT3 (ng/dL) × 100 | 10.0-28.0 (>12:1 preferred) | Thyroid hormone bioavailability; metabolic efficiency |
| **Total T3:rT3** | Total T3 (ng/dL) ÷ rT3 (ng/dL) | 10-15:1 | Optimal metabolism definition |

### Age-Adjusted Interpretation

**Young Adults (20-40 years):**
- Use standard functional medicine optimal ranges
- TSH target: 1.0-2.5 mIU/L
- FT4 target: 1.1-1.5 ng/dL
- FT3 target: 3.5-4.2 pg/mL

**Middle-Aged Adults (40-60 years):**
- Slight upward adjustment in TSH acceptable (up to 3.0 mIU/L if asymptomatic)
- FT4: Stable across ages
- FT3: May decline slightly; maintain >3.2 pg/mL

**Older Adults (>60 years):**
- TSH upper limit adjusted: Use age/10 formula (e.g., 70 years → 7.0 mIU/L upper limit)
- Avoid overdiagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism
- FT3: Expected to be lower (2.8-3.5 pg/mL); focus on symptom correlation
- Treatment threshold: TSH >10 mIU/L or symptomatic with TSH >7.0 mIU/L

**Elderly (>80 years):**
- TSH median ~2.57 mIU/L (range 0.86-7.56)
- Most patients with TSH 4.5-7.0 do NOT require treatment
- Treatment only if TSH >10, significantly symptomatic, or cardiovascular risk

## 5. Testing Considerations and Confounders

### Pre-Analytical Factors

#### Biotin Interference (CRITICAL)

**Prevalence:** 7.2% of US population takes >5 mg/day biotin (50-200x RDA)

**Mechanism:**
- Many immunoassays use biotin-streptavidin binding in reagent design
- **Competitive assays (FT4, FT3, Total T4):** Biotin causes **FALSELY HIGH** results
- **Sandwich assays (TSH):** Biotin causes **FALSELY LOW** results

**Clinical Impact:**
- Mimics hyperthyroidism: High FT4, High FT3, Low TSH
- Can lead to inappropriate diagnosis and treatment

**Management:**
- Ask patients about biotin/hair-skin-nail supplements
- Discontinue biotin **3-7 days** before thyroid testing (minimum 72 hours, but 7 days preferred for high doses)
- Alternative: Use LC-MS/MS (mass spectrometry) or Abbott platform (not affected by biotin)

**Platforms Affected vs Unaffected:**
- **Affected:** Roche, Siemens (biotin-streptavidin reagents)
- **Unaffected:** Abbott, LC-MS/MS (gold standard)

#### Timing and Circadian Variation

**TSH:**
- Peaks in early morning (2-4 AM): ~30-50% higher than afternoon
- Nadir in afternoon/evening (3-6 PM)
- **Recommendation:** Draw fasting AM sample (7-9 AM) for consistency
- If on levothyroxine: Measure BEFORE morning dose

**FT4:**
- Minimal circadian variation
- Stable throughout day
- If on levothyroxine: Measure BEFORE morning dose (trough level)

**FT3:**
- Minimal circadian variation for endogenous T3
- If on T3 or desiccated thyroid: Peaks 2-4 hours post-dose
- **Recommendation:** Measure BEFORE morning T3 dose (trough level)

#### Fasting vs Fed State

- **TSH:** No significant difference
- **FT4, FT3:** Minimal difference
- **Recommendation:** Fasting preferred for consistency and if other metabolic labs being drawn

#### Medication Timing

**Levothyroxine (T4):**
- Take AFTER blood draw
- If taken before: FT4 will be falsely elevated (peak ~2-4 hours)

**Liothyronine (T3) or Desiccated Thyroid:**
- Take AFTER blood draw
- If taken before: FT3 will be falsely elevated (peak ~2-4 hours)

**Biotin Supplements:**
- Discontinue 3-7 days before testing

### Common Medication Interactions

| Medication | Effect on TSH | Effect on FT4 | Effect on FT3 | Mechanism |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Biotin** | Falsely LOW | Falsely HIGH | Falsely HIGH | Immunoassay interference |
| **Levothyroxine** | Decrease | Increase | Increase (via conversion) | Hormone replacement |
| **Liothyronine (T3)** | Decrease | Normal/Decrease | Increase | Hormone replacement |
| **Amiodarone** | Increase or Decrease | Increase | Decrease | Inhibits deiodinase; iodine load |
| **Lithium** | Increase | Decrease | Decrease | Inhibits thyroid hormone release |
| **Corticosteroids** | Decrease | Decrease | Decrease | Inhibits TSH; inhibits deiodinase |
| **Dopamine** | Decrease | No change | No change | Inhibits TSH release |
| **Beta-blockers** | No change | No change | Decrease | Inhibits T4→T3 conversion |
| **Metformin** | Decrease | No change | No change | May decrease TSH via unknown mechanism |
| **Estrogen (oral)** | Increase TBG | Increase Total T4 | Increase Total T3 | Increases binding proteins; FT4/FT3 usually unchanged |
| **Selenium** | Decrease in Hashimoto's | No change | May increase | Improves deiodinase function; reduces inflammation |

### Nutrient Impact on Thyroid Function

**Essential Nutrients for Thyroid Hormone Production and Conversion:**

1. **Iodine**
   - RDA: 150 mcg/day
   - Deficiency: Hypothyroidism, goiter
   - Excess: Can trigger autoimmune thyroiditis
   - Testing: 24-hour urine iodine

2. **Selenium**
   - RDA: 55 mcg/day; Optimal: 100-200 mcg/day
   - Function: Deiodinase cofactor (T4→T3 conversion); antioxidant (protects thyroid from oxidative damage)
   - Deficiency: Low FT3, high rT3, impaired conversion
   - Supplementation: 200 mcg/day reduces TPO antibodies in Hashimoto's
   - Effect on tests: May decrease TSH, increase FT3 in deficiency states

3. **Zinc**
   - RDA: 11 mg/day (men), 8 mg/day (women)
   - Function: Deiodinase cofactor, thyroid hormone receptor function
   - Deficiency: Impaired T4→T3 conversion; low FT3

4. **Iron**
   - Function: Thyroid peroxidase cofactor; deiodinase cofactor
   - Deficiency: Impaired thyroid hormone synthesis; impaired T4→T3 conversion
   - Target: Ferritin >50-70 ng/mL for optimal thyroid function

5. **Vitamin D**
   - Function: Immune modulation; thyroid receptor expression
   - Deficiency: Associated with autoimmune thyroiditis
   - Target: 25-OH vitamin D >40 ng/mL (functional medicine optimal: 50-70 ng/mL)

6. **Vitamin A**
   - Function: Thyroid hormone receptor function
   - Deficiency: Impaired thyroid hormone action

**NOTE:** Nutrient deficiencies affect ACTUAL thyroid function (not test interference like biotin).

### Assay Method Considerations

**Immunoassays (Most Common):**
- Fast, automated, cost-effective
- Subject to interference: biotin, heterophile antibodies, autoantibodies
- Platform differences: Abbott, Roche, Siemens have different reference ranges

**LC-MS/MS (Mass Spectrometry):**
- Gold standard for accuracy
- Not affected by biotin, heterophile antibodies
- More expensive; not routinely available
- Use when: Discordant results, suspected assay interference, biotin use

**Equilibrium Dialysis (ED):**
- Gold standard for FT4, FT3 measurement
- Separates free from bound hormone
- Labor-intensive; not commonly used clinically

**Recommendation:** Know your lab's platform and reference ranges. When results don't match clinical picture, consider interference and retest on different platform or LC-MS/MS.

### When to Suspect Laboratory Interference

**Red Flags:**
1. **Discordant results:** High FT4, High FT3, Low TSH (but patient asymptomatic) → Suspect biotin
2. **Impossible results:** TSH and FT4 both high or both low (except rare conditions) → Suspect assay interference
3. **Results don't match clinical picture:** "Normal" labs but severe hypothyroid symptoms → Check FT3, rT3, antibodies
4. **Platform differences:** Results vary significantly when repeated on different platform → Assay-specific interference

**Actions:**
- Ask about biotin, supplements, recent contrast agents
- Repeat on different platform (Abbott if initially Roche)
- Consider LC-MS/MS for definitive measurement
- Check for heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factor (can interfere with immunoassays)

### Color-Coding Recommendations

| Risk Level | Color | Hex Code | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| CRITICAL LOW | Red (Dark) | #B71C1C | TSH <0.1, FT4 <0.5, FT3 <1.5 |
| LOW | Orange (Dark) | #E65100 | Below normal range |
| SUBOPTIMAL LOW | Orange (Light) | #FF9800 | Within normal but below optimal |
| OPTIMAL | Green | #4CAF50 | Functional medicine optimal range |
| EVIDENCE-BASED OPTIMAL | Green (Highlight) | #2E7D32 | Meta-analysis sweet spot (badge/star) |
| SUBOPTIMAL HIGH | Yellow/Amber | #FFC107 | Within normal but above optimal |
| ELEVATED | Orange (Dark) | #FF5722 | Above normal range |
| CRITICAL HIGH | Red (Dark) | #D32F2F | Medical emergency threshold |

### Clinical Alerts

**Generate alerts for:**
1. **TSH <0.1 OR >10.0** → "CRITICAL: Endocrine evaluation required"
2. **FT4 >2.3 ng/dL (>29.6 pmol/L)** → "CRITICAL: Evaluate for thyroid storm"
3. **FT3 <1.5 pg/mL** → "CRITICAL: Severe hypothyroidism or NTIS"
4. **Discordant results** (TSH normal + FT4 low) → "Consider central hypothyroidism"
5. **FT3:FT4 ratio <2.1** → "Impaired T4→T3 conversion; consider selenium, check rT3"
6. **Age-adjusted abnormal** → "TSH elevated for age; consider age-specific reference"

### Patient Education Auto-Text

**For OPTIMAL results:**
> "Your thyroid function is in the optimal range based on functional medicine guidelines. Continue current management."

**For SUBOPTIMAL HIGH TSH (2.5-4.5):**
> "Your TSH is within conventional normal range but above functional medicine optimal (1.0-2.5 mIU/L). This may indicate early thyroid underactivity. Consider comprehensive thyroid panel (FT4, FT3, thyroid antibodies) and symptom review. Many functional medicine practitioners address this proactively, especially if symptomatic."

**For LOW FT3 with NORMAL TSH/FT4:**
> "Your FT3 is below optimal despite normal TSH and FT4, suggesting impaired T4-to-T3 conversion. Possible causes: selenium/zinc deficiency, chronic stress, inflammation, liver/gut dysfunction. Consider checking reverse T3 (rT3) and FT3:rT3 ratio. Nutritional optimization may be beneficial."

**For BIOTIN interference suspected:**
> "Your results suggest possible biotin interference (high FT4, high FT3, low TSH). Are you taking biotin, hair-skin-nail supplements, or high-dose B-complex vitamins? If yes, discontinue for 7 days and retest."

### Longitudinal Trend Analysis

**Track over time:**
1. **TSH trend:** Increasing (early hypothyroidism), decreasing (hyperthyroidism or overtreatment)
2. **FT3 trend:** Decreasing (worsening conversion or hypothyroidism)
3. **FT3:FT4 ratio trend:** Decreasing (worsening conversion efficiency)
4. **Response to treatment:** Did TSH/FT4/FT3 move into optimal range?

**Visual display:**
- Line graph: TSH, FT4, FT3 over time with optimal range shading
- Ratio trends: FT3:FT4 and FT3:rT3 over time
- Color-coded table: Each value color-coded by risk level

### Clinical Decision Support Recommendations

**Based on pattern recognition:**

| Pattern | Auto-Recommendation |
|---------|---------------------|
| TSH 2.5-4.5, Symptomatic, TPO Ab+ | "Consider levothyroxine trial; recheck in 6-8 weeks" |
| TSH optimal, FT4 high-normal, FT3 low, FT3:FT4 <2.2 | "Check rT3, selenium, zinc; consider T3 supplementation" |
| TSH <0.4, FT4 high, FT3 high, Asymptomatic | "Rule out biotin interference; ask about supplements; repeat in 2-4 weeks off biotin" |
| TSH >10.0, FT4 low | "Initiate levothyroxine; recheck TSH/FT4 in 6-8 weeks; target TSH 1.0-2.5" |
| Age >70, TSH 4.5-7.0, Asymptomatic | "Age-adjusted normal; monitor; treatment not indicated unless symptomatic or TSH >age/10" |

## Implementation Notes

**Database Schema Considerations:**
1. Store TSH, FT4, FT3 with units (mIU/L, ng/dL or pmol/L, pg/mL or pmol/L)
2. Calculate and store ratios: FT3:FT4, FT3:rT3
3. Store risk level (text), risk score (numeric), color code (hex)
4. Flag age-adjusted interpretations separately
5. Store reference range source (conventional lab vs functional medicine optimal)

**Clinical Workflow Integration:**
1. Display conventional lab range AND functional medicine optimal range side-by-side
2. Visual indicator (badge/star) for "evidence-based optimal" range (60-80th percentile for TSH, 20-40th for FT4)
3. Auto-calculate ratios when FT3 and FT4 both present
4. Generate clinical alerts for critical values and discordant patterns
5. Longitudinal trend graph with optimal range shading
6. Patient-friendly summary with color-coding and interpretation

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Machine learning to predict thyroid dysfunction progression
2. Personalized optimal ranges based on patient age, sex, comorbidities
3. Integration with symptom tracking (fatigue, weight, temperature)
4. Automated treatment suggestions based on pattern recognition
5. Integration with nutrient testing (selenium, zinc, iron, vitamin D)
