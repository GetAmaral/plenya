## Scientific Articles Added

### 1. Chronic hepatitis B in 2025: diagnosis, treatment and future directions
- **Authors:** Watson AG, Mulay AS, Gill US
- **Journal:** Clinical Medicine (London)
- **Publication Date:** November 4, 2025
- **Type:** Review
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12681808/

**Key Findings:**
- Most recent (2025) clinical guidelines on hepatitis B diagnosis
- Emphasizes anti-HBc role in serological pattern interpretation
- Highlights diagnostic pitfall: isolated anti-HBc positivity (typically past exposure, management only if immunosuppression planned)
- Distinguishes anti-HBc IgM (acute infection) from IgG (chronic/resolved)
- Reactivation risk in immunosuppressed patients, particularly with B-cell depleting agents

### 2. Hepatitis B Core Antibody Level: A Surrogate Marker for Host Antiviral Immunity
- **Authors:** Multiple authors
- **Journal:** Viruses
- **Publication Date:** May 3, 2023
- **Type:** Research Article
- **DOI:** 10.3390/v15051111
- **PMID:** PMC10221631
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10221631/

**Key Findings:**
- Quantitative anti-HBc (qAnti-HBc) as universal anti-HBV immune surrogate
- Immune-active phase patients show ~10-fold higher levels vs immune-tolerant phase
- Positive correlation with ALT activity and histological inflammation severity
- Cut-off ~4.5 log10 IU/mL for moderate-to-severe inflammation in normal-ALT patients
- Baseline >4.0-4.5 log10 IU/mL predicts HBeAg seroconversion with antivirals

### 3. Clinical Significance and Remaining Issues of Anti-HBc Antibody
- **Authors:** Multiple authors
- **Journal:** Diagnostics (Basel)
- **Publication Date:** March 29, 2024
- **Type:** Review
- **DOI:** 10.3390/diagnostics14070728
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011781/

**Key Findings:**
- Anti-HBc appears early and persists lifelong (crucial for blood safety screening)
- Major challenge: lack of standardization across assay systems (ELISA, CMIA, CLIA, CLEIA)
- Results in different units (IU/mL, INH%, S/O) complicate interpretation
- Difficulty distinguishing low-titer true positives from false positives
- Quantitative anti-HBc predicts treatment response, carcinogenesis risk, reactivation

### 4. Occult Hepatitis B Virus Infection: An Update
- **Authors:** Saitta C, Pollicino T, Raimondo G
- **Journal:** Viruses
- **Publication Date:** July 8, 2022
- **Type:** Review
- **DOI:** 10.3390/v14071504
- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9318873/

**Key Findings:**
- Occult HBV infection (OBI): HBsAg-negative with replication-competent HBV DNA in liver
- Seropositive OBI (~80%): anti-HBc/anti-HBs detectable
- Seronegative OBI (~20%): all markers absent
- Anti-HBc as surrogate marker for OBI screening (blood donors, organ recipients, immunosuppressed)
- Reactivation risk up to 40% with immunosuppression
  - High risk (>10%): anti-CD20 therapies
  - Moderate risk (1-10%): chemotherapy, TNF-α inhibitors
- OBI accelerates cirrhosis, maintains oncogenic potential (HBV integration in 75% OBI-HCC cases)
- Prophylactic antivirals recommended for high-risk immunosuppression

## Clinical Content Summary

### Clinical Relevance (2,159 chars)
Comprehensive explanation covering:
- Anti-HBc as lifetime marker (IgM vs IgG differentiation)
- Isolated anti-HBc interpretation challenges (past infection, OBI, window period, false-positive)

- European guidelines for prophylactic antiviral therapy
- OBI oncogenic potential and transmission risks
- Assay standardization limitations

### Patient Explanation (2,051 chars)
Patient-friendly Portuguese text explaining:
- What anti-HBc antibody represents ("memory" of HBV exposure)
- IgM vs IgG differences in simple terms
- Isolated anti-HBc positivity meaning and possibilities
- Quantitative measurement importance (correlation with immune activity)
- Critical information for patients planning immunosuppressive therapy
- Reactivation risk with specific medications (e.g., rituximab up to 40%)
- Need for prophylactic antivirals in certain scenarios
- Reassurance that positive result doesn't always mean active disease

### Clinical Conduct (3,974 chars)
Detailed protocols including:
- **CDC 2025 triple panel interpretation** (HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc)
- **Four main serological patterns** with specific management
- **Isolated anti-HBc protocol** (step-by-step investigation)
- **Reactivation risk stratification** for immunosuppression:
  - High risk (>10%): anti-CD20, stem cell transplant → mandatory prophylaxis
  - Moderate risk (1-10%): chemotherapy, TNF-α inhibitors → pre-emptive monitoring
  - Low risk (<1%): DAAs, moderate immunosuppressors → trimestral monitoring
- **Quantitative anti-HBc interpretation** (cut-off values, clinical utility)
- **OBI investigation indications** (transplant candidates, cryptogenic hepatitis, HCC)
- **Longitudinal follow-up protocols** (resolved infection, isolated anti-HBc)
- **Documentation requirements** for electronic medical records
