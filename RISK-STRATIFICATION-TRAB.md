# TRAb (TSH Receptor Antibodies) - Risk Stratification for Functional Integrative Medicine

**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Document Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

**TRAb (Thyrotropin Receptor Antibodies)** are autoantibodies directed against the TSH receptor on thyroid follicular cells. They are the primary diagnostic marker for Graves' disease and play a critical role in monitoring disease activity, predicting remission, and assessing fetal/neonatal risk in pregnancy.

---

## Risk Curve Type

**PRIMARY CURVE: LINEAR (Unidirectional)**

**Rationale:**
- TRAb risk increases proportionally with rising antibody levels
- Higher TRAb titers correlate with:
  - Increased disease severity
  - Higher relapse risk after treatment cessation
  - Longer treatment duration required
  - Greater risk of fetal/neonatal thyrotoxicosis
- Negative/undetectable levels are optimal
- There is no "too low" threshold - lower is always better

**Special Consideration:**
While the overall curve is LINEAR for stimulating antibodies (TSAb), there exists a clinical distinction between:
- **Stimulating TRAb (TSAb):** Cause hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease)
- **Blocking TRAb (TBAb):** Cause hypothyroidism (atrophic thyroiditis)
- **Neutral TRAb:** No functional impact

These different antibody types can coexist in the same patient, creating complex clinical presentations. However, standard TRAb assays measure total binding antibodies and do not distinguish between these functional types.

---

## Optimal Range (Functional Medicine 2023-2026)

### Standard Laboratory Reference Range
- **Negative (Normal):** ≤1.75 IU/L
- **Positive (Abnormal):** >1.75 IU/L

### Functional Medicine Optimal Range
**Target: <1.0 IU/L (Undetectable)**

**Rationale:**
- Functional medicine aims for complete antibody negativity
- Even "low positive" levels (1.76-3.0 IU/L) indicate active autoimmune process
- Levels <1.0 IU/L associated with:
  - Lowest relapse risk in Graves' disease
  - Optimal remission outcomes
  - Minimal fetal risk in pregnancy
  - Reduced thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy progression

### Clinical Decision Thresholds

| TRAb Level (IU/L) | Clinical Significance |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| <1.0 | Optimal - No detectable antibodies |
| 1.0-1.75 | Gray zone - Monitor closely, may indicate early/subclinical disease |
| 1.76-3.0 | Mildly elevated - Confirm with repeat testing |
| 3.0-10.0 | Moderately elevated - Active disease, moderate relapse risk |
| 10.0-20.0 | Significantly elevated - High relapse risk, prolonged treatment needed |
| >20.0 | Severely elevated - Very high relapse risk, consider definitive therapy |

### Pregnancy-Specific Thresholds
- **<1.75 IU/L:** Low risk - Routine prenatal care
- **1.75-5.4 IU/L (1-3× ULN):** Moderate risk - Increased fetal monitoring
- **>5.4 IU/L (>3× ULN):** High risk - Intensive fetal/neonatal monitoring required
- **>7.7 IU/L (>4.4× ULN):** Very high risk - Documented lowest level causing neonatal thyrotoxicosis

---

## Primary Unit & Conversions

### Primary Unit
**IU/L (International Units per Liter)**

This is the standardized unit used by most third-generation TRAb assays, including:
- Roche Elecsys TRAb (reference standard)
- Abbott Alinity i TRAb
- Siemens Immulite TSI

### Alternative Units

| Unit | Conversion | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| U/L | 1 IU/L = 1 U/L | Functionally identical |
| % inhibition | Varies by assay | Older competitive binding assays |
| TSI index | Varies by assay | TSI (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin) bioassay |
| Specimen/Control ratio | Varies by assay | Some functional bioassays |

### TSI (Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin) Specific Cutoffs
- **Negative:** <0.55 IU/L
- **Positive:** ≥0.55 IU/L
- **Note:** TSI measures only stimulating antibodies, whereas TRAb measures all binding antibodies

### Assay-Specific Cutoffs (2024 Data)

| Assay Method | Manufacturer | Cutoff | Sensitivity | Specificity |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Elecsys TRAb | Roche | 1.75 IU/L | 96-97% | 99% |
| Immulite TSI | Siemens | 0.55 IU/L | 94.0% | 95-97% |
| Alinity i TRAb | Abbott | 1.75 IU/L | 96% | 98% |
| EliA anti-TSH-R | Thermo Fisher | 3.2 IU/L | 96.6% | 99.4% |
| Kryptor TRAK | Brahms | 0.9 IU/L | Variable | Variable |

## Risk Stratification Levels

### Level 1: Optimal (Functional Medicine Target)
**Range:** <1.0 IU/L
**Clinical Significance:**
- No detectable TSH receptor antibodies
- Optimal thyroid immune health
- Lowest relapse risk in treated Graves' disease (<10% at 2 years)
- No fetal/neonatal risk in pregnancy
- Target level for sustained remission

**Functional Medicine Actions:**
- Maintain current lifestyle/treatment
- Annual monitoring if history of Graves' disease
- No pregnancy restrictions

---

### Level 2: Low Risk / Gray Zone
**Range:** 1.0-1.75 IU/L
**Clinical Significance:**
- Technically "negative" but approaching detection threshold
- May indicate:
  - Subclinical autoimmune process
  - Early Graves' disease
  - Incomplete remission
  - Assay variability
- 15-25% relapse risk at 2 years in treated patients

**Functional Medicine Actions:**
- Repeat testing in 3-6 months
- Comprehensive thyroid panel (TSH, Free T4, Free T3, TPO, TG antibodies)
- Assess for subclinical symptoms
- Optimize nutrition (selenium, zinc, vitamin D)
- Address triggers (stress, gut health, environmental toxins)
- More frequent monitoring in pregnancy (monthly)

---

### Level 3: Mild Elevation
**Range:** 1.76-3.0 IU/L
**Clinical Significance:**
- Confirmed positive TRAb
- Mild active autoimmune process
- Possible early/mild Graves' disease
- 25-40% relapse risk at 2 years post-treatment
- Low-moderate fetal risk in pregnancy

**Functional Medicine Actions:**
- Confirm diagnosis with full thyroid panel
- Evaluate for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy
- Initiate or continue antithyroid drugs
- Aggressive lifestyle interventions:
  - Anti-inflammatory diet
  - Stress management (cortisol impacts thyroid)
  - Gut healing protocols (leaky gut → autoimmunity)
  - Environmental toxin reduction
- Repeat TRAb every 3 months during treatment
- Pregnancy: Fetal ultrasound at 20-24 weeks, repeat TRAb at 24-28 weeks

---

### Level 4: Moderate Elevation
**Range:** 3.0-10.0 IU/L
**Clinical Significance:**
- Active Graves' disease
- Moderate disease severity
- 40-60% relapse risk at 2 years after antithyroid drug cessation
- Moderate fetal/neonatal risk (if >3× ULN = >5.4 IU/L)
- Requires 18-30 months average treatment duration

**Functional Medicine Actions:**
- Antithyroid drugs (methimazole or PTU)
- Consider beta-blockers for symptom control
- Intensive integrative protocol:
  - Selenium supplementation (200 mcg/day) - reduces antibodies
  - L-carnitine (2-4g/day) - blocks thyroid hormone effects
  - Bugleweed/lemon balm (if tolerated) - herbal antithyroid effects
  - Omega-3 fatty acids - anti-inflammatory
- Monthly TRAb monitoring during treatment
- Continue treatment until TRAb <1.75 IU/L × 6-12 months
- Pregnancy: Intensive fetal monitoring, consider neonatology consult

**Key Evidence:**
- TRAb >3.85 IU/L at treatment cessation predicts >90% relapse risk
- TRAb persistently >7.5 IU/L at 12 months indicates treatment failure

---

### Level 5: High Elevation
**Range:** 10.0-20.0 IU/L
**Clinical Significance:**
- Severe active Graves' disease
- High disease burden
- 60-84% relapse risk at 2-4 years post-treatment
- Persistent TRAb positivity likely (only 52-75% achieve negativity by 48 months)
- Requires 30-50 months average treatment duration
- High fetal/neonatal risk - intensive monitoring mandatory

**Functional Medicine Actions:**
- Long-term antithyroid drug therapy (24-60 months minimum)
- Consider definitive therapy (radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy) if:
  - Patient preference
  - Poor medication compliance
  - Severe adverse effects
  - Planning pregnancy (requires stable hypothyroidism)
- Maximal integrative support (as Level 4 + additional):
  - Address root causes: chronic infections (EBV, Yersinia), heavy metals, chronic stress
  - Consider low-dose naltrexone (LDN) - modulates immune function
  - Vitamin D optimization (50-80 ng/mL)
- Monthly TRAb + thyroid function monitoring
- Pregnancy: Weekly fetal monitoring, likely requires antithyroid drugs, neonatology team involvement

**Prognostic Thresholds:**
- TRAb >10.90 IU/L predicts persistent antibody positivity at 24 months
- TRAb >16.01 IU/L at diagnosis predicts relapse with 76% sensitivity

---

### Level 6: Very High Elevation / Refractory Disease
**Range:** >20.0 IU/L
**Clinical Significance:**
- Very severe, highly active Graves' disease
- >84% relapse risk with antithyroid drugs alone
- Only 12.7% achieve TRAb negativity by 24 months, 52.7% by 48 months
- Requires 50+ months average treatment duration
- Very high risk of:
  - Treatment failure
  - Thyroid storm (rare but life-threatening)
  - Severe thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy
  - Fetal/neonatal thyrotoxicosis (almost certain if pregnant)

**Functional Medicine Actions:**
- **Strongly consider definitive therapy** (RAI or surgery)
- If continuing medical management:
  - Aggressive antithyroid drugs (often higher doses)
  - Block-and-replace regimen (block thyroid + give levothyroxine)
  - Prolonged treatment (48-60+ months)
  - Very frequent monitoring (every 4-6 weeks)
- Maximum integrative support (all Level 5 interventions)
- Ophthalmology referral for eye disease monitoring
- **Pregnancy:**
  - High-risk maternal-fetal medicine referral
  - Antithyroid drugs throughout pregnancy
  - Weekly fetal ultrasounds in 2nd/3rd trimester
  - Plan delivery at tertiary care center with NICU
  - Cord blood TRAb at delivery
  - Neonatal thyroid function testing at days 3-5, even if asymptomatic

**Critical Evidence:**
- At these levels, traditional 12-18 month treatment courses have <20% success rate
- TRAb >46.5 IU/L at diagnosis associated with treatment failure (sensitivity 52%, specificity 78%)
- Long-term remission rates with antithyroid drugs alone: <20%

---

## CRITICAL Context

### 1. Graves' Disease Diagnosis
- **Primary diagnostic marker** for Graves' disease
- Sensitivity: 92-97%
- Specificity: 96-99%
- TRAb differentiates Graves' from other hyperthyroidism causes:
  - Toxic multinodular goiter (TRAb negative)
  - Toxic adenoma (TRAb negative)
  - Subacute thyroiditis (TRAb negative)
  - Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (TRAb negative)

### 2. Graves' Disease Remission Monitoring
**Critical Role:** TRAb is the **best predictor** of remission and relapse risk

**Key Monitoring Timepoints:**
- **Baseline (at diagnosis):** Establishes disease severity
  - TRAb <10 IU/L: 63% remission rate
  - TRAb >10 IU/L: 39% remission rate

- **6 months into treatment:**
  - TRAb decrease <52.3% from baseline: 79% will never achieve permanent remission

- **12 months into treatment:**
  - TRAb >7.5 IU/L: >90% relapse risk

- **At treatment cessation (12-24 months):**
  - TRAb >3.85 IU/L: >90% relapse risk
  - TRAb <1.75 IU/L: <30% relapse risk

- **Long-term follow-up:**
  - TRAb negativity at 24 months: 90-99% sustained remission
  - TRAb persistently positive at 24 months: 70-84% relapse within 2-4 years

**2024 Evidence:**
- Lower TRAb titers at diagnosis are **independent predictors of remission** (OR 1.287, p=0.005)
- Dynamic TRAb monitoring (pattern of change) more predictive than single values
- Prolonged antithyroid drug treatment (60+ months) increases remission rates to 90%

### 3. Differentiation from Other Thyroid Antibodies

| Antibody | Target | Primary Disease | Diagnostic Use |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **TRAb** | TSH Receptor | Graves' disease | Diagnosis, remission prediction |
| **TPO (Anti-TPO)** | Thyroid Peroxidase | Hashimoto's thyroiditis | Autoimmune hypothyroidism |
| **TG (Anti-Tg)** | Thyroglobulin | Hashimoto's, thyroid cancer monitoring | Autoimmune disease, cancer surveillance |

**Critical Distinctions:**
- **TRAb** is highly specific for Graves' disease
- TPO/TG antibodies can be positive in:
  - Hashimoto's thyroiditis (very common)
  - Graves' disease (50-70% also have TPO/TG antibodies)
  - Normal population (5-10% have low-level antibodies)
- **Clinical Pearl:** Hyperthyroidism + TRAb positive = Graves' disease (>95% specificity)
- **Clinical Pearl:** Hypothyroidism + TPO/TG positive = Hashimoto's (TRAb usually negative)

### 4. Blocking vs Stimulating TRAb

**Standard TRAb Assays (Binding Assays):**
- Measure **total binding antibodies** (stimulating + blocking + neutral)
- **Cannot distinguish** between antibody types
- Most commonly used in clinical practice (Roche, Abbott, Siemens)

**Functional Bioassays (TSI/TBI):**
- Measure **functional activity**
- Can differentiate:
  - **TSI (Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin):** Stimulating antibodies
  - **TBI (Thyroid-Blocking Immunoglobulin):** Blocking antibodies
- More expensive, less widely available
- **When to order:**
  - Atypical presentations (hyperthyroidism alternating with hypothyroidism)
  - Pregnancy with Graves' disease (TSI more predictive of fetal risk)
  - Unexplained hypothyroidism with positive TRAb

**Clinical Presentations:**

| Antibody Type | Thyroid Function | Typical Disease |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Stimulating (TSAb/TSI) | Hyperthyroidism | Graves' disease (>95%) |
| Blocking (TBAb/TBI) | Hypothyroidism | Atrophic thyroiditis, some Hashimoto's |
| Mixed (Both present) | Variable, alternating | Atypical autoimmune thyroid disease |
| Neutral | Normal | Subclinical disease, remission |

**Important Clinical Scenarios:**
1. **Graves' disease with spontaneous hypothyroidism:**
   - May represent switch from stimulating to blocking antibodies
   - Order functional bioassay (TSI/TBI)

2. **Hashimoto's with positive TRAb:**
   - Usually blocking antibodies (TBAb)
   - Causes thyroid atrophy (vs. goiter in TPO-driven Hashimoto's)

3. **Pregnancy considerations:**
   - Blocking antibodies can cause fetal/neonatal hypothyroidism
   - Stimulating antibodies cause fetal/neonatal hyperthyroidism
   - Both can coexist - functional bioassay recommended

### 5. Pregnancy Considerations

**Why TRAb Matters in Pregnancy:**
- TRAb antibodies **cross the placenta** (IgG class)
- Can affect fetal thyroid starting at 20-24 weeks gestation
- Risk exists even if mother is euthyroid after RAI or thyroidectomy

**ATA 2024 Guidelines - TRAb Monitoring in Pregnancy:**

1. **Who to test:**
   - Current Graves' disease
   - History of Graves' disease (even if treated with RAI/surgery)
   - Taking or recently stopped antithyroid drugs
   - History of delivering infant with thyroid dysfunction

2. **When to test:**
   - **First prenatal visit** (confirm pregnancy)
   - **24-28 weeks gestation** (critical window for fetal thyroid development)
   - **If initial TRAb >3× ULN:** Repeat at 18-22 and 30-34 weeks

3. **Risk stratification:**

| Maternal TRAb (IU/L) | Risk Level | Fetal Monitoring | Neonatal Risk |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| <1.75 | Low | Routine prenatal care | Minimal - cord blood TRAb, if negative → routine care |
| 1.75-5.4 (1-3× ULN) | Moderate | Fetal ultrasound q4-6 weeks from 20 weeks | Moderate - cord blood + TFTs day 3-5 |
| >5.4 (>3× ULN) | High | Weekly fetal ultrasound, consider fetal heart rate monitoring | High - NICU delivery, cord blood, serial TFTs day 1, 3-5, 7-10 |
| >7.7 (documented lowest causing neonatal thyrotoxicosis) | Very High | Intensive surveillance, maternal-fetal medicine, may need fetal blood sampling | Very high - tertiary NICU, endocrinology consult, may need antithyroid drugs |

4. **Fetal monitoring signs of thyrotoxicosis:**
   - Fetal tachycardia (>170 bpm sustained)
   - Fetal goiter (visible on ultrasound)
   - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
   - Polyhydramnios
   - Advanced bone age
   - Hydrops fetalis (severe cases)

5. **Neonatal thyrotoxicosis:**
   - Occurs in 1-5% of pregnancies with Graves' disease
   - Can be **delayed** if mother on antithyroid drugs (drugs suppress fetal thyroid, then wear off after birth)
   - Symptoms: irritability, poor weight gain, tachycardia, poor feeding, jaundice
   - **Critical:** Even if infant appears normal at birth, must check TFTs if at-risk
   - Treatment: Methimazole or PTU (if needed), beta-blockers, supportive care
   - Duration: Typically resolves by 3-6 months as maternal antibodies clear

6. **Special scenarios:**
   - **Mother post-RAI/thyroidectomy:** Still need TRAb monitoring - antibodies persist years after treatment
   - **Blocking antibodies (TBAb):** Can cause fetal/neonatal **hypothyroidism** - check TSH, Free T4
   - **Mixed antibodies:** May see alternating hyper/hypothyroidism - complex management

**2024 Key Evidence:**
- Lowest documented maternal TRAb causing neonatal thyrotoxicosis: **4.4 IU/L (3.7× ULN)**
- Risk proportional to antibody level, but individual variation exists
- Even "low positive" levels warrant increased vigilance

### 5. Pregnancy and Neonatal Risk (2024)
- **Systematic review (2024):** Lowest maternal TRAb causing neonatal thyrotoxicosis: 4.4 IU/L (3.7× ULN)
- **Third-generation TRAb study (2024):** TRAb >3× ULN (>5.4 IU/L) at 24-28 weeks:
  - Sensitivity 87% for neonatal thyroid dysfunction

### 6. Assay Variability and Clinical Implications (2023-2024)
- **Multicenter performance study (2024):** 6 TRAb assays compared:
  - Sensitivity range: 92-97%
  - Specificity range: 96-99.4%
  - **Significant finding:** 6.6% discordant results between Roche TRAb and Siemens TSI
  - 5.0% negative by TRAb but positive by TSI (TSI more sensitive for low-level antibodies)
- **Abbott vs Roche comparison (2023):**
  - High correlation (rs = 0.87) but mean bias 0.71 IU/L
  - Abbott assay more stable (7-day calibration vs daily for Roche)
- **Clinical implication:** Cutoff values NOT directly comparable between assays - use same assay for longitudinal monitoring

### 7. Functional Medicine and Integrative Approaches (2024)
- **Selenium supplementation:** 200 mcg/day reduces TRAb levels by 20-30% in 6-12 months
- **L-carnitine:** 2-4 g/day reduces hyperthyroid symptoms, adjunct to antithyroid drugs
- **Vitamin D optimization:** Levels <30 ng/mL associated with higher TRAb and relapse risk
- **Stress reduction:** Chronic stress (elevated cortisol) exacerbates autoimmune thyroid disease
- **Gut health:** Emerging evidence links intestinal permeability ("leaky gut") to thyroid autoimmunity

**Note:** Most functional medicine recommendations are based on physiologic rationale and smaller studies. Large RCTs are limited. These interventions are considered **adjunctive** to conventional treatment, not replacements.

### 8. Blocking Antibodies and Atypical Presentations (2023-2024)
- **Blocking TRAb (TBAb):** Cause hypothyroidism via thyroid atrophy
  - Distinguished from goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis
  - Require functional bioassay (not standard binding TRAb)
- **Mixed antibody states:** Both stimulating and blocking antibodies can coexist
  - Causes alternating hyper/hypothyroidism ("pendulum" thyroid disease)
  - Switching between TSAb and TBAb documented after treatment initiation
- **Clinical importance:** Consider functional bioassay (TSI/TBI) for atypical presentations

## Special Considerations

### 1. Assay Variability (Critical)

**Different Methods, Different Cutoffs:**
Standard TRAb assays are NOT directly interchangeable. The 1.75 IU/L cutoff applies to:
- Roche Elecsys TRAb (most common reference standard)
- Abbott Alinity i TRAb
- Siemens Advia Centaur (less common)

**Other assays use different cutoffs:**
- Siemens Immulite TSI: 0.55 IU/L
- Thermo Fisher EliA: 3.2 IU/L
- Brahms Kryptor: 0.9 IU/L

**Clinical Implications:**
1. **Always document assay method** when reporting results
2. **Use same assay for serial monitoring** - don't switch platforms mid-treatment
3. If patient switches labs, expect slight variation in absolute values
4. In discordant cases (suspicious for Graves' but TRAb negative on one assay), consider:
   - Repeat with different assay/method
   - Order functional bioassay (TSI)
   - Evaluate clinical context

**Binding Assays vs Functional Bioassays:**
- **Binding assays** (Roche, Abbott, Siemens): Measure total antibodies binding to TSH receptor
  - Pros: Fast, automated, widely available, cheap ($50-100)
  - Cons: Can't distinguish stimulating from blocking antibodies

- **Functional bioassays** (TSI, TBI): Measure actual thyroid-stimulating or blocking activity
  - Pros: Functional information, can distinguish antibody types, may correlate better with disease severity
  - Cons: Expensive ($200-400), longer turnaround, limited availability, less standardized

**2024 Evidence:** In 6.6% of cases, Siemens TSI was positive while Roche TRAb was negative. TSI may be more sensitive for detecting low-level or early disease.

### 2. Context Dependencies

**TRAb Interpretation Depends on Clinical Setting:**

| Clinical Scenario | TRAb Positive | TRAb Negative | Action |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Hyperthyroidism (low TSH, high T4/T3)** | Graves' disease (95%+) | Other cause: toxic nodule, thyroiditis, iodine excess | Thyroid ultrasound/uptake scan |
| **Euthyroid (normal TSH, T4, T3)** | Subclinical Graves' (monitor), or remission (past history), or early disease | Normal or other autoimmune (check TPO/TG) | Monitor TFTs q3-6 months |
| **Hypothyroidism (high TSH, low T4)** | Blocking antibodies (TBAb) - order functional bioassay | Hashimoto's (check TPO/TG), or primary hypothyroidism | Differentiate with bioassay |
| **Pregnancy** | High fetal/neonatal risk | Low risk (if no Graves' history) | See pregnancy section |
| **Post-treatment Graves'** | Active disease or high relapse risk | Remission (if sustained >12 months) | See monitoring section |

**Age Considerations:**
- **Pediatric:** Higher baseline relapse risk (70-80%), may require longer treatment
- **Elderly:** Lower relapse risk after remission, but higher surgical/RAI complications
- **Childbearing age:** Important for pregnancy planning - achieve stable disease before conception

**Smoking:**
- Smokers have higher TRAb levels, worse disease outcomes, more severe ophthalmopathy
- Smoking cessation improves remission rates (evidence-based recommendation)

### 3. Common Confounders

**False Positives (Rare with Third-Generation Assays):**
- Heterophile antibodies (human anti-mouse antibodies - HAMA)
- Biotin supplementation (interferes with some assays - stop 72 hours before test)
- Rheumatoid factor (high RF can interfere)
- Other autoimmune diseases (rare cross-reactivity)

**False Negatives:**
- Very early disease (antibodies not yet detectable)
- Technical issues: hemolyzed sample, improper storage
- Rare cases with antibodies to non-conformational epitopes (assay-dependent)

**Gray Zone Results (1.0-1.75 IU/L):**
- May represent:
  - Assay variability (repeat test)
  - Early disease (monitor, repeat in 3-6 months)
  - Tail end of remission (good sign if trending down)
  - Non-specific low-level antibodies (clinical context key)
- **Management:** Don't base major decisions on borderline values - repeat, check trends, correlate with clinical picture

### 4. Clinical Interpretation Notes

**TRAb is a Marker, Not the Disease:**
- High TRAb = active autoimmune process, but symptoms driven by thyroid hormone levels
- Some patients have very high TRAb but mild clinical disease (depends on T4/T3 levels)
- Conversely, some have moderate TRAb but severe hyperthyroidism
- **Always interpret TRAb with thyroid function tests (TSH, Free T4, Free T3)**

**TRAb Changes Over Time:**
- **During treatment:** Expect TRAb to decrease 25-75% by 6-12 months
  - If not decreasing: consider longer treatment, higher doses, or definitive therapy
- **After treatment:** Slow decline continues for months to years
  - TRAb may remain detectable at low levels (1-3 IU/L) for years even in remission
  - Trend more important than single value

**When TRAb Results Don't Match Clinical Picture:**
1. **Hyperthyroidism + Negative TRAb:**
   - Consider other causes (toxic nodule, thyroiditis, medication-induced)
   - Repeat TRAb with different assay or order TSI bioassay
   - Thyroid ultrasound and/or radioactive iodine uptake scan

2. **Euthyroid + High TRAb:**
   - May represent subclinical disease, remission phase, or neutral antibodies
   - Check for subtle hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH with normal Free T4/T3)
   - Monitor closely - may progress to overt disease

3. **Hypothyroidism + Positive TRAb:**
   - Likely blocking antibodies (TBAb) - order functional bioassay
   - Or concurrent Hashimoto's with Graves' disease (check TPO/TG)
   - Rare: over-treatment of Graves' with antithyroid drugs

**Special Populations:**
- **Children:** Higher relapse rates despite lower TRAb - may reflect immune system immaturity
- **Pregnant women:** TRAb levels may fluctuate due to pregnancy-induced immune modulation (generally improves)
- **Postpartum:** TRAb often rebounds postpartum - highest relapse risk in first 6-12 months after delivery
- **Elderly:** May have lower TRAb levels but still significant disease (higher sensitivity to thyroid hormone)

## Functional Medicine Interventions by Risk Level

### All Levels (Foundation)
1. **Nutrition:**
   - Anti-inflammatory diet (eliminate gluten, dairy, processed foods if sensitive)
   - Cruciferous vegetables (moderate amounts, cooked)
   - Wild-caught fish (omega-3s)
   - Organic, pesticide-free produce

2. **Nutrients:**
   - Selenium: 200 mcg/day (Brazil nuts, supplement)
   - Vitamin D: Optimize to 50-80 ng/mL
   - Zinc: 15-30 mg/day
   - Magnesium: 300-500 mg/day
   - Omega-3 fatty acids: 2-3 g/day (EPA+DHA)

3. **Lifestyle:**
   - Stress management (meditation, yoga, deep breathing)
   - Sleep optimization (7-9 hours, consistent schedule)
   - Avoid endocrine disruptors (BPA, phthalates, parabens)
   - Smoking cessation (critical - worsens all outcomes)

### Levels 3-6 (Active Disease - Additional Interventions)
1. **Herbal Support (Adjunctive):**
   - Bugleweed (Lycopus spp.): Mild antithyroid effects
   - Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis): Blocks TSH receptor
   - Motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca): For palpitations/anxiety
   - **Caution:** Use under practitioner guidance, monitor TFTs

2. **Advanced Nutrients:**
   - L-carnitine: 2-4 g/day (blocks T3 cellular entry)
   - Coenzyme Q10: 100-200 mg/day (antioxidant support)
   - N-acetylcysteine (NAC): 600-1200 mg/day (glutathione precursor)

3. **Root Cause Approaches:**
   - **Gut healing:** Leaky gut associated with autoimmunity
     - Eliminate food sensitivities (test-guided)
     - Probiotic supplementation
     - L-glutamine, zinc carnosine, DGL licorice
   - **Chronic infections:** Screen for EBV, Yersinia, H. pylori
   - **Heavy metal toxicity:** Consider testing, chelation if positive
   - **Chronic stress:** HPA axis support, adaptogenic herbs (ashwagandha, rhodiola)

4. **Immune Modulation (Levels 5-6):**
   - Low-dose naltrexone (LDN): 1.5-4.5 mg at bedtime
     - Modulates immune function, reduces antibodies in some studies
     - Requires prescription, compounded pharmacy
   - Vitamin A: 10,000-25,000 IU/day (immune regulation)
   - Curcumin: 500-1000 mg/day (anti-inflammatory)

### Evidence Quality
- **Strong evidence:** Selenium, vitamin D, stress reduction, smoking cessation
- **Moderate evidence:** L-carnitine, omega-3s, gut health interventions
- **Limited/Emerging evidence:** Herbal therapies, LDN, specific dietary eliminations
- **Always:** Use as adjuncts to conventional treatment, not replacements
- **Monitor:** TRAb, TFTs, and clinical status every 4-12 weeks depending on level

## Key Takeaways for Clinicians

1. **TRAb is THE diagnostic test for Graves' disease** - sensitivity 92-97%, specificity 96-99%

2. **Optimal functional medicine target: <1.0 IU/L (undetectable)**

3. **Risk is LINEAR** - higher TRAb = worse outcomes at every level

4. **Baseline TRAb predicts remission:**
   - <10 IU/L: 63% remission with 12-24 months treatment
   - >20 IU/L: <20% remission even with prolonged treatment

5. **Critical monitoring timepoints:**
   - 6 months: TRAb should decrease >50% from baseline
   - 12 months: TRAb >7.5 IU/L predicts >90% relapse
   - Treatment cessation: TRAb >3.85 IU/L predicts >90% relapse

6. **Pregnancy is high-stakes:**
   - TRAb >3× ULN (>5.4 IU/L) requires intensive fetal monitoring
   - Even euthyroid post-RAI mothers need TRAb testing
   - Neonatal thyrotoxicosis can be delayed - always check at-risk infants

7. **Assays are NOT interchangeable:**
   - 1.75 IU/L cutoff specific to Roche/Abbott
   - Use same assay for serial monitoring
   - Document assay method in records

8. **Functional medicine adds value:**
   - Selenium, vitamin D, stress reduction have evidence
   - Gut health, chronic infections, toxins are plausible targets
   - Always adjunctive to conventional treatment

9. **Prolonged treatment works:**
   - 60+ months antithyroid drugs increases remission to 90% (even high-titer patients)
   - Traditional 12-18 months too short for many patients

10. **When in doubt, trend over time:**
    - Single TRAb less useful than serial measurements
    - Pattern of change more predictive than absolute value
    - Correlate with clinical picture and thyroid function tests
