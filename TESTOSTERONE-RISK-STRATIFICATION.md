## Overview

### Why Testosterone Matters in Functional Medicine

Testosterone is a critical biomarker for:
- **Metabolic health**: Insulin sensitivity, body composition, energy metabolism
- **Cardiovascular health**: Mortality risk, atherosclerosis prevention
- **Musculoskeletal health**: Bone density, muscle mass, physical function
- **Cognitive function**: Memory, executive function, mood regulation
- **Reproductive health**: Fertility, sexual function, libido
- **Longevity**: All-cause mortality predictor

### Sex-Specific Importance

**In Men:**
- Primary sex hormone determining masculinization and reproductive function
- Declines ~1-2% annually after age 30
- Low levels associated with 2x mortality risk
- Optimal levels critical for cardiovascular and metabolic health

**In Women:**
- Produced in ovaries and adrenal glands (smaller amounts than men)
- Essential for ovarian function, libido, bone health, muscle mass
- Low levels linked to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular mortality
- Excess levels (hyperandrogenism) seen in PCOS

## Test 1: Total Testosterone

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (in men) / LINEAR-LOW (in women)**

**Rationale:**

**MEN - U-SHAPED CURVE:**
- **Low testosterone** (<300 ng/dL): Associated with 2.07x increased risk of premature death, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cognitive decline, and reduced bone density
- **Optimal range** (600-900 ng/dL): Best outcomes for cardiometabolic health, body composition, cognitive function, and longevity
- **High physiologic levels** (>1000 ng/dL): Natural levels at upper range generally safe; however, supraphysiologic levels from misuse/abuse show increased cardiovascular risk
- Evidence shows both extremes carry risk, with optimal health in mid-to-upper physiologic range

**WOMEN - LINEAR-LOW:**
- Low testosterone consistently associated with adverse outcomes (metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular mortality, reduced bone density)
- Optimal levels support ovarian function, bone health, and metabolic health
- High levels indicate pathology (PCOS, hyperandrogenism) rather than optimization

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit (US):** ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter)

**Alternative Units:**
- **nmol/L** (SI unit, used in Europe, UK, Canada)
  - **Conversion:** ng/dL × 0.0347 = nmol/L
  - **Conversion:** nmol/L × 28.84 = ng/dL
- **ng/mL** (nanograms per milliliter)
  - **Conversion:** ng/dL ÷ 100 = ng/mL

**Example Conversions:**
- 500 ng/dL = 17.35 nmol/L = 5 ng/mL
- 15 nmol/L = 432.6 ng/dL = 4.326 ng/mL
- 700 ng/dL = 24.29 nmol/L = 7 ng/mL

### Risk Stratification Levels: MEN

| Risk Level | Range (ng/dL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <200 | <6.94 | Severe hypogonadism; significantly increased mortality risk; severe symptoms (fatigue, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, depression); bone loss; muscle wasting; metabolic syndrome | <196 ng/dL (men 60+): Increased mortality |
| **LOW** | 200-299 | 6.94-10.37 | Clinically significant testosterone deficiency; increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (OR 2.07); symptomatic hypogonadism; reduced bone density; decreased lean mass; eligible for TRT | <300 ng/dL: AUA treatment threshold |
| **SUBOPTIMAL** | 300-549 | 10.37-19.05 | Below optimal but within "normal" lab range; may have subtle symptoms; suboptimal metabolic and cardiovascular health; opportunity for lifestyle optimization | <7.4 nmol/L (210 ng/dL): Higher mortality risk marker |
| **OPTIMAL** | 550-900 | 19.05-31.24 | **Functional medicine target range**; best outcomes for cardiometabolic health, body composition, cognitive function, bone density, and longevity; minimal symptoms | 600-900 ng/dL: Superpower optimal range |
| **HIGH PHYSIOLOGIC** | 900-1200 | 31.24-41.62 | Upper end of natural physiologic range; generally safe if endogenous; common in young healthy men; monitor if on TRT | >1000 ng/dL: Upper limit of typical lab range |
| **SUPRAPHYSIOLOGIC** | >1200 | >41.62 | Above natural range; typically indicates exogenous testosterone use; increased cardiovascular risk with improper dosing/monitoring; requires medical supervision | >1500 ng/dL: Likely exogenous source |

#### Age-Specific Considerations for Men

**20-30 years:**
- Typical range: 400-1080 ng/dL
- Peak testosterone years
- Optimal: 700-900 ng/dL

**30-40 years:**
- Typical range: 350-890 ng/dL
- Beginning of 1% annual decline
- Optimal: 600-850 ng/dL

**40-50 years:**
- Typical range: 251-914 ng/dL (95th percentile)
- Low threshold: <251 ng/dL
- Optimal: 550-800 ng/dL

**50-60 years:**
- Typical range: 216-876 ng/dL (95th percentile)
- Low threshold: <216 ng/dL
- Optimal: 500-750 ng/dL

**60+ years:**
- Typical range: 196-859 ng/dL (95th percentile)
- Low threshold: <196 ng/dL
- Optimal: 450-700 ng/dL
- **Most significant mortality benefit from maintaining optimal levels**

### Risk Stratification Levels: WOMEN

| Risk Level | Range (ng/dL) | Range (nmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <5 | <0.17 | Severe testosterone deficiency; significant impact on bone density, muscle mass, libido, energy; increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk | Lowest quartile: Highest MACE risk |
| **LOW** | 5-9 | 0.17-0.31 | Below optimal; may experience reduced libido, fatigue, decreased muscle mass, bone density concerns; increased cardiovascular mortality risk | <10 ng/dL: Associated with metabolic syndrome |
| **SUBOPTIMAL** | 10-24 | 0.35-0.83 | Lower end of conventional range; suboptimal for metabolic health, bone density, and lean mass; opportunity for optimization | Premenopausal lower bound |
| **OPTIMAL** | 25-50 | 0.87-1.73 | **Functional medicine target range**; supports metabolic health, bone density, libido, muscle mass, and ovarian function; best outcomes | Premenopausal mid-range target |
| **HIGH NORMAL** | 50-70 | 1.73-2.43 | Upper end of physiologic range; generally healthy if no signs of hyperandrogenism; monitor for PCOS symptoms | Approaching hyperandrogenism threshold |
| **ELEVATED/HYPERANDROGENISM** | >70 | >2.43 | Indicates hyperandrogenism (PCOS, CAH, adrenal/ovarian tumor); associated with metabolic risk, irregular cycles, hirsutism, acne | >77 ng/dL (>2.67 nmol/L): PCOS diagnostic threshold |

#### Menstrual Cycle Phase Considerations

**Follicular Phase (Days 1-14):**
- Early follicular: Lowest testosterone levels
- Mid-follicular: Gradual increase
- Target sampling: Day 3-5 for baseline assessment

**Ovulation (Day 14):**
- **Peak testosterone** (can increase 30-50% above baseline)
- Timing: Mid-cycle surge (e.g., 15.6 ng/dL → 43.6 ng/dL at peak)
- Avoid testing during ovulation for baseline assessment

**Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):**
- Early luteal: Elevated compared to early follicular
- Late luteal: Decline below mid-follicular levels
- More stable than ovulation period

**Clinical Recommendation:** Test on **Day 3-5 of menstrual cycle** for most consistent baseline assessment, avoiding mid-cycle surge.

#### Menopause Considerations

**Postmenopausal Women:**
- Typical range: 7-40 ng/dL (0.24-1.39 nmol/L)
- Optimal range: 15-35 ng/dL (0.52-1.21 nmol/L)
- Lower levels than premenopausal due to ovarian decline
- Adrenal production becomes primary source
- **Some functional medicine protocols restore to 90-200 ng/dL** with HRT for symptom management

### Optimal Ranges: Functional Medicine 2023-2026

#### Men - Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges

**Source: Superpower, Optimal Bio, OptimalDX (2024-2025)**

| Organization | Total Testosterone Optimal Range | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| **Superpower** | 600-900 ng/dL (20.8-31.2 nmol/L) | Better aligned with early deficiency diagnosis; best outcomes in cardiometabolic health, body composition, longevity |
| **OptimalDX** | 650-850 ng/dL (22.5-29.5 nmol/L) | Functional optimal range for adult men |
| **Conventional Labs** | 300-1000 ng/dL (10.4-34.7 nmol/L) | Too broad; designed to catch severe deficiency only; not optimized for health |
| **AUA Treatment Threshold** | <300 ng/dL (<10.4 nmol/L) | Clinical treatment cutoff for hypogonadism |

**Key Point:** Functional medicine targets the **upper-middle physiologic range** (600-900 ng/dL) rather than simply "normal" (300-1000 ng/dL), recognizing that many men experience symptoms and health consequences even at 350-500 ng/dL despite being "in range."

#### Women - Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges

**Source: OptimalDX, Rupa Health, Optimal Bio (2023-2025)**

| Life Stage | Conventional Range | Functional Medicine Optimal |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Premenopausal** | 10-55 ng/dL (0.35-1.91 nmol/L) | 25-50 ng/dL (0.87-1.73 nmol/L) |
| **Postmenopausal** | 7-40 ng/dL (0.24-1.39 nmol/L) | 15-35 ng/dL (0.52-1.21 nmol/L) |
| **Optimal Bio HRT Target** | N/A | 90-200 ng/dL (3.1-6.9 nmol/L) for symptomatic women |

**Note:** HRT targets from Optimal Bio represent therapeutic restoration for women with severe deficiency symptoms, not physiologic optimal ranges.

### Special Considerations

#### 1. Context Dependencies

**Men:**
- **Age:** Most critical factor; decline begins age 30, accelerates after 60
- **Time of day:** Testosterone peaks in morning (8-10 AM); lowest in evening
- **Recommended sampling:** 7-11 AM for consistency
- **Obesity:** Increased aromatization to estrogen; lower total testosterone
- **Chronic illness:** CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome lower testosterone
- **Medications:** Opioids, corticosteroids, statins may suppress testosterone
- **Sleep:** Poor sleep quality/quantity reduces testosterone production

**Women:**
- **Menstrual cycle phase:** Test on Day 3-5 for baseline; avoid mid-cycle
- **Menopause:** Expected 30-50% decline from premenopausal levels
- **Oral contraceptives:** Increase SHBG, may lower free testosterone
- **PCOS:** Elevated testosterone (>70 ng/dL) with clinical hyperandrogenism

#### 2. Relationship with SHBG (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin)

**Critical Interaction:**
- Only **2-3% of testosterone is FREE (unbound)** and biologically active
- ~44-65% is bound to SHBG (high affinity, biologically inactive)
- ~33-54% is bound to albumin (low affinity, bioavailable)

**SHBG Impact on Total Testosterone Interpretation:**

| SHBG Status | Total Testosterone | Free Testosterone | Clinical Implication |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Low SHBG** | Normal | High | More bioavailable testosterone; common in metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance |
| **Normal SHBG** | Normal | Normal | Appropriate bioavailable testosterone |
| **High SHBG** | Normal or High | Low | Less bioavailable testosterone; symptoms possible despite normal total T; common with aging, hyperthyroidism, liver disease |

**Key Point:** **ALWAYS assess free testosterone or calculate bioavailable testosterone when total testosterone is borderline or symptoms don't match total testosterone levels.**

**Causes of High SHBG** (leading to falsely reassuring total T):
- Aging
- Hyperthyroidism
- Liver cirrhosis
- Oral estrogen therapy
- Anticonvulsants

**Causes of Low SHBG** (leading to falsely concerning total T):
- Obesity
- Metabolic syndrome
- Insulin resistance
- Hypothyroidism
- High-dose androgens

#### 3. Common Confounders

**Laboratory Issues:**
- **Assay variability:** Different labs use different methods (immunoassay vs LC-MS/MS)
- **Immunoassay limitations:** May cross-react, less accurate at low levels
- **Gold standard:** LC-MS/MS for total testosterone, especially for women and children
- **Diurnal variation:** Can vary 20-25% throughout the day

**Physiological Confounders:**
- **Acute illness:** Temporary suppression
- **Exercise:** Intense exercise can transiently increase or decrease testosterone depending on intensity/duration
- **Stress:** Elevated cortisol suppresses testosterone (HPA-axis dysfunction)
- **Alcohol:** Chronic use suppresses testosterone production
- **Diet:** Very low-fat diets, caloric restriction lower testosterone

**Medications:**
- Opioids (chronic use)
- Corticosteroids
- Antipsychotics
- Ketoconazole
- Spironolactone
- Metformin (in women, may improve PCOS-related hyperandrogenism)

#### 4. When Total Testosterone is Insufficient

**Clinical Scenarios Requiring Free or Bioavailable Testosterone:**
1. Borderline total testosterone (300-400 ng/dL in men)
2. Symptoms of testosterone deficiency despite normal total testosterone
3. Known SHBG abnormalities
4. Obesity or metabolic syndrome
5. Aging men (SHBG increases with age)
6. Women (total testosterone often too low to accurately measure)
7. Evaluating response to testosterone therapy

## Test 2: Free Testosterone

### Risk Curve Type: **U-SHAPED (in men) / LINEAR-LOW (in women)**

**Rationale:**

**MEN - U-SHAPED CURVE:**
- **Low free testosterone**: Directly correlates with symptoms of hypogonadism even when total testosterone appears normal (due to high SHBG); increased metabolic risk
- **Optimal range**: Best symptom control, metabolic health, sexual function, body composition
- **High free testosterone**: Natural high levels generally safe, but supraphysiologic levels from exogenous testosterone associated with cardiovascular risk and other side effects

**WOMEN - LINEAR-LOW:**
- Low free testosterone associated with reduced libido, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, increased metabolic risk
- Optimal levels support metabolic health, sexual function, bone density
- High levels indicate hyperandrogenism (PCOS)

---

### Primary Unit & Conversions

**Primary Unit (US):** pg/mL (picograms per milliliter)

**Alternative Units:**
- **ng/dL** (nanograms per deciliter)
  - **Conversion:** pg/mL ÷ 10 = ng/dL
  - **Conversion:** ng/dL × 10 = pg/mL
- **pmol/L** (picomoles per liter, SI unit)
  - **Conversion:** pg/mL × 3.467 = pmol/L
  - **Conversion:** pmol/L ÷ 3.467 = pg/mL

**Example Conversions:**
- 100 pg/mL = 10 ng/dL = 346.7 pmol/L
- 20 pg/mL = 2 ng/dL = 69.3 pmol/L
- 5 pg/mL = 0.5 ng/dL = 17.3 pmol/L

### Risk Stratification Levels: MEN

| Risk Level | Range (pg/mL) | Range (pmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <3 | <10.4 | Severe free testosterone deficiency; symptoms guaranteed (severe fatigue, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, depression); metabolic syndrome; muscle wasting | <3 pg/mL: Severe hypogonadism |
| **LOW** | 3-7.9 | 10.4-27.4 | Clinically significant deficiency; symptomatic hypogonadism likely; increased metabolic risk; consider treatment | <5 pg/mL: Commonly symptomatic |
| **SUBOPTIMAL** | 8-14.9 | 27.7-51.7 | Below optimal; may have subtle symptoms despite "normal" total testosterone; opportunity for optimization | <10 pg/mL: Many functional medicine practitioners intervene |
| **OPTIMAL** | 15-25 | 52-86.7 | **Functional medicine target range**; best outcomes for sexual function, body composition, energy, mood, metabolic health | Superpower optimal: 15-25 pg/mL |
| **HIGH PHYSIOLOGIC** | 25-35 | 86.7-121.3 | Upper end of physiologic range; generally safe if endogenous; monitor symptoms | Typical lab upper limit: ~30 pg/mL |
| **SUPRAPHYSIOLOGIC** | >35 | >121.3 | Above typical physiologic range; likely exogenous testosterone; increased side effect risk; requires medical supervision | >40 pg/mL: Investigate exogenous source |

#### Age-Specific Reference Ranges for Men

**20-29 years:**
- Typical range: 9.3-26.5 pg/mL (47-130 pmol/L)
- Optimal: 18-25 pg/mL

**30-39 years:**
- Typical range: 8.7-25.1 pg/mL (46-117 pmol/L)
- Optimal: 17-24 pg/mL

**40-49 years:**
- Typical range: 6.8-21.5 pg/mL (40-103 pmol/L)
- Optimal: 15-22 pg/mL

**50-59 years:**
- Typical range: 7.2-24.0 pg/mL (42-110 pmol/L)
- Optimal: 14-21 pg/mL

**60-69 years:**
- Typical range: 6.6-18.1 pg/mL (40-88 pmol/L)
- Optimal: 13-20 pg/mL

**70+ years:**
- Typical range: 6.4-15.6 pg/mL (33-75 pmol/L)
- Optimal: 12-18 pg/mL

### Risk Stratification Levels: WOMEN

| Risk Level | Range (pg/mL) | Range (pmol/L) | Clinical Significance | Key Thresholds |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL LOW** | <0.5 | <1.7 | Severe testosterone deficiency; significant loss of libido, severe fatigue, muscle wasting, bone loss risk | Undetectable levels |
| **LOW** | 0.5-1.2 | 1.7-4.2 | Below optimal; reduced libido, low energy, decreased muscle mass, increased metabolic risk | <1.0 pg/mL: Commonly symptomatic |
| **SUBOPTIMAL** | 1.3-3.2 | 4.5-11.1 | Lower end of conventional range; suboptimal for metabolic health, sexual function; opportunity for optimization | Conventional lower bound |
| **OPTIMAL** | 3.25-4.6 | 11.3-15.9 | **Functional medicine target range (OptimalDX)**; supports metabolic health, libido, muscle mass, bone density | ODX functional range: 3.25-4.6 pg/mL |
| **HIGH NORMAL** | 4.7-6.4 | 16.3-22.2 | Upper end of premenopausal physiologic range (30-year-old woman: 5th-95th percentile 1.2-6.4 pg/mL); monitor for PCOS symptoms | 95th percentile premenopausal |
| **ELEVATED/HYPERANDROGENISM** | >6.5 | >22.5 | Indicates hyperandrogenism (PCOS most common); metabolic risk; irregular cycles, hirsutism, acne; evaluate for ovarian/adrenal pathology | >11 pmol/L (>3.2 pg/mL): PCOS diagnostic threshold per some criteria |

**Note:** Different sources report slightly different upper limits for hyperandrogenism diagnosis; clinical correlation essential.

#### Menstrual Cycle Phase Considerations

**Follicular Phase (Days 1-14):**
- Baseline free testosterone: 1.3-5.6 pg/mL (calculated)
- Test on Day 3-5 for consistent baseline

**Ovulation (Day 14):**
- Peak: Can increase significantly above baseline
- Avoid testing at mid-cycle for baseline assessment

**Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):**
- Slightly elevated compared to early follicular
- More stable than ovulation

**Postmenopausal:**
- Lower than premenopausal due to ovarian decline
- Expected range: Lower end of premenopausal range
- Adrenal production becomes primary source

### Optimal Ranges: Functional Medicine 2023-2026

#### Men - Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges

**Source: Superpower, OptimalDX (2024-2025)**

| Organization | Free Testosterone Optimal Range | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| **Superpower** | 15-25 pg/mL (52-86.7 pmol/L) | Best aligned with symptom control, metabolic health, body composition |
| **OptimalDX** | 16-23 pg/mL (55-80 pmol/L) | Functional optimal range for adult men |
| **Conventional Labs** | 5.0-21.0 pg/mL (17.3-72.8 pmol/L) or similar | Too broad; lower bound too low for optimal function |
| **Most Experts** | 50-210 pg/mL (cited in some sources, likely error or different assay) | Likely refers to different assay or unit confusion |

**Key Point:** Functional medicine targets **15-25 pg/mL** for men, recognizing that levels below 10 pg/mL often cause symptoms even if technically "in range."

#### Women - Functional Medicine Optimal Ranges

**Source: OptimalDX, Rupa Health (2023-2025)**

| **Calculated Free T (30 years)** | 1.3-5.6 pg/mL (Vermeulen calculation) | 3.0-5.0 pg/mL |
| **Postmenopausal** | Lower end of premenopausal range | 2.5-4.0 pg/mL (estimated) |

**PCOS Diagnosis:**
- Free testosterone >5.7 pg/mL (vs 2.5 pg/mL in controls) in some studies
- Normal upper limit: 3.6 pg/mL per some references
- Free testosterone index (FTI) >5.5 suggests hyperandrogenism

### Special Considerations

#### 1. Free Testosterone vs Total Testosterone: When to Use Each

**Use Total Testosterone:**
- Initial screening in men
- Monitoring testosterone therapy response (along with free T)
- Clear-cut cases (very low or very high)

**Use Free Testosterone (or Calculate Bioavailable):**
- **ESSENTIAL SCENARIOS:**
  1. Borderline total testosterone with symptoms
  2. Suspected SHBG abnormalities (obesity, metabolic syndrome, aging, liver disease, hyperthyroidism)
  3. Women (total T often insufficient due to low levels)
  4. Evaluating PCOS and hyperandrogenism
  5. Men with symptoms despite "normal" total T
  6. Monitoring TRT effectiveness for symptom resolution

**Best Practice:** Order **total testosterone + SHBG + albumin** together, then calculate free and bioavailable testosterone using Vermeulen equation.

#### 2. Percent Free Testosterone

**Definition:** (Free Testosterone ÷ Total Testosterone) × 100

**Normal Ranges:**
- Men: ~2-3% of total testosterone is free
- Women: Similar percentage

**Clinical Use:**
- Helps assess SHBG impact
- Low percentage: High SHBG (less bioavailable testosterone)
- High percentage: Low SHBG (more bioavailable testosterone, common in metabolic syndrome)

**Source:** [OptimalDX - Percent Free Testosterone](https://www.optimaldx.com/research-blog/hormone-biomarkers-percent-free-testosterone)

#### 3. Relationship with SHBG (Critical)

**SHBG Impact on Free Testosterone:**

| SHBG Level | Total T | Free T | % Free T | Clinical Scenario |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Low SHBG** | Normal/Low | High | High (>3%) | Metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance; more bioavailable T |
| **Normal SHBG** | Normal | Normal | Normal (~2-3%) | Healthy balance |
| **High SHBG** | Normal/High | Low | Low (<2%) | Aging, hyperthyroidism, liver disease; less bioavailable T; symptoms possible despite normal/high total T |

**Key Insight:** A man with total testosterone of 500 ng/dL may be:
- **Functionally low** (high SHBG → free T only 8 pg/mL → symptomatic)
- **Functionally normal** (normal SHBG → free T 18 pg/mL → asymptomatic)
- **Functionally high** (low SHBG → free T 28 pg/mL → asymptomatic, metabolic syndrome present)

**This is why free testosterone or calculated bioavailable testosterone is ESSENTIAL for accurate assessment.**

#### 4. Common Confounders for Free Testosterone

**All confounders affecting total testosterone also affect free testosterone:**
- Time of day (diurnal variation)
- Acute illness
- Medications (opioids, corticosteroids)
- Obesity
- Stress
- Sleep deprivation
- Alcohol

**Additional confounders specific to free testosterone measurement:**
- **SHBG level** (most important)
- **Albumin level** (less impact than SHBG but still relevant)
- **Assay method** (direct immunoassay unreliable; use calculation or equilibrium dialysis)
- **Temperature during equilibrium dialysis** (affects binding equilibrium)

#### 5. Clinical Interpretation Pearls

**Men:**
- Free testosterone <10 pg/mL: Highly likely symptomatic, consider intervention
- Free testosterone 10-15 pg/mL: Suboptimal, evaluate symptoms and optimize lifestyle
- Free testosterone 15-25 pg/mL: Optimal target for functional medicine
- Free testosterone >30 pg/mL: Investigate exogenous source if not naturally high in young man

**Women:**
- Free testosterone <1 pg/mL: Likely symptomatic (low libido, fatigue, muscle loss)
- Free testosterone 1-3 pg/mL: Suboptimal, consider optimization
- Free testosterone 3-5 pg/mL: Optimal target (ODX: 3.25-4.6 pg/mL)
- Free testosterone >6 pg/mL: Investigate hyperandrogenism (PCOS, adrenal/ovarian pathology)

**PCOS Diagnosis:**
- Requires clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne) AND/OR elevated androgens
- Free testosterone more sensitive than total testosterone
- Free androgen index (FAI) = (Total T / SHBG) × 100; >5.5 suggests hyperandrogenism
- Correlation with metabolic risk stronger than isolated androstenedione elevation

## Calculation Methods & Laboratory Considerations

### 1. Testosterone Measurement Methods

#### Total Testosterone Measurement

**Gold Standard: LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry)**
- **Accuracy:** Excellent across all ranges
- **Precision:** High
- **Range:** Can accurately measure low levels (important for women, children)
- **CDC Standardization:** Available for LC-MS/MS methods
- **Cost:** Higher than immunoassay
- **Recommendation:** Preferred method, especially for:
  - Women (low levels)
  - Children
  - Monitoring testosterone therapy
  - Research settings

**Alternative: Immunoassay**
- **Accuracy:** Acceptable for men with normal-high levels; less accurate at low levels
- **Limitations:** Cross-reactivity with other steroids; overestimates at low levels
- **Cost:** Lower than LC-MS/MS
- **Use:** Acceptable for screening in adult men; not recommended for women or children

**Clinical Recommendation:** Request LC-MS/MS method for most accurate results, especially for women, borderline cases, and monitoring therapy.

---

### 2. Free Testosterone Measurement/Calculation Methods

#### Method 1: Calculated Free Testosterone (Vermeulen Equation) - RECOMMENDED

**Requirements:**
- Total testosterone (by LC-MS/MS or immunoassay)
- SHBG level
- Albumin level (or assume 4.3 g/dL)

**Formula:**
```
FT = (TT − N − SHBG + √((N + SHBG − TT)² + 4NT)) / 2N

Where:
- FT = Free Testosterone
- TT = Total Testosterone
- SHBG = Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin
- N = 0.5217 × albumin concentration + 1
- Albumin typically ~4.3 g/dL (43 g/L)
```

**Advantages:**
- Nearly identical to equilibrium dialysis (r = 0.986)
- Rapid, no additional sample needed
- Can be automated in lab systems
- Cost-effective

**Limitations:**
- Assumes normal albumin (adjust if abnormal)
- Less accurate during pregnancy
- Requires accurate total T and SHBG measurements

**Performance (2025 Method):**
- Linearity: 1.74-890 pmol/L (0.5-256 pg/mL)
- LLOQ: 1.74 pmol/L (sufficient for women)
- Intra-assay CV: <3.8%
- Inter-assay CV: <5.9%
- Recovery: 92.9%-108.2%

**When to Use:**
- Research settings
- Disputed cases
- Validation of calculated methods
- When extreme accuracy needed

#### Method 3: Direct Immunoassay for Free Testosterone - NOT RECOMMENDED

**Procedure:**
- Direct measurement by immunoassay (analog method)

**Problems:**
- Poor correlation with equilibrium dialysis
- Overestimates or underestimates free testosterone
- Significant inter-assay variability
- Not standardized

**Recommendation:** **AVOID.** Use calculated free testosterone or equilibrium dialysis instead.

### 3. Bioavailable Testosterone Calculation

**Definition:** Free testosterone + albumin-bound testosterone (both biologically active)

**Formula:**
```
Bioavailable T (nmol/L) = Free T (nmol/L) × (1 + c)

Where:
- c = 22.43 (assuming albumin = 43 g/L / 4.3 g/dL)
- Adjust c if albumin abnormal
```

**Alternative Method:** Ammonium sulfate precipitation (direct measurement, rarely used clinically)

**Clinical Use:**
- Provides total biologically active testosterone
- Useful when albumin binding capacity is concern
- Less commonly ordered than free testosterone

### 4. Laboratory Ordering Recommendations

**Optimal Panel for Testosterone Assessment:**

**Men - Initial Evaluation:**
1. **Total Testosterone** (by LC-MS/MS if available)
2. **SHBG**
3. **Albumin** (often part of CMP)
4. Calculate free and bioavailable testosterone using Vermeulen equation
5. **Optional:** LH, FSH (if hypogonadism suspected to determine primary vs secondary)
6. **Optional:** Estradiol (if concerned about aromatization)

**Men - Monitoring Testosterone Therapy:**
1. **Total Testosterone** (target range depends on indication, typically 500-1000 ng/dL)
2. **SHBG**
3. **Calculated Free Testosterone** (target 15-25 pg/mL for symptom control)
4. **Estradiol** (ensure not excessively high due to aromatization)
5. **Hematocrit** (monitor for polycythemia)
6. **PSA** (in older men, monitor prostate health)

**Women - Initial Evaluation:**
1. **Total Testosterone** (by **LC-MS/MS ESSENTIAL** due to low levels)
2. **SHBG**
3. **Albumin**
4. Calculate free testosterone
5. **Timing:** Day 3-5 of menstrual cycle (if premenopausal and cycling)
6. **Optional:** Free androgen index (FAI) = (Total T / SHBG) × 100
7. **If PCOS suspected:** Add DHEA-S, androstenedione, 17-OH progesterone

**Women - Monitoring Testosterone Therapy (if prescribed):**
1. **Total Testosterone** (by LC-MS/MS)
2. **Calculated Free Testosterone**
3. **SHBG**
4. **Symptom assessment** (libido, energy, mood)

---

### 5. Interpretation Workflow

**Step 1: Evaluate Total Testosterone**
- Compare to age- and sex-specific reference ranges
- Consider functional medicine optimal ranges (not just "normal")
- Men: Target 600-900 ng/dL
- Women (premenopausal): Target 25-50 ng/dL

**Step 2: Evaluate SHBG**
- High SHBG: Less free testosterone available (may have symptoms despite normal total T)
- Low SHBG: More free testosterone available (evaluate for metabolic syndrome)
- Normal SHBG: Total T likely reflects bioavailable testosterone

**Step 3: Calculate Free Testosterone**
- Use Vermeulen equation with total T, SHBG, albumin
- Men: Target 15-25 pg/mL
- Women (premenopausal): Target 3.25-4.6 pg/mL

**Step 4: Calculate Percent Free Testosterone**
- Normal: ~2-3%
- Low %: High SHBG (consider causes: aging, hyperthyroidism, liver disease)
- High %: Low SHBG (consider metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance)

**Step 5: Clinical Correlation**
- Do symptoms match lab findings?
- If symptoms present despite "normal" total T, is free T low?
- Evaluate context: age, time of day, medications, comorbidities
- Consider other hormones: LH, FSH (pituitary function), estradiol, DHEA-S

**Step 6: Determine Action Plan**
- Optimize lifestyle (sleep, exercise, stress management, nutrition)
- Treat underlying conditions (obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome)
- Consider testosterone therapy if:
  - Men: Total T <300 ng/dL OR symptomatic with total T 300-400 ng/dL AND low free T
  - Women: Low testosterone with symptoms (libido, fatigue) AND no contraindications
- Recheck in 3-6 months after interventions

---

### 6. Common Laboratory Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Using Direct Immunoassay for Free Testosterone**
- **Problem:** Inaccurate, poor correlation with gold standard
- **Solution:** Always calculate free T from total T + SHBG + albumin

**Pitfall 2: Not Measuring SHBG**
- **Problem:** Cannot interpret total testosterone in context without SHBG
- **Solution:** Always order SHBG with total testosterone

**Pitfall 3: Using Immunoassay for Low Testosterone Levels (Women, Children)**
- **Problem:** Immunoassays overestimate at low levels
- **Solution:** Request LC-MS/MS method for women and children

**Pitfall 4: Ignoring Time of Day**
- **Problem:** Testosterone varies 20-25% throughout day (peak morning)
- **Solution:** Always sample between 7-11 AM for consistency

**Pitfall 5: Testing Women at Wrong Menstrual Cycle Phase**
- **Problem:** Mid-cycle surge can falsely elevate results
- **Solution:** Test on Day 3-5 of cycle (early follicular phase)

**Pitfall 6: Not Accounting for Medications**
- **Problem:** Opioids, corticosteroids, oral contraceptives alter testosterone and SHBG
- **Solution:** Review medications before interpreting results

**Pitfall 7: Single Abnormal Result Leading to Treatment**
- **Problem:** Lab variability, acute illness, stress can cause temporary changes
- **Solution:** Confirm abnormal result with repeat testing before initiating therapy

---

## Clinical Integration & Interpretation

### 1. Integrating Total and Free Testosterone

**Scenario 1: Normal Total T, Low Free T**
- **Labs:** Total T 500 ng/dL (normal), Free T 8 pg/mL (low), SHBG high
- **Interpretation:** High SHBG binding testosterone; less bioavailable testosterone
- **Clinical:** Patient likely symptomatic despite "normal" total T
- **Action:** Treat as testosterone deficiency; optimize lifestyle; consider TRT if symptomatic

**Scenario 2: Normal Total T, High Free T**
- **Labs:** Total T 450 ng/dL (normal-low), Free T 22 pg/mL (optimal), SHBG low
- **Interpretation:** Low SHBG; more testosterone bioavailable; often seen in metabolic syndrome
- **Clinical:** Patient may be asymptomatic for hypogonadism but has metabolic concerns
- **Action:** Address metabolic syndrome (weight loss, insulin resistance); may not need TRT

**Scenario 3: Low Total T, Low Free T**
- **Labs:** Total T 250 ng/dL (low), Free T 5 pg/mL (low), SHBG normal
- **Interpretation:** True testosterone deficiency
- **Clinical:** Symptomatic hypogonadism expected
- **Action:** Lifestyle optimization + likely TRT candidate

**Scenario 4: High Total T, Normal Free T**
- **Labs:** Total T 1100 ng/dL (high), Free T 20 pg/mL (normal), SHBG high
- **Interpretation:** High SHBG binding excess testosterone; bioavailable T still normal
- **Clinical:** Patient likely asymptomatic
- **Action:** Monitor; investigate cause of high SHBG (hyperthyroidism, liver disease)

---

### 2. Testosterone in Context of Other Hormones

**Evaluate Alongside:**

**LH and FSH (Luteinizing Hormone, Follicle-Stimulating Hormone):**
- **Low T + High LH/FSH:** Primary hypogonadism (testicular/ovarian failure)
- **Low T + Low/Normal LH/FSH:** Secondary hypogonadism (pituitary/hypothalamic dysfunction)
- **High T + Suppressed LH/FSH:** Exogenous testosterone use

**Estradiol:**
- **Men on TRT:** Monitor for excessive aromatization (testosterone → estradiol)
- **High estradiol:** Can cause gynecomastia, water retention, mood changes
- **Optimal estradiol in men:** 20-30 pg/mL

**DHEA-S (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate):**
- **Adrenal androgen precursor**
- **Low DHEA-S + Low T:** Adrenal insufficiency, HPA axis dysfunction
- **High DHEA-S (women):** Adrenal source of hyperandrogenism

**Cortisol:**
- **High cortisol:** Suppresses testosterone via HPA axis
- **Chronic stress:** Lowers testosterone production
- **Evaluate:** Morning cortisol, DHEA/cortisol ratio

**Prolactin:**
- **High prolactin:** Suppresses GnRH → low LH → low testosterone
- **Screen if:** Secondary hypogonadism, symptoms of pituitary tumor

**Thyroid (TSH, Free T4, Free T3):**
- **Hyperthyroidism:** Increases SHBG → lowers free testosterone despite normal/high total T
- **Hypothyroidism:** Decreases SHBG → increases free testosterone percentage; may also directly lower T production

---

### 3. Lifestyle and Root-Cause Optimization (Functional Medicine Approach)

**Before Considering TRT, Optimize:**

#### Sleep
- **Target:** 7-9 hours/night
- **Impact:** Sleep deprivation reduces testosterone by 10-15%
- **Action:** Address sleep apnea, improve sleep hygiene

#### Exercise
- **Resistance training:** Increases testosterone acutely and chronically
- **Avoid:** Excessive endurance training (can lower testosterone)
- **Optimal:** 3-5x/week resistance training + moderate cardio

#### Stress Management
- **High cortisol:** Suppresses testosterone via HPA axis
- **Action:** Meditation, yoga, breath work, adequate rest

#### Nutrition
- **Adequate calories:** Chronic caloric restriction lowers testosterone
- **Adequate fat:** Testosterone synthesized from cholesterol; need ~30% calories from healthy fats
- **Micronutrients:** Zinc, magnesium, vitamin D critical for testosterone production
- **Avoid:** Excessive alcohol (suppresses testosterone)

#### Body Composition
- **Obesity:** Increases aromatization (testosterone → estradiol); adipose tissue converts T to E2
- **Target:** Healthy body fat percentage (men: 10-20%, women: 18-28%)
- **Action:** Weight loss can significantly increase testosterone in obese men

#### Toxin Avoidance
- **Endocrine disruptors:** BPA, phthalates, pesticides
- **Action:** Filter water, choose organic when possible, avoid plastics

#### Supplements (Evidence-Based)
- **Vitamin D:** Optimize to 50-80 ng/mL (testosterone is steroid hormone derived from cholesterol, vitamin D receptor involved)
- **Zinc:** 15-30 mg/day (cofactor for testosterone synthesis)
- **Magnesium:** 400-500 mg/day (increases free testosterone)
- **Ashwagandha:** 600 mg/day (reduces cortisol, may increase testosterone)
- **D-Aspartic Acid:** Mixed evidence; may help in deficient men
- **Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia):** Some evidence for increasing testosterone

**Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM) Approach:**
- Identify and treat root causes: HPA axis dysfunction, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, gut dysbiosis, nutrient deficiencies
- Lifestyle interventions first-line
- Consider HRT only after optimization attempts

**American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) Approach:**
- Comprehensive hormone evaluation
- Nutraceuticals and lifestyle interventions
- Bioidentical hormone replacement when appropriate
- Focus on longevity and optimal health, not just symptom management

---

### 4. When to Consider Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

**Men - Indications:**
1. **Total testosterone <300 ng/dL** on two separate morning measurements + symptoms
2. **Symptomatic hypogonadism** with total T 300-400 ng/dL AND low free testosterone
3. **Lifestyle optimization failed** to improve symptoms or testosterone levels
4. **No contraindications** (prostate cancer, breast cancer, untreated sleep apnea, severe heart failure, elevated hematocrit)

**Men - Monitoring on TRT:**
- **Total testosterone:** Target 500-900 ng/dL (mid-normal range)
- **Free testosterone:** Target 15-25 pg/mL for symptom control
- **Hematocrit:** Monitor for polycythemia (goal <54%)
- **Estradiol:** Monitor for excessive aromatization (goal 20-30 pg/mL)
- **PSA:** Monitor in men >40 years (prostate health)
- **Symptom assessment:** Energy, libido, mood, muscle mass, fat mass
- **Follow-up:** 3 months after initiation, then every 6-12 months

**Women - Indications (More Controversial):**
1. **Low testosterone** (<15 ng/dL or calculated free T <1.5 pg/mL) + symptoms
2. **Postmenopausal women** with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)
3. **No response** to lifestyle optimization
4. **No contraindications** (pregnancy, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease)

**Women - Monitoring on TRT:**
- **Total testosterone:** Target premenopausal physiologic range (25-50 ng/dL), avoid supraphysiologic levels
- **Free testosterone:** Target 3-4 pg/mL
- **Watch for virilization:** Hirsutism, acne, voice deepening, clitoromegaly (indicates excessive dosing)
- **Symptom assessment:** Libido, energy, mood, muscle mass
- **Follow-up:** 3 months after initiation, then every 6-12 months

**Global Consensus (2019):**
- Testosterone therapy for women recommended for postmenopausal women with HSDD
- Should achieve blood concentrations approximating premenopausal physiological levels
- **Not recommended:** Diagnosis or treatment based on blood total testosterone level alone

**Source:** [PMC - Global Consensus on Testosterone Therapy for Women](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6821450/)

---

### 5. Special Populations

#### Aging Men (>60 years)

**Considerations:**
- Testosterone naturally declines ~1% per year after age 30
- SHBG increases with age → lower free testosterone even if total T stable
- **Most significant mortality benefit** from testosterone optimization in this age group
- Higher baseline cardiovascular risk → screen carefully before TRT
- Prostate health monitoring essential (PSA, DRE)

**Approach:**
- Lower threshold for intervention (total T <400 ng/dL + symptoms)
- Target mid-normal range (500-700 ng/dL), not high-normal
- Monitor closely for side effects (polycythemia, prostate changes, fluid retention)

**Evidence:** Men >65 with normal testosterone levels have 39% lower mortality than those with low testosterone (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.96)

---

#### Women with PCOS

**Considerations:**
- Hyperandrogenism defining feature (clinical and/or biochemical)
- Free testosterone more sensitive than total testosterone for diagnosis
- Treatment goal: **LOWER** testosterone to improve metabolic health and restore ovulation

**Diagnostic Criteria (Rotterdam Criteria - 2 of 3):**
1. Oligo-ovulation or anovulation
2. Clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism
3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound

**Biochemical Hyperandrogenism:**
- Total testosterone >70 ng/dL (>2.67 nmol/L) in some labs
- Free testosterone >3.6-5.7 pg/mL depending on assay
- Free androgen index (FAI) >5.5

**Treatment:**
- Weight loss (if overweight): Can restore ovulation, normalize testosterone
- Metformin: Improves insulin sensitivity, lowers testosterone
- Oral contraceptives: Suppress ovarian androgen production

#### Women in Perimenopause/Menopause

**Considerations:**
- Testosterone declines with age, more dramatically after menopause (ovarian production drops)
- Symptoms: Reduced libido, fatigue, decreased muscle mass, mood changes
- May benefit from testosterone therapy if symptomatic and low levels

**Testing:**
- **Postmenopausal reference range:** 7-40 ng/dL (lower than premenopausal)
- **Target for symptom management:** 15-35 ng/dL (or up to 90-200 ng/dL in some functional medicine protocols)
- **Always measure:** Total testosterone (LC-MS/MS), SHBG, calculate free testosterone

**Treatment:**
- **FDA-approved (outside US):** Intrinsa patch for HSDD in postmenopausal women
- **US:** Off-label use of testosterone preparations
- **Monitoring:** Avoid supraphysiologic levels, watch for virilization

**Evidence:** Global consensus supports testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with HSDD

---

#### Athletes and Performance

**Considerations:**
- Intense training can suppress testosterone ("exercise-induced hypogonadism")
- Overtraining syndrome: Low testosterone, high cortisol, fatigue, poor performance
- Exogenous testosterone use for performance enhancement: banned in sports, health risks

**Evaluation:**
- If athlete has low testosterone: Consider overtraining, low body fat, inadequate caloric intake, psychological stress
- Rule out pathologic causes (pituitary tumor, Klinefelter syndrome)

**Management:**
- Reduce training volume/intensity
- Increase caloric intake (especially carbohydrates, fats)
- Improve sleep
- Stress management
- Allow adequate recovery

**Monitoring:**
- Repeat testosterone after 3 months of lifestyle modification
- If persistently low, evaluate for hypogonadism

---

### 6. Interpretation Red Flags

**When to Investigate Further:**

**Men:**
- **Very low testosterone (<150 ng/dL):** Evaluate for Klinefelter syndrome, pituitary tumor, hemochromatosis
- **Low testosterone + low LH/FSH:** Evaluate pituitary (MRI, prolactin)
- **Low testosterone + high LH/FSH:** Primary hypogonadism (Klinefelter, testicular injury, chemotherapy)
- **Rapidly declining testosterone:** Evaluate for acute illness, medication changes, new comorbidities

**Women:**
- **Very high testosterone (>150 ng/dL):** Evaluate for androgen-secreting tumor (adrenal, ovarian)
- **Rapid virilization:** Tumor until proven otherwise
- **Prepubertal high testosterone:** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), evaluate 17-OH progesterone
- **High testosterone + normal periods:** May be PCOS, but also consider exogenous androgen use

**Both:**
- **Discordant total and free testosterone:** Recheck SHBG, albumin; verify assay accuracy
- **Symptoms don't match labs:** Repeat testing; consider other diagnoses (thyroid, depression, sleep apnea, anemia)

---

### 7. Documentation and Communication

**When Reporting Results to Patients:**

**Include:**
1. **Specific values with units** (total T in ng/dL, free T in pg/mL)
2. **Reference range** (conventional lab range)
3. **Functional optimal range** (if using functional medicine approach)
4. **Clinical interpretation:** Where patient falls on risk stratification
5. **Contributing factors:** SHBG status, age, time of day, medications
6. **Action plan:** Lifestyle optimization, repeat testing, or treatment

**Example Report Language:**

**Men:**
> "Your total testosterone is 380 ng/dL (conventional lab range: 300-1000 ng/dL). While this is technically 'normal,' it falls in the **suboptimal** range from a functional medicine perspective (optimal: 600-900 ng/dL). Your SHBG is elevated, which means your **free testosterone is 9 pg/mL** (optimal: 15-25 pg/mL), explaining your symptoms of fatigue and low libido.
>
> We'll start with lifestyle optimization: improving sleep, stress management, resistance training, and optimizing vitamin D and zinc. We'll recheck your levels in 3 months. If no improvement, we can discuss testosterone replacement therapy."

**Women:**
> "Your total testosterone is 12 ng/dL (conventional range: 10-55 ng/dL). Your calculated **free testosterone is 1.8 pg/mL**, which is below the functional optimal range of 3.25-4.6 pg/mL. This may be contributing to your low libido and fatigue.
>
> Let's first optimize your lifestyle: ensure adequate healthy fats in your diet, improve sleep quality, and manage stress. We'll also check your vitamin D and address any nutrient deficiencies. If symptoms persist after 3 months of optimization, we can consider low-dose testosterone therapy."

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### Total Testosterone

**Risk Curve:**
- **Men:** U-shaped (low and very high both risky; optimal in upper-middle range)
- **Women:** Linear-low (low is risky; optimal in mid-range; high indicates pathology)

**Optimal Ranges (Functional Medicine):**
- **Men:** 600-900 ng/dL (20.8-31.2 nmol/L)
- **Women (premenopausal):** 25-50 ng/dL (0.87-1.73 nmol/L)
- **Women (postmenopausal):** 15-35 ng/dL (0.52-1.21 nmol/L)

**Key Evidence:**
- Men with testosterone <300 ng/dL have 2x mortality risk
- TRAVERSE (2023): TRT safe for cardiovascular outcomes
- Optimal testosterone linked to better bone density, muscle mass, cognitive function, longevity

---

### Free Testosterone

**Risk Curve:**
- **Men:** U-shaped (low associated with symptoms even if total T normal; very high indicates exogenous use)
- **Women:** Linear-low (low associated with symptoms, metabolic risk; high indicates PCOS)

**Optimal Ranges (Functional Medicine):**
- **Men:** 15-25 pg/mL (52-86.7 pmol/L)
- **Women (premenopausal):** 3.25-4.6 pg/mL (11.3-15.9 pmol/L)

**Calculation:**
- **Vermeulen equation** (total T + SHBG + albumin): Recommended, nearly identical to gold standard
- **Equilibrium dialysis + LC-MS/MS:** Gold standard, expensive, limited availability
- **Direct immunoassay:** NOT recommended (inaccurate)

**Key Evidence:**
- Free testosterone essential when total T doesn't match symptoms
- SHBG critically affects bioavailable testosterone
- Women: Free T more sensitive than total T for PCOS diagnosis

---

### Clinical Integration

**Always Assess Together:**
- Total testosterone + SHBG + albumin → Calculate free and bioavailable testosterone
- Consider age, sex, menstrual cycle phase (women), time of day, medications
- Correlate with symptoms: libido, energy, mood, muscle mass, cognitive function

**Functional Medicine Approach:**
- Target optimal ranges (not just "normal")
- Lifestyle optimization first: sleep, exercise, stress management, nutrition, weight management
- Treat root causes: HPA axis dysfunction, insulin resistance, nutrient deficiencies
- Consider HRT only after lifestyle optimization and when clinically indicated

**Key Message:** Testosterone is a critical biomarker for metabolic health, cardiovascular risk, bone density, muscle mass, cognitive function, and longevity. Optimizing testosterone levels through lifestyle interventions and, when appropriate, hormone replacement therapy can significantly improve healthspan and lifespan.
